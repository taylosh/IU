Use pandas to download IBM stock data for year 2022 into a DataFrame, calculate 
and print the variance of close values using the given formula.
-xi is the stock close value on day i, xÌ… is the mean (average) of all stock close 
values in 2022 and n is
the number of rows in the DataFrame (equal to number of days the stock exchange 
was open in 2022). Calculate and print the standard deviation.
Find and print max and min closing stock values and the respective dates.
Print all numbers rounded to two decimal places.
