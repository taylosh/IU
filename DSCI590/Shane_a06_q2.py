Write a function body_mass_index(height, weight) which receives height in 
inches and weight in pounds, converts height to meters and weight to kilograms,
then calculates and returns the BMI.
Function main() prompts for personâ€™s height in inches and weight in pounds, 
calls body_mass_index(height, weight) to determine BMI and prints the BMI and 
a message telling whether the person is above, within or below the healthy range.
Function main() uses exception to check if the user enters a non-number. 
The function prints an error message and quits if the user enters a non-number 
or a negative number.
