<s> for our school years , all the student take a test to enter the university . <\s>
<s> before the exam , most of them are involved in a variety of activity , including valunteer , of course . <\s>
<s> because most university want to see their valueble activity . <\s>
<s> not just desent scores . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> however these days , many young people do n't have much time doing this . <\s>
<s> our educational system that forced to only focus on their school work . <\s>
<s> thus i strongly agree young peple do n't give enough time to helping their communities , as a student , some are even stay up night preparing exam . <\s>
<s> so it 's not wonder that they are rarely participate in off-school working , they devote to study other things like learning a languege , takeing a tuition . <\s>
<s> moreover although they are working at store for rest of their time , it is about lucrative things that can help them gain money , they just dabble in valunteering , and most of them are limited to help communities . <\s>
<s> and they consider working for community center is n't beneficial for them . <\s>
<s> instead of help , they are going to work for part time job , want to make a money , . <\s>
<s> forexample , my friends fail to <\s>
<s> I 'm agree whit this statement . <\s>
<s> For example , thinking to the i-pod , a new type of mp3 music , the advertisement that the productors do , is too unreal . <\s>
<s> They say that if you have this mp3 , you have more opportunities to be considered by your friends , or by other people , that you have something more that give you what other have n't , give you celebrity or more opportunity with the girls or the boys . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But this is only an object that beetwen a few months you will change because is out of mode . <\s>
<s> Is nothing special , it ca n't give you everything that they said . <\s>
<s> The producers use the pubblicity to bring the people , to influenced their choices and for doing it they must invent , they must associate to their object the figure of geat , wonderfull , special even if is a common object . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another examples could be rappresent by the use of yogurts for the regularity . <\s>
<s> In Italy there are more societies tha make yogurt to help the people to go to the bathroom , and they say that if you took one of this every day you can get it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But if you try , the quality that them could apport to you is not real how they said . <\s>
<s> It 's dipend from people to people . <\s>
<s> So we do n't believe in everything that they tell , because there is always someone that tends to tell a lay for having we to his part . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement because also in my country there are many academic that specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Many academic specialize in one specific subject for help the student for the future work . <\s>
<s> i think , we will be use fewer cars after twenty years more than today . <\s>
<s> car is important thing . <\s>
<s> if it ca n't development of cars , our life is not really good . <\s>
<s> for example , it takes a car who will go to company . <\s>
<s> and , it takes a car who will go to picnic . <\s>
<s> if now is after twenty years , car is ca n't forget thing of our life . <\s>
<s> i think car can fly in 2020 years . <\s>
<s> flying car is better more than we using car in today i think . <\s>
<s> we can go fatster morethan today 's car in 2020year . <\s>
<s> it is really good thing . <\s>
<s> but , gasollin is big problem . <\s>
<s> we are do n't have many gasollin . <\s>
<s> but , we 'll have fewer cars after 20 years . <\s>
<s> we must think problem of gasollin . <\s>
<s> our cars is good thing in today . <\s>
<s> for example , BMW is more popular than any car 's company . <\s>
<s> BMW company will be make more cars . <\s>
<s> and then , people want new car of BMW . <\s>
<s> so , people 'll having many thing of cars . <\s>
<s> it is not bad . <\s>
<s> but it is our plane will grew up to car 's plane . <\s>
<s> everytime , car traffic . <\s>
<s> everytime , car accident . <\s>
<s> it is so bad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> i think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> but , car accident and car traffic is will be more than there are today . <\s>
<s> I agree with this idea . <\s>
<s> Because , I think for be successful people They need have confidence themself decision and think . <\s>
<s> So , I think if , people who scared of risk or do n't want to take risk . <\s>
<s> That kind person ca n't be successful people . <\s>
<s> Because , I think this word is realistic and useful for this world `` No risk No return . '' <\s>
<s> `` High risk High return . '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people they have confidence themselves . <\s>
<s> So , they can creat new thing and they can try to new thing . <\s>
<s> If people do n't have confidence themselves , they ca n't creat anything . <\s>
<s> how they even can try new thing . <\s>
<s> That mean is they even can take a risk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If , people feel satisfy and they tend to defence itself about sociallity position and money . <\s>
<s> According that word `` No risk No return '' I think they just will lose money and position . <\s>
<s> If people feel satisfaction about their potision and money , they do n't want do anything without difende themselves . <\s>
<s> People gearn money from their move . <\s>
<s> Even smart people or people who do n't have any creer and skills , they ca n't earn money without move . <\s>
<s> So , simply People who only do defence , they ca n't earn money . <\s>
<s> Although , they need money for defence themselves . <\s>
<s> Those days , everybody wants to be rich . <\s>
<s> However , everybody does not become rich , so we can have a guestion which is `` why people do not become rich people '' . <\s>
<s> Because successful people already know to do well . <\s>
<s> Therefore i agree with sueccessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> First of all , the successful people have a lots of experioues . <\s>
<s> When somebody spent a lot of power , time and attempt , the some - body become the rich guy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second of all , when we try something and solve risks , we need money to do something . <\s>
<s> Nowday money can make aother money . <\s>
<s> For example , my father invested something 5 years ago , but the inventhing was not famous because , at that time , my father did not has money . <\s>
<s> My father tried to make famous , it was fail . <\s>
<s> However , when my father had a lot of money , my could make a famous product and than he was able to make a lot of money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In brief , successful people try new things and make money e <\s>
<s> The adeverstisin plays important role in our life today . <\s>
<s> Today , Many commericals spend thousdnd of dollars for thier products to sell . <\s>
<s> The Markting department paly good work to market the product . <\s>
<s> There are many things can help the company the buy the product . <\s>
<s> For example , advertising . <\s>
<s> Adverstising can be make in many diffrent way such as , magazine , newpaper , T.V commerical ad and on the street . <\s>
<s> some advertising make the products be much better , others not . <\s>
<s> However , the advertising make product much better than they really . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advertising tray to hock the reader . <\s>
<s> For example , last monthe , i bought a product for skin , actully i bought the product beacuse the adevrtising got my attention . <\s>
<s> Then , after i use the product i realized not like the effective of its advertising . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The goal for any comapny company increase thier profit by buy more products . <\s>
<s> The company spend alot of money for the advertising to buy their produts . <\s>
<s> In my experince , i worked for a company , and i saw how this is important to buy the prodcuts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , the advertising make products mush better , and the companies donot care for the products unless by increase their income . <\s>
<s> I am agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Because nowadays peoples has so many convinient tools and living under the good enviroments . <\s>
<s> Tipically in young peoples like school ages , they do n't have to work for to living . <\s>
<s> So I think , young people nowadays and all age peoples can take enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , I think a small part of young people dose not have or can not make enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> My conclusion of above line come from the wonder of their life style . <\s>
<s> A small number of nowadays young people living in so stressful world . <\s>
<s> For example , pressure of there job norma , working skedules , etc . <\s>
<s> Recentry people become phycometry disease so easily . <\s>
<s> Something of our life style become strange from old time . <\s>
<s> Now , I think we needs re-thing about our community and our relatively . <\s>
<s> Most of us forgets our heartfull rerationships and our true meanings of life . <\s>
<s> I think we can use community relationships for our rehabilitations of emotional problems . <\s>
<s> So finally I agree again this statements with hopes for future . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement because most of the the subjects you have to understnad ideas and to learn facts but some you gust need to understand the ideas of the subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of the students understand the ideas and most the gust learn the fact for my popenion it 's better to understnad the ideas t 's easyer and it 's more helpfull . <\s>
<s> Some subjects need to be understood and some need to know the facts like math you need to understand the rule and know how to use it and in Biology you need to know to need to know the fact and then understand the way let 's say they way of people living . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of the people understand they ways liek when you work you gust need to know the way of the work for a person who works as at a company and he 's a programmer he just need to do the programmes got they company like that you gust understand the way you should do it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is always they way that people use there ways of knowing the thing for me it 's better to understand what you should do and not to learn the fact , let 's say i have a physics class i have understand the rules and i have to know how to use them but most important is that you use the way that is most easyer for you . <\s>
<s> Yes , I agree with statement that young people enojy more than older people . <\s>
<s> At the young people enjoy lot with the friends by going movies , by parting but the older people as to there work in the office and had to see the family problems , finacial problem and at that they ca n't enjoy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people will enjoy more because they had no family , finacial problems the only is to study but this is not big problem as they can do by suding before exams until they can play , can do parties , go to movies , can go to tours . <\s>
<s> As young will not going to come young people remember these things in the old age . <\s>
<s> Example , for the young people enjoy than older is , in school days we did more thing in the school with my friends such as to make jokes and make fun with others but we manage the people whom we make fun atlast . <\s>
<s> Finally , they also does not take seriously and doing this we can get fun a we able recollect these things at the older age . <\s>
<s> Another example is when we tour in school days we miss the way with teachers and we went to another place we had struck there for one day we had enjoy there by missing as we go to different place but fianlly we made our way that our teacher were , this is one which i will not going to forget . <\s>
<s> By watching movies we can enjoy lot as all the friends will be going to be there . <\s>
<s> Another one where we enjoy is the parties as all friends will gather there an do different things and that joy will be not present in the older people even they do parties , they only can say their problems finally , we must enjoy the young age as it will be not going to come again but only the rememberance what we had done in the young age <\s>
<s> First of all . <\s>
<s> I agree with `` most advertisements make products seem much better than thy really are. '' because If I have company then I make some advertisments for some products . <\s>
<s> And I show them in the TV for the people , also I show them in the streets , but I shwo them in a bad way . <\s>
<s> I mean they were seem bad or ugly . <\s>
<s> Then nobady going to by anything from my commpny . <\s>
<s> they going to put ex on it ( all the people goning to heat it ) . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Any way any one wants to make an advertisements have to show them seem gret way . <\s>
<s> To attreact people to that kind of product wich mide the advertisements for it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Here is the example for two people mide two advertisments for two diffrent kinds of bayby milk . <\s>
<s> The first ont showed the bayby milk with darty stuff and with sick child . <\s>
<s> Also the pearson showed that advertisment with bad music . <\s>
<s> The second one showed the bayby milk with clean stuff and with cutte bayby . <\s>
<s> Also with nice music . <\s>
<s> Now here is the bottom line . <\s>
<s> The people who wictched the two advertisements , wich kind of milk they are going to buy ? . <\s>
<s> Difnlay the second one , because it has really great stuff and really great way to ahwo the bayby milk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> That even in other products . <\s>
<s> itis depend how the product showing . <\s>
<s> and wht the gifts come with it . <\s>
<s> Also if it has good offer or not . <\s>
<s> I mean it is depend how is the product shwoing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> That was my opinion if I agree or disagree with `` most advertisments make products seem much better than the really are . '' <\s>
<s> And igreed with that . <\s>
<s> Advertisements , the word that because it I start to be crazy . <\s>
<s> Everywhere , everytime you will see or hear an ad . <\s>
<s> Because the many times that you had saw it or heared it you start to lose thier truth . <\s>
<s> With the incresing in tchnology you are surround with ads from every where while you at the home , while you in the car , while you using the cell phone or the intrernet , and know while you using the puplic bathroom !! . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I belive that the ads some times let me buy a product but when thay start to show again and again , I start not to trust on the product . <\s>
<s> In tha past , the ads used to tell the people about new products and that 's it . <\s>
<s> But know the show the same prduct but with an offer . <\s>
<s> This thing create a question , why they make an offer if thier product is succefel . <\s>
<s> I heared a say that said `` If your product cost 500 you should spend 1,000 for an ad '' did you see the multbly of the number . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this day the ways that the company use to create an ad is so crasy . <\s>
<s> Like Nike , they spend more than 1,000,000,000 in thier ads . <\s>
<s> I do not mean that thier products are not good but I mean thy shoult trust thierself . <\s>
<s> athoer example Hyandai when they made thier cars with BMW cars . <\s>
<s> Or other company whene thay pay for a star to make an ad for them , and with this all the people who love this star will do what s/he did . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is seem cleare that the compnies start losing there customer because the hard work they do it to present thier product . <\s>
<s> and I think if they pay all this mone to improner the producte will be abetter than to spend it in ads . <\s>
<s> I think that it 's better to have a preparation in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic , because the work 's of world research students specialized . <\s>
<s> For example in my experience of student at the politecnico of Milan , the are two main streets for to follow . <\s>
<s> You can to do three years or five years ; the main difference is that at the third year of engineering you must to decide your address of study . <\s>
<s> for example veicles , turbomachines , industrials fields , materials ... <\s>
<s> at the end you must to do an work 's experience in a factory . <\s>
<s> This permit to know the new work 's world early and more fastely , while if you choose five years have more broad knowledge of more subject but less specialized . <\s>
<s> Successful people are famous because they doing something very well ... <\s>
<s> or not . <\s>
<s> If they are famous without skills , it 's because they are pretty , rich , or they were at the good time in the good place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A lot of successful people makes several thing : The singers become actors , the athletes become singers , the actors become politics ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This sentence explain a problem : the diversification of the succesful people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The most difficult things for an artist is to enter in the famous artists closed class . <\s>
<s> Because an artist must prove that he 's talented to the people , but the best way to prove he is talented is the medias . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But when we watching television we see always the same artists . <\s>
<s> The problem is not to see these artists , but it 's to see these artists in a another place . <\s>
<s> For instance when i see Paris Hilton , who are not talented , singing , it 's worried . <\s>
<s> It is worried for two reasons : The first is that she has not skills in this , and she can show her sings at televisions , and sell cds . <\s>
<s> The second reason , is that she take the place to a really singer , a really artists , unfamous . <\s>
<s> Her wealth allows Paris Hilton to be know as an artist . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of example such than parisd <\s>
<s> In this point of statement , i think is difficult to people who try new thing take risk . <\s>
<s> I disagree with statement because i think people try new thing have lot of avantages than only doing what they already know how to do well because when you try a thing likes cloth or shoes they can see if it 's good or not and if it is their size . <\s>
<s> But only doing what they already know how to do well is extremely difficult and take risk , they just feeling if that product is good . <\s>
<s> It 's not usually feeling show that product is good even though it is new . <\s>
<s> The second one they can not taste it . <\s>
<s> Maybe , after bought new think without taste and go home at far place where things were bought what whould they do ? <\s>
<s> There many disavantage when they only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I prefer try new things before , at least i would make more <\s>
<s> I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> There are a lots of things to do in the world , kinds of foods to eat , many works to do , and relaxtion to find , all the tings are must <\s>
<s> I deagree withe thise statment because of alot of reasons I have and I think I can convince you with tese resons . <\s>
<s> First of all , I think after twenty years the worled will develop and thire will be alot of thing will change in thise small world because of every ten years a new company come so ane cars come that will lead us to have alot of cars and thire will be apolution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , Ithink the cars will be every where and in every places we live . <\s>
<s> nowaday , many people was successful something . <\s>
<s> i think these people want to try doing anything . <\s>
<s> this mean , these people already tried to do a lot of things . <\s>
<s> i think many people have a lot of chances . <\s>
<s> if the people do not try to do anythii agree the this tropic sentence . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> first , many people lost a lot of money but this is just first inventment themseves . <\s>
<s> on the businesses , they know how to change depression of the world . <\s>
<s> they can rapaid every thing then they can return a lot of money . <\s>
<s> if the people extend many businesses , they can separete many ways . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> second , they have a lot of experiences and skills . <\s>
<s> they know a lot of bad things and good things . <\s>
<s> this mean , they know how to get a lot of information because they have good communication experiences and skills . <\s>
<s> if the people can speak many different countiy 's languages , they are possible to go to many different counity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> third , they also have good partners . <\s>
<s> i think the partners are very important things because they are kind of the supporters . <\s>
<s> if i have my own company , i can ask and encouguse everything . <\s>
<s> it is possile to go out some places very eaily . <\s>
<s> also they can try to do something with these partners . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> in conclusion , i think they know a lot of risks but they have lot of money , have a lot of experiences , skill , and have good partners . <\s>
<s> for these reasons , i think it is possible to try to do everything . <\s>
<s> I think that is most important for everyone to have a broad knowledge of many arguments , at the sometime I think that is foundamental for everyone to have specific knowledge in one subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For some aspects I prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because in this way I can to have many possibility of choise for my future . <\s>
<s> For other aspect I prefer to have a specialize knowledge in one specific area ; in this way I can do my work better and with most capacity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Generally I am agree with this statement because today every studets want to go at the university and , in this way , they can choise better the course in wich they want to specialize . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think also that the primary and the high school must to give to the student the struments and the capacity to build theire future like they want . <\s>
<s> New things will never stop coming to people 's life . <\s>
<s> Some people belive that during their lifetime must try all the new things or you will be cut off the line . <\s>
<s> Others belived trying to do a new thing is just wasting time . <\s>
<s> I however belived that do not kit new things out your door . <\s>
<s> Because , using a new thing can help people learn more stuff , can catch the line of world 's change , having fun by working in new things . <\s>
<s> When people already knows how to do some thing well , no one will want to use extra time to study another thing . <\s>
<s> But nobody will uninteristed by a new thing . <\s>
<s> Even doing so well in one job or something still can try new things . <\s>
<s> It could be use in the old thing you are doing so well or may find another way to use for the things that already know very well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> World is changing every day . <\s>
<s> Many years ago , people use pen and paper to write a letter to their family to tell family they are doing well aborade . <\s>
<s> It takes a month to get the letter . <\s>
<s> In that time people still using horse for ride . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , people use Internet to view the news to chat and the most popular way to send family `` I 'm doing well. '' is e-mail . <\s>
<s> People do not need use a day to get to another town . <\s>
<s> We have car , train and airplan to travel around the world . <\s>
<s> Trying new things is not weasting time , it could saving much more time for people to do the things they want to do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Starting doing a new things . <\s>
<s> It could be very hard and boring . <\s>
<s> But still can find a lot fun by doing it . <\s>
<s> People may making a lot mistake when they trying a new thing , after know how to use it then think about the mistake you are making you may laugh at your self . <\s>
<s> Also people would find out another way to saving time to do more things they would like and want to do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> New things is not a bad thing to try . <\s>
<s> If people just close the door for new things the things will lose in your life could be a lot . <\s>
<s> Taking new things is not tell people put down what you are doing , is tell people to try things , it would help you a lot . <\s>
<s> Some people think that life is more beautiful when you get older , because they think that the elder people would be supposed to have experienced almost everything that a person ever could in her/his life . <\s>
<s> They also think that spending time with the grandchildren is the most enjoying thing in the world . <\s>
<s> I do not think so . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Life is beautifel even you are younger . <\s>
<s> If you are younger then you will be more energetic almost for everything . <\s>
<s> You could do all the tiresome activities , you could run at the sea with your lover , you could dance with your lover till midnight and you would have the passion to make love with her/him . <\s>
<s> I accept that there are some elder people who could run faster than some younger people or who could do harder activities , But they are exception and they are in minority . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Younger people also think that there is a long and happy life in future . <\s>
<s> They could probably die before they reach their 60's . <\s>
<s> But they do not accept it in their minds . <\s>
<s> They live without the fear of death . <\s>
<s> But the elder people would live with this fear . <\s>
<s> The death may catch them in every seconds . <\s>
<s> No I do n't think so . <\s>
<s> Because , world population is growing up rapidly . <\s>
<s> Therfore the car user increase in twenty yers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The person who have a opposite view to me might think about increasing of population case something bad to nature . <\s>
<s> For example , acid rain and greenhouse effection . <\s>
<s> The gas from the car is one of the biggest reason of air polusion . <\s>
<s> If these problems get worse in twenty years , it seem to have strict control by the goverment to solve these problem . <\s>
<s> So it might be decresing the car users . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But I think we do n't have to worry about that . <\s>
<s> Because today , there are car which are moved by solar system and natural oraganisum oil . <\s>
<s> `` Purius `` invented by HONDA is a kind of car uses the solar system to work . <\s>
<s> It is quite expensive but it must be less expensive in future . <\s>
<s> And a lot of country try to make oils or gasolines which made from natural thing , So there are much more cars in use in twenty years . <\s>
<s> I mean the car that is kind to nature and human beings . <\s>
<s> I am not young people , but I was . <\s>
<s> When I was a young boy , I believe there is no higher principle of helping people . <\s>
<s> But I have read the article at the newspaper which is young people nowadays not to try their time to spend helping other people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think this is caused because of 2 reasons . <\s>
<s> The first , it is bacuse of the development of indusry . <\s>
<s> as Industry developing . <\s>
<s> We are more care about the study of technic and scicene than subject of moral activity . <\s>
<s> In the scool , the student and some of the teacher are focusing only on their classroom to go the University . <\s>
<s> They do n't want to teach and study human ' basic moral Value any more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the western culture made our yound people selfish . <\s>
<s> Traditionally , Korean peoples are kind and like to help each other . <\s>
<s> but after the 20th century , western culture inported to Korea so fast and widely . <\s>
<s> that makes our young people changed i believe . <\s>
<s> Being knowledgeable is very important for students to use them forever . <\s>
<s> So ideas and concepts which are improving their pointviews . <\s>
<s> I want to give an example to this discussion . <\s>
<s> When students take the historical class . <\s>
<s> we understand easily that school administiration requires this class to improve and provide national conciousness . <\s>
<s> Thus students need to conciousness . <\s>
<s> They do not need to details for their future life . <\s>
<s> Not only the historical class but also all classes should be considered by students . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> when they finish their school and enter to the competitive life . <\s>
<s> They will understand easily than before . <\s>
<s> Social and working life are required to be practice and comfortable all around the life . <\s>
<s> It is worth to say that student should learn the best ideas and concepts to eliminate from the others which is not necessary for them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Briefly being knowledgeable is most important for students . <\s>
<s> They must select the best one which include the best ideas and concept to save their future . <\s>
<s> Livng is learning and dicovering , some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , I think that young people enjoy life more than other people do but they can not realize it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A child is innocent , he is under his parent responsability , compare to the adult life , there is not many difficulties , his parents take care of it . <\s>
<s> He has to go to school but have a plenty of time to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Normally during the chilhood , life is like a cocoon . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During the teenage , new difficulties apear , and the teenager has to find himself , sometimes he get lost but his parents still directing him Then he become more independant , living his life alone , he is an adult now . <\s>
<s> Bad things happen but when great hing happen he can realizes it whereas the child was not able to . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My point is there , children might enjoy life more but they have nothing to compare what they are living at the moment whereas adults h <\s>

<s> knowledge is more important than work . <\s>
<s> knowledge improves ur skills , ability to do work . <\s>
<s> To get a knowledge mainly by doing practical things . <\s>
<s> knowledge plays a important role in every student . <\s>
<s> It is a essential thing to every human . <\s>
<s> TO get get knowledge we read different books and by practical application . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think tht to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important . <\s>
<s> because knowing to all the subjects we have a greater idea among all subjects . <\s>
<s> It is applicable to undergraduate level . <\s>
<s> I suggest tht why it is imp to study or get knowledge from all things tht we have a idea what will happened in our surroundings or in the society . <\s>
<s> If u do a job it is not only connected to ur subjects but also to other llike how to manage a problem if u faced , and how to communicate with the other people . <\s>
<s> It is not only related to ur subject it also related with other subjects . <\s>
<s> Upto under graduate level u will study or have a knowledge from many other subjects . <\s>
<s> It is useful to study a single subject means to say tht specialization it is important in graduate level . <\s>
<s> In the undergraduate level u must get the knowledge from teachers . <\s>
<s> In that level u just know tht how this problems has effects ? . <\s>
<s> How to solve the problems . <\s>
<s> To get more details about tht topic teachers help and to teach u.They want to train u how the details should be included to ur answer . <\s>
<s> By knowing the the all subjects it wiil help to increse ur knowledge . <\s>
<s> BUt in graduation level u u need not want u train by the professors . <\s>
<s> At this time they want to preapare for their own . <\s>
<s> ATt this level speciualisation is important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I want to conclude tht it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more important . <\s>
<s> I think tht it is more impotant in the undergraduate level . <\s>
<s> To get the ideas from many subjects this is important while doing jobs and we shift to other countries or places to know the knowledge about tht is so much helpable to us . <\s>
<s> by dont getting the knowledge from all subjects it does not help , and also any subject it does not deals only tht topic it is interrelated with all other toppics . <\s>
<s> so i conclude that get knowledge from all other subjects is important . <\s>
<s> in the undergraduate level . <\s>
<s> it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts is to be good . <\s>
<s> i agree the above statement . <\s>
<s> students firstly understand the any concepts and under standing the ideas in that topics which one have to be lies that topics has to be eliminated . <\s>
<s> firstly students has to be hear the concepts and in that concepts which one has to be facts that should be selected . <\s>
<s> there is one exampe is there gandhiji who does not tells lies at the end of the life . <\s>
<s> he studied number books and he has to be taking only fact concepts are to be taking . <\s>
<s> he also tells fact concepts to the students . <\s>
<s> secondly students has to be taking only good ideas he does not taking any bad ideas . <\s>
<s> i m telling one example for this concept . <\s>
<s> godsay is the one of the man who killed gandhiji . <\s>
<s> godsay has to be taking only bad ideas and concepts and those concepts he killed gandhiji . <\s>
<s> those type of incidents has to be done in our daily life . <\s>
<s> those ideas should be prevented in our daily life students are very sharp in their mind set . <\s>
<s> they are very silly in their behaviour . <\s>
<s> that type of behaviour has to be removed . <\s>
<s> students has to be improving thetir skills and concepts and ideas that should be used in right way . <\s>
<s> students are having very good communication skills in present day life . <\s>
<s> that skills has to be used in right way . <\s>
<s> we have use that skills in wrong way very dangerous aspects should be taken place . <\s>
<s> lastly i m telling students used their ideas to the society . <\s>
<s> and also we to take our ideas in science and improving any type of the object that should be help full to the society . <\s>
<s> Learning is a very important part of students life . <\s>
<s> I think learning in any form adds to ones information and knowledge areas . <\s>
<s> Therefore in my opinion when a student is at undergraduate level he should take variety of courses both in the areas of learning facts and understanding ideas and concept . <\s>
<s> On the otherhand when a student is taking up a graduate program he or she should take up a course which involves understanding the concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> For example taking a professional course in the understaning of Computers is better than studying history or geography . <\s>
<s> I beleive that task becomes easier and more enjoyable if one tries to understand instead of memorizing it . <\s>
<s> Thus a practical approach is better than rote learning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I feel learning facts is not as much interesting as understanding concepts . <\s>
<s> Thus I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> now a days the publisity is the best way to promoved a produt and if you wanth to sale a product you should bring some information that makes , that the people who is seeing the advertisements make sure that the product very good and in the future this person could buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the way that people do this acdevertisements are to impres people in some cases the thing that the advertisement give you in not the real impretion , althought if that product liked you when you see you would able to bring it because before you saw an advertisement that make sure that is a very good product but you also are not sure that it whould be like the one which you saw at the picture before . <\s>
<s> althought you will buy the produtc because the advertisement give you a good explaneation of that products and tahat is some thing taht is very good in the advertisments put some thing that express that the product is the best and tahat you should buy it , when you get the product some times when you use it in some cases is not the one who was you speacting or is not what you are speacting and you do not buy it again because that did not get you feel counfortable and that is the problem that have to trust in the advertisements tahat you could get dissapointment with pruducts tahat in some cases make to many publisity and they are not wath people expect . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> to conclude you should not trust all the times in advertisements because they are in some cases a lie some products make to many advertisement and they at final are not good it just to make people buy it at first time and did not expect what they want . <\s>
<s> I agree with this topic . <\s>
<s> because young people have so many time to play something . <\s>
<s> I think that yonug people is time during student . <\s>
<s> I am a student now and I enjoy everything so I have many time . <\s>
<s> And if I become a adult , I want to returrn my memory that I enjoy when I am a student . <\s>
<s> Maybe all adult has remembered their memory that they are a child <\s>
<s> today as education developing , there are more and more people can choose what they want to learn and when they want to learn , however where , in various situations , I think what kind of knowledge we recived should be depond on which subject we want to learn . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> firstly , when we are in basic aducation , such as in primary school . <\s>
<s> in that time , we should get broad knowlege and learn as such as we can , no matter where and when . <\s>
<s> we can get knowlege from broad areas . <\s>
<s> there are a lot of interesting for children at that time . <\s>
<s> for example , we will be learn math , music , history , and genernal knowledge . <\s>
<s> more knowledge we get more telent we are look like . <\s>
<s> and there will become a bai <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> but when we are in high education , such as college or unveristy . <\s>
<s> we must choose the speci , one hand the college or university will seprate different departments . <\s>
<s> such as , for the college student first need to decide what kind of subject he wants to learn , and then dicide which specific subject for his further study . <\s>
<s> and some of them do the specific researches about their subject . <\s>
<s> such as scientists , or doctors . <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Sucessful people always try new things if they take risks . <\s>
<s> Pesonally , they do n't care about risks and they are sick of their boring life , I suppose . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Among many reasons , the most important reason is that Successful people have an ambitious in their mind . <\s>
<s> They always try to obtain their new ways . <\s>
<s> Because They want to be the first one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> They think , Being best is more important than doing best . <\s>
<s> To be the first is a big achievement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , They need strengthen their own company if they have it . <\s>
<s> It is not easy to make more strengthen it . <\s>
<s> But they know how to manage their own money and how to manage people . <\s>
<s> because they are successful people already . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , I would like say that Sucessful people have an ambitious . <\s>
<s> I disagree the yong people do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> I guess every people should respect and help each other . <\s>
<s> Joining community is good way to learn any little society of the group . <\s>
<s> The young people should take communication in the community place as possible as they can . <\s>
<s> Now , we have a many ways to communicate with person who you are interested in . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , some younger generations does not like to give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , Giving enough time to their community is the important for yong people . <\s>
<s> I understand that some yong people would like to be alone thermselfs and keep their own time . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , it is good chance to think own proble just themselves , however , the person who joined the community may gives a second opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , in the young people community , they can meet your friends in the community . <\s>
<s> We do not alive without our community . <\s>
<s> In my experices , I found my best friends in my communities when I was 17years old . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , young people should give to help their communities . <\s>
<s> Young people can learn any educational experiences from their communities . <\s>
<s> Sometimes young people communies make some troubles but you should not be shy to join community . <\s>
<s> - I agree with most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> In these time the technology play the big <\s>
<s> the starting statement tells about the possibility that in the future could be less cars then today . <\s>
<s> this point is very difficult to explain because i think that everything depends to the technology developement of today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> since ten years ago a lot of university departments have tried to create a new type of car that uses a different king of oil . <\s>
<s> the reason is that in this moment the amount of oil is critical and there is the possibility that on the next years it will be impossible to supply the oil quantity that customers will need . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> but until now it is not appeared a different kind of car that uses alternative fuel . <\s>
<s> only a strange electric car that uses electric batteries to start motor . <\s>
<s> For this reason , i think that if the companies which product car or the university departments of technology resource do n't look for other solutions , it will be possible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today . <\s>
<s> In away i do agree because its god to try new things and taks risks allso , but not to much it debase on the risk that you taken , and the thing that you will do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> for exampel , a man or women nows abuot mecanis and want to try electrecs no prablom its allmost in the same maiger , thets the way i can tell it ok to take the risk and its a new thing too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But they shud n't take in baialogical or in speed rasing and they do n't now about rasing . <\s>
<s> So thers is a lement for the risks that they well take becouse thre a lemit for the risk that they taken . <\s>
<s> In another way i think ho want to do a new thing and take the risk should be a matuer person and nows what hes doing in the same time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> so he or she can make shuore that they are in the right plac , or they can get help from another people like people wheth experunes and , have the careg and , successful too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So i think now you see the defrent in the two parts of being successful and try to do new things and take the risk in asafe way wheth help from experiens people and taking the risks in fare defrant way wheth out nowing what you are doing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> people ho think of being in the same thing of what they now are ether fraid of doing somthing new or fraid of taking the risk becouse they want to be cabted insaid like bing in him self becouse he or she thinks it will make him or here unsuccessful and they will lose the canfedanents thats in them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end i think people shoul be more canfedanent in them selfs . <\s>
<s> Helping communities is avery good work . <\s>
<s> every sigle person can help his communities by diffrent ways . <\s>
<s> Young people have the energy , health and the ideas , so they can use all these for thinking in smart ways for helping thier communities . <\s>
<s> In my country there is a large number of young people a round 60 % . <\s>
<s> Thy are busy in there self , thy dont spend time to help the society that they live in . <\s>
<s> I think to solve this problem , it needs to put a plan . <\s>
<s> By encouriging the students in the schools and the universities to valenter to help the communitie , by visiting the hospitals , the houses for the old people and every way where can they help . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And important thing , that we never plaim them or trying to fee that they are gelty . <\s>
<s> I agree at It is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> First , when stundents understand the ideas and concepts , I think they then learn the facts easily . <\s>
<s> the undersatnd ideas and the concepts help students learn informations about the many subjects and acccept good education form information the have . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second . <\s>
<s> I think understand ieads and concepts make the student are opened mind to acccept new ieads or researshs may come in the future . <\s>
<s> and I thin also the important to student to understnad ideas and concepts to encourage them to look for more information n the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , understand ideas and the concepts let student accept and disscus any issue may they would face them and dealing with any new ideas by carefull and responsibility also understand ideas and concepts make the eager for make their ideas and their concepts Forth , I think the understand ideas and concepts give confident for students for themselves because they have a lot of ideas and concepts about various thins and the maybe help them to going in the life and make their own working . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree with this statement if it is refered to car as a veichle used to go to work or during the summer holiday . <\s>
<s> Today the car is the most important veichle adopted by the men to move between the cities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The global population is growing and for this the car use should growth in twenty years . <\s>
<s> Well , I agree to this statment if it is refered to use the cars during the motions between nations . <\s>
<s> The big distance between che nation 's capital is very problem . <\s>
<s> now adays most of the people are trying new things without taking risk , in my opinion it 's a wrong thing , 1st of all when we are going to try something new we should ask about it , specially we should ask the pirson who tried this thing , 2nd the successful people try new things and take risks , i want to tell something from my own experiences , i have a cousin & he want to buy a new car and i warned him ' i told him this car is not good it 's spending petrol & it 's not fast car also it 's expensive car , he told that i do n't believe you & i will buy this car , i told him it 's up to you , after one month he came for me & he told you that i was right when i told him not to buy that car , also that i have i friend & he want to marrie one girl in the university i told him that i know this girl & she 's always preparing date with a other men , he told me that you are jaleous , i told him ok do what ever you want , after 6 months he came & told you are right , i heared her voice talking with another guy & i was shocked , so i think we should ask the people who have experiences before we try anything new , it 's better for us , from now on we should learn to ask the people about something we want to try it i think it 's not a shame to ask question , i ve got a lesson from my cousin & my friend , that 's u should't try new thing before asking the old person or the person who have an experiences <\s>
<s> I do n't know if be agree with this idea or not . <\s>
<s> I would like it . <\s>
<s> I hope is the result of a scienific research so to be suppored by statistic , sociology , psicology and university professors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The only idea I can use to approach this thing in a scientific way is to think abouth the forces around this topic . <\s>
<s> There are 2 things who confirme my hope : the traffic and the cost of petrol . <\s>
<s> From the other side ther are other 2 things that destroy my hope , they are : the number of people how live in good economic conditions , the economic car business thet in more than one country is supported by the central governament . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Starting from the traffic , in the biggest cities in the world , from Milano and Roma to Tokyo , London or New York the traffic problem is very very big . <\s>
<s> A possible solution is the growt of public transport . <\s>
<s> For example the underground ( or tube like in London is colled ) is prefered by a great number of people respect the car to move in the city . <\s>
<s> For the petrol cost , I think that is to long and to complicate for me to approach a solution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From the other side lukely ( with economic growt ) today more people can buy a car then 30 years ago , so is possible that more people buy the car . <\s>
<s> More than this , the car in some places ( in rapid growt in the last years ) are considered like a status simbol , a way to confirm the economic power of the family <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> NOTE : our focus abouth the use of the cars and not abouth how many cars will be buy . <\s>
<s> History of succeful peoples Clearly tels that without Risk Develapment of human kind will be only a big Zero like sun or moon . <\s>
<s> I totaly agreed with the statement success come only in the way of risk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Take an example of sceince world thin life without electisity , computers , aroplains , butiful cars and most importent life healing madisince . <\s>
<s> without word `` Experiment '' Scince world is nathing and the other name of experiment is Risk , and trying new things is risk . <\s>
<s> Which it self shows the importance of Risk in succesful persons like Eanstine and manu other scentists who made this world comfertable and Energetic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Know take an example of field of politics . <\s>
<s> In Field of poletics take an example of Mahatma Gandhi Who took risk and applied new way of revolutin in India HE works on the princeple that `` Peas '' . <\s>
<s> While during the revolution he ford against britishers with Peas No wepone no violence fight but onle the peace wich worked very well and he got the success in result of indipendence of India . <\s>
<s> He is not the only one person in politics Who is successful while taking risk or tring new things but there are many . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Know take another example from the History , The great sea explorers Who discoverd America , india and many countries If they have not taken the risk and tried new paths definatly our The world will be like a hevenly body like moon , black and dark . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the conclusion i again states that Without taking Risk of tring new things life is Nathing but only like a wild life ie Bournd , lived and fianly died . <\s>
<s> For me the meaning of life is to work for success by tyring new thing and taking risk . <\s>
<s> and achiving my goals and targets . <\s>
<s> The successful way <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I want to ask all persons who are unsuccessful , Do you think differient between you and a successful person ? <\s>
<s> thies essay I will write about a sccessful people . <\s>
<s> They are try anew things and think about it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Who want to be a successful persone . <\s>
<s> He have to be a smart and think about any thing he want . <\s>
<s> For Exampel some people when they went to sapermarket . <\s>
<s> They dont know what they want . <\s>
<s> Just when they arrived to sopermarket . <\s>
<s> They will take any thing they see . <\s>
<s> In other hand they a successful person who is know what he exactuly want . <\s>
<s> He will save his mony and he will save his time too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Asccessful people are read to many books , and see onther person how is he becam asuccessful person . <\s>
<s> In the past to many people who were asuccessful . <\s>
<s> They were know what will happend now , because they were read and know how the people think . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> fainally if you want to become a successful person , you have to read about history and about anther culterl . <\s>
<s> I think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today . <\s>
<s> Because scientists are researching a wide range of new transfortations . <\s>
<s> Now , humakind face the cricis of energe lack , so we need to invent new alternative . <\s>
<s> If they invent environmental trasportation , the number of cars will decline . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result , I agree that cars in use will be fewer and fewer . <\s>
<s> I am agree the most advertisement make products seem much better that tehy really are for following two reasons , the most of advertisements make their products looks better then they are , the advertisements hired good looking and body to deceive the specially people , First of all , most of advetisements make their products looks so fine . <\s>
<s> For example , MC Donald always show the people eat energiclly food in the moring and it will provide the nutrition in a day . <\s>
<s> But they did n't say how fat per chicken , if you eat two meals in the morning , how much weight you will gain . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the nike company they hired the sport star to do exercise and show it on TV , but it is not to demostrate if we wear the specially products , we will become expert in this area . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , most of advertisement , they always foucus the distinguished gruop of people and show the grest idea in it . <\s>
<s> For instances , in my country , they have an organization for fat people , they made a special plan for each person and promise it will sucessfully to lose your weight in a month . <\s>
<s> They hired the model who have good looking and body and claimed if you take this plan , you will have good sheap like them . <\s>
<s> However , it always not exactly to follow the plan they made , so they sued each other . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , most of advertisments make products seem much better than they really are is the ture . <\s>
<s> The orgainzation , nike company and MC Donald are just the few example that I meation it . <\s>
<s> Advertisements are beter than products lots of time . <\s>
<s> Because an advertisement 's aims to sell the productwith best way . <\s>
<s> Therefore , products sometimes be different in advertisement . <\s>
<s> This is a strategy . <\s>
<s> This strategy has some reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , marketting plan . <\s>
<s> A product has a good marketing plan to sell . <\s>
<s> Therefore , a marketing plan has an effectively advertisement . <\s>
<s> Because , they like brother in business life . <\s>
<s> If you forget one of them , you do n't achieve this job . <\s>
<s> People choose products with that way . <\s>
<s> My interpretation of successful people is not just based in either try something new or take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However I agree with those people that believe that by doing new things , they may get a better chance and opportunity in life , if the case is that their reality is not good enough for themselves . <\s>
<s> I think that get new ideas , give a try to new experiences , let you open your mind to a very important thihgs such as tolerance , diversity and knowlodge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Along my short life , I been thinking that life is a beautiful moment , that let you choose . <\s>
<s> That each one of us take their own risk , even to let pass the good oportunities or even to take them , however not always take the risk is good and is the best choice . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe that if you do n't let go the things out , if you just close your life and you do n't look higher of what you have , life can become pretty plane . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I respect all of these people that rather being in the same place and doing the same work during all their lifes , than the ones that feel that learn and have a bigger knowledge doing something new , is part of grow and really enjoy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I would like to ask these people , how they preffer being who they are , and doing what they do , if they do n't know something else ? <\s>
<s> Here I am not talking about success , I am talking about happiness and according with my own thoughts and ideas , happiness connect success and success people is happy . <\s>
<s> People who had a success are believed that they are willing to venture and take chances even though they already know what is the thing that they can do the best . <\s>
<s> The reason why they make difference from any other ordinary people is <\s>
<s> I agree the statements . <\s>
<s> Most important thing for students is to understand exsiting knowledge . <\s>
<s> Students have to learn flameworks of exiting kwnoledge . <\s>
<s> I was a student of mathmatics and realized how important to understand concepts . <\s>
<s> There are many simple facts in mathematics but gathering facts didnt lead me to any ideas nor concepts . <\s>
<s> Especially students ususal do n't have ability to create idea or concepts , therfore just leaning facts dose n't make anything for the students So at first , to get ability to create new concepts nor ideas students heve to learn about what concepts is , how exititng concepts was created . <\s>
<s> Once students get ability to cerate concepts , it 's also important to learn facts . <\s>
<s> I know that I have to learn English harder . <\s>
<s> It 's good experience for me to take TOEFL because I have realized my English skill . <\s>
<s> This test makes me to want to study English . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I have take this test just because I want to no my English skill , in this meanings I can mesure my english skill before I recieve the score . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thanks . <\s>
<s> They are different kinds of people , some of them like to live their lives just the way they have and they are some other that love to continue improve their results , their goals , their lives . <\s>
<s> One example of this kind of people are the successful people , who one day had a dream and they follow and make it real . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this kind of people , some things can happend . <\s>
<s> One thing is you will know you tasks and skills so well that you could became a costum or a rutine and you can stay stock in the job , the ideas or the the proyect you are working . <\s>
<s> Also you can loose you profesional level because of that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another options is to try new things that breake the rutine or take risks that will improve your ideas day by day . <\s>
<s> For example if I 'm use to take the second avenue to go to my job and always get late , to be more success in the time that I arrive to my job I can try a new road to get to it . <\s>
<s> Another possibility is to evaluate periodical the process and traid different ways and then choose wich is the best . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks , because they are not affair of change the things , change the process for an options that will be better and at the end will give them the chance to continue with the successfull that they have . <\s>
<s> I agree this opinion . <\s>
<s> I have three reasons about this . <\s>
<s> First , the age of communities is growing up . <\s>
<s> There are usually many older people in the communities with enlonging the mean age . <\s>
<s> Older people have many witness , skills and cultures , so young people have to absorb it to heridate the new generation . <\s>
<s> Indeed Young people are difficult talk with older people because the interested thing are quites different . <\s>
<s> We have to get those things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , it is safty to protect our communities themselves . <\s>
<s> The ratio of damaging by the thives could decrese with power of protecting themselves . <\s>
<s> In fact , it is possible to decrese it by walking around the communities at night . <\s>
<s> We are be too careful to close at doors and windows as possible as we can , but thieves are often appears . <\s>
<s> It is necessary to prevent from invading thieves with communities powers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , humans live with groups . <\s>
<s> We cannot live alone . <\s>
<s> While young age , it is little opportunities to be helped by other people . <\s>
<s> If they need , they take a telepone some friends at long distance . <\s>
<s> They get not helps but opinions , we can put it off . <\s>
<s> Today there are more cars than twenty years ago . <\s>
<s> I agree with the following statement . <\s>
<s> Today there are more pollution because the people use the cars everyday so the environement is worst . <\s>
<s> In my opinion it is necessary to use the pubblic transport to improve the air , the pollution . <\s>
<s> Today more persons died a cause the cars it necessary to use the car with more attention . <\s>
<s> Today there are more kind of the car , to reserch in better models which offer more services and to answerd the customer-s needs . <\s>
<s> I think yes ... <\s>
<s> the young people enjoy life more than older people do for examples : the young people can go to a football match everyday and play as long as he wants to if he is healthy sure .. <\s>
<s> but the old man cant go everyday maybe once in a week cauze he is too old and he cant run ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And i think is the old man is busy with wriseng hes child and be a good father like puting hes child in the most famous school and that ofcourse need money soo he will always try to get the best job to get money for hes child and hes home , and that ofcourse dont leave time to hem to enjoy hes life and see the beautifull things in it .. <\s>
<s> except the weekend and maybe at the week end he will be tired from hes work and he will sleep and lay-down for whole day .. <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But there are some young people who enjoyed there time by drugs and drinking and that ofcourse is not an enjoying time for us ... <\s>
<s> and i think that is the old people who spend there time at work or anything else are more enjoying from them that in my opinion ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And i think is the young people will try to do everything new in their life otherwise the old man had finish doing hes new thing when he was a young man and ofcourse he will be borred from everythinig .. <\s>
<s> But i want to say that not every young man is enjoying hes life more than the old man do ... <\s>
<s> I would like to begin my essay with Prof. Abert Einstein ' s telling . <\s>
<s> He had said that understanding of a problem is the half of the solving . <\s>
<s> We can not analyze concepts and ideas without not knowing what we have on our hand . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I think to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A greater number of people , on the world , are now judging each other without understanding each other 's ideas and ideologies . <\s>
<s> And they learn facts without an infrastructural information . <\s>
<s> This rival makes them merciless . <\s>
<s> Because they do n't know how they should react . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For instance , we assume a man who helps poor people without judging them getting them dressed , clear and satiated and assume his neighbour has n't any idea what the man makes . <\s>
<s> Our man accept his home all kinds of people olders , kids , women and men . <\s>
<s> If firstly , his neighbour doesn ' t understand his ideas and then call police to learn the fact , an inappropriate event occurs . <\s>
<s> But firstly , if he understands his idea . <\s>
<s> No problems occur . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As our knowledge grows regarding various diseases , we become better equipped with sense . <\s>
<s> I agree . <\s>
<s> I think resently young people contact with thier communituies . <\s>
<s> For example they do n't greet with people . <\s>
<s> There is n't comunication . <\s>
<s> and they think contact of communities is boreing . <\s>
<s> but , comunication with communities is very important . <\s>
<s> Becouse , This defend communities 's sefty . <\s>
<s> Resently , more and more commits incresing . <\s>
<s> expecially , comunication is effectiv for robber . <\s>
<s> If communities 's contact hard , robber can n't aim at this city . <\s>
<s> In This way , comunities 's contact make sefty . <\s>
<s> Next , If young peppe contribute their communities , this city improve . <\s>
<s> young people have great power to change commuities . <\s>
<s> For example , Using this power effectivilly , clean up this city . <\s>
<s> confatabule city enable to assemble people , so this city improve . <\s>
<s> and If people increse , commance deveroping . <\s>
<s> Shops and departments increse too . <\s>
<s> young people give time to helping their communitise <\s>
<s> young people enjoy life more than older people do becuase young people is whealthy , fast , dyanamic and etc where as people of older age have illiness , or with body pain or suffering from any diease so young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> I am japanese and I grew up in japan . <\s>
<s> so I have japanese culture . <\s>
<s> when I went to over sea , I was able to learn about different culture . <\s>
<s> and I had enjoyed studying about that . <\s>
<s> and I thought If I come here and stay to study English , I can enjoy my American life . <\s>
<s> but actueary , I think that American culture is rude . <\s>
<s> because , for example , American macine always has broken very soon . <\s>
<s> last month I bought a new motercycle and old car from my friend to go to school . <\s>
<s> but now my motercycle and car has broken soon . <\s>
<s> and take repair . <\s>
<s> but has broken again . <\s>
<s> in japan . <\s>
<s> japanese is very polite . <\s>
<s> so the macine which made in japan is very good and not have broken soon If we buy new one . <\s>
<s> I think japanese culture is too polite by American people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> but I can not understand yet that have broken soon . <\s>
<s> I think which made in JAPAN is very good . <\s>
<s> on the other hand . <\s>
<s> I have to understand about american culture if I continure staying here . <\s>
<s> when I can understand about american culture , I may enjoy the american life . <\s>
<s> I hope that come soon this thing . <\s>

<s> I 'm agree with the following statement : most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are . <\s>
<s> We can separe two kinds of advertisements : those direct to products , and those direct to persons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are many possibility to increase the apparence of anything or anyone . <\s>
<s> Teelling about the advertisements that make products much better than they really are , we can give a lots of examples : colorants in foods , pesticides in vegetable or fruits , etc . <\s>
<s> Many people think that a beautiful products is better than a unlikely product . <\s>
<s> It is n't true . <\s>
<s> In fact the produces use the advertisements for sell a product than cannot be sell for its apparence ; but this not means that the produtc is good . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is an other type of advertisements . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , in fact , it is widesprerad the use of the chilurgie plastic for seem much beatiful or young whose the person really is . <\s>
<s> Other way for seem better is the cosmetic . <\s>
<s> Each way , however , change the really apperence of the people and bring other people than are less beautiful to feells bad . <\s>
<s> our school system offers every pupil , either the person is not very smart or the person is intelligent , a graduation . <\s>
<s> so the schools at a lower level teach the pupils only the facts about a fiel or a problem . <\s>
<s> unlike the schools like universities which explain the problem and discuss it . <\s>
<s> now it is the question if it is more important to learn fact or to understand the idea and the concepts . <\s>
<s> I agree that is indeed very important to understand subjects which I get teached . <\s>
<s> One reason for that is that if somebody understand the them and is confirm about the problem or disabilities of that it is much probable to find a solution for a problem which could contain the idea . <\s>
<s> besides the learning of facts is not very usefull because if somebody do not repeats them after a certain time you are able to forget them . <\s>
<s> unlike to fact if somebody understands a concept . <\s>
<s> On this way it is possible to create a fictiv chain on which you can set to logical elements together . <\s>
<s> so that will be a much effective way to remember a idea and the problems tied to it . <\s>
<s> further if a student learns only the facts and does n't get teached about the whole concept there is the danger that the student does't understand the idea and later the person for what the facts are necessery . <\s>
<s> however the guarantee for a student which compleetly gets the point of the subject is that the person is able to talk free about it in a clearly way and that is only guaranted by getting the idea of the t <\s>
<s> i think its depened . <\s>
<s> first im going to talk about the young people . <\s>
<s> some of the young people are enjoing there life in many different ways and they do that by doing alot of things for example they travilling every wear and by going with there friends to the malls and to the cinema and alot of different places . <\s>
<s> but some of thim they are not enjoying thier life because of some reasons such as they dont have enough money to travell for example . <\s>
<s> or they works to support thier poor family . <\s>
<s> so that theirs young people that not enjoying thier life . <\s>
<s> and the sacend thing are the old people some of thiem are enjoing thier life in diffrerent ways . <\s>
<s> i have one example about my friend 's father . <\s>
<s> he is old and every year he have to travell even if he dont have enough mony he travell for one week and then he retern back and all that just for entertenment . <\s>
<s> but his sun 4 years he didnt travell . <\s>
<s> so it 's depend on person 's setewation . <\s>
<s> because some of the old people they dont enjoy thier life because they are very old so they care about thim selves more than thier enjoinment . <\s>
<s> I agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> today car is cheaper than before , so more people can buy it . <\s>
<s> but enjoy is a little on the earth . <\s>
<s> ti is really fewer than before . <\s>
<s> and it is very dierty for the earth . <\s>
<s> one of the important duties that must the person do it in his life is helping his communities . <\s>
<s> the person must take care of his parents all the time , especially when thy get old . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the person should look after his parents because they were looking after him when he was small . <\s>
<s> the parents loves there kids what ever they do , so we must protect this ower families and do what ever we should do to keep them happy all the time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> nowadays , most people are busy lookig after ther work and they forget about ther families . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> in conclousin , i think we should be close from oure families to make shour that they are comfortable all the time . <\s>
<s> In my opnion , this statement is true . <\s>
<s> It is because most young people spend their time not helping their communities but theirselves . <\s>
<s> For example , some people have to work for their life , other people have to study for passing the school-entrance-test . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> You may think , however , many people belong to clube or volunter-activity . <\s>
<s> Of couse , some people take part in some activities , but the number of them is decresing than the number of them in old years . <\s>
<s> This fact shows us that young people today do not give much time to participate activities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , it is true that young people today do not give much time to helping their communities than young people did at the old day ! <\s>
<s> I am agree . <\s>
<s> becouse in twenty years is so long time . <\s>
<s> and in this case is cars . <\s>
<s> actually we havee to use car every day . <\s>
<s> and righyht now . <\s>
<s> car is a nesesaally . <\s>
<s> I cannot drive a car but if my mam and dad dose not have a car ... <\s>
<s> I cannot imagine . <\s>
<s> i think so hard to moveing . <\s>
<s> but now . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that advertisement make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Advertisement can make products look good in following three ways ; First of all , avdertisement is the perfect method to show products great . <\s>
<s> Well , I disagree with the statement that says `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . <\s>
<s> The reason for that , is I think facts are the basic of ideas . <\s>
<s> So , how can an idae or a concept come before the fact . <\s>
<s> Consquantally , the we leran the basic which is the fact , then we propose an idea . <\s>
<s> So , if a students recivied an idea or a concept without having the solid basics , he wil not be able to make his decision about it . <\s>
<s> Therefor , he will not have the apportinuty to discouss the concept . <\s>
<s> Clearly , the logical way to learn is facts then concepts . <\s>
<s> So , we teach students the basics and the facts , and gradually try to involve some ideas and concepts into their material . <\s>
<s> In this way , they will learn how accepet all the opinions and then make their own decision . <\s>
<s> Also , they will try to interfere from the facts then try to propose their explaination and support it with evidences . <\s>
<s> An example for my choise if Geology calss . <\s>
<s> If we taught a student that caves are formed in a certain way , he will memorize it without conventition . <\s>
<s> In other hand if we taught him about caves from different areas . <\s>
<s> They are an extent area but if he got some information about kinds of caves and how it formed , he will be convinted about what he learns . <\s>
<s> I agree with this the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s> I have two reasons to suppot my opinion . <\s>
<s> First of all , the thing refluences our diary life because we think that it is natural that our life become more convenient once a year . <\s>
<s> In this society , we use many convenient products . <\s>
<s> Now we have bad idea that useless we can use some products sush as electronic products and computer comfortablely , we do not want to use these products . <\s>
<s> It is said that the way of thinking developed the following statement . <\s>
<s> For example , in my house this idea is spreading because my parents try to buy new products seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s> Actually they bought new ovan a few month ago . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Next , as many people require new products next to next , the company try to invent the more developing products . <\s>
<s> The efffect plays a important role in Japan economic . <\s>
<s> Becasue if many companies stop to invent products , Japan will suffer a big problem that influences economic , society , and so on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I really agree with the following statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Most advertisement do not make products , our life cannot keep well , and Japan will be at a loss . <\s>
<s> This is important thing . <\s>
<s> I do not agree most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> First , TV , NEWPAPER , INTERNET and so on , more and more come into our life , so we can get a lot of advertisments everyday . <\s>
<s> In the day life , we have to buy lots things , the same thing we have so many chance , which one is better for use , which one price is better , we can not look for every store , so the advertisments give us the information . '' <\s>
<s> OH , this one is good , has a lot of function , we shall buy this one `` We will say that after saw the advertisement . <\s>
<s> But , if the real products is not better as advertisment , we spend time and monay , then we buy the product is not we want , what will happend next ? <\s>
<s> We do not trust advertisements anymore . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , sometime , we really need the product , it is most importent to us , we bought the one after study a lot of advertisments , but you got the one was not you wanted . <\s>
<s> If you bought it at store , you can change or return it at once , but you bought it via internet , what you can do ? <\s>
<s> It is mean you lost a chance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , that publisher or producter give people advertisements are not real products . <\s>
<s> People are not trust you again , you will lose the market . <\s>
<s> So I do not agree that piont . <\s>
<s> This is an important aspect of today time . <\s>
<s> This products rathen are not much better , but today is not important the really character of the product , but only the money and the client not rappresented the important actor in this process . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every day any people buy same products that is not rappresented the your necessity , but is only important buy any product . <\s>
<s> To explain this argoment in my nation , at the television , there is an program that discuss of the problem rappresented by this . <\s>
<s> More people go to this program television to talk about your problem , that is very radicate in my nation . <\s>
<s> The modern society rappresented the perfect ambient to influenced the minds of all the person . <\s>
<s> In my self is present the reasons of this statement , that is one of the problem of the life . <\s>
<s> But not all the people and the time is in accord with this problem , because any time the person is too according with the make products . <\s>
<s> Thus I agree with this statement , because this event is present in my life every day , and rappresented the problem with I do fighting . <\s>
<s> But to explain all the aspect about this argoment is very inportant to illustre any examples . <\s>
<s> The television programs that every day introduce in the minds more argoment , news and other problem , or breaking news , is the first actor in this process . <\s>
<s> This opinion rappresented my self in my life , because for me the life of all the people is not possible to influence by the activity of any person . <\s>
<s> The society lose the propriety when this problem will rappresent the must argoment of the talk and the life of the people , because as very difficult live at a time with this argoment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The my request is that the new politics discuss about this problem . <\s>
<s> I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> The academic subjects are very important to every body and we need to understand many academic subjects and try to apply it in our life to have good knowledge . <\s>
<s> There are many academic subjects like nutrition and food sciences , chemistry , medicine , biology , pharmacology , histology and management which must be read about it and study it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The cademic subjects will help us to understand our life and promote us to develop our life styles to the best way . <\s>
<s> We have good chance in this time to reach many academic subjects by internet or library or any academic centres in the world ( universities or colleges ) . <\s>
<s> If we take different academic subjects in this time we can focus on specific subject to be an expert in that subject and to take more experince . <\s>
<s> Now , the world have fast changes which need different sciences to deal with it . <\s>
<s> We need many people to take specific academic subjects to solve our problems in our life . <\s>
<s> We need specific academic centres in many sciences . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , Each person must be take many academic subjects and try to specified in specific subject . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> I think that a large amount of advertisement is wrong , false . <\s>
<s> But people are fascinated by this idea of excellence . <\s>
<s> And this modern society prefers to believe to an advertisement than an idea of its mind . <\s>
<s> The advertisements tell us that every thing is good , nice , clever and honest . <\s>
<s> But we must thing and try things using our mind . <\s>
<s> When we buy something we must buy it if we need it . <\s>
<s> But we often do it because the newspaper , or the radio , or the TV tells us to buy something . <\s>
<s> At Christmas million of mothers and fathers buy stupid and bad toys for their children because the advertisements have modified their ideas . <\s>
<s> I do n't know which is the reason of this behavior and I believe that ther <\s>
<s> It is thought that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> I agree with this idea . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> DespiteIf students study hard , they cannot memorize a long time ; if students learn just facts , they will not memorize what they learned . <\s>
<s> When a students read a book about their studies , if the students just read all text with out understanding , the students cannot explain how was the book is . <\s>
<s> If a student have excellent memorizing ability , a student can remember everything without understanding ; not only is it hard for students to have , but also every people cannot do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To understand ideas and concepts are provide students with an opportunity to use information atpprociately that they lened in studies . <\s>
<s> Only students learn facts , they can use information . <\s>
<s> But without understanding has limit to use . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students learn more easily if they undertand ideas and conceots then if they learn only facts . <\s>
<s> When a students learn a vocabulary , A which way is more easy to use and memorize ? <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things and take the risks rather than only doing what they learn already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> Is it true ! <\s>
<s> Lets take it from the beginning of a baby just burn . <\s>
<s> At the first of his life he wants to touch everything around , even it 's hot . <\s>
<s> He does n't know , but he take the chances to try and learn what can this thing reply to him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If we look to the small people we know what is inside the big people . <\s>
<s> They would to take the chances to learn everything . <\s>
<s> So they feel the successful feeling . <\s>
<s> They touch the happyness in winning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> No person can learn if he afraid the thing . <\s>
<s> How experiance get to his mind if he stop searching and keep working on what he only knew . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lets talk about my self . <\s>
<s> I 'm at marraige age right now . <\s>
<s> So my feeling is to experiance the word marraige . <\s>
<s> I know what does it mean , but I do not feel what it is mean . <\s>
<s> I have to go throw so I can feel the new experiance . <\s>
<s> Should has a lettle fair , but we need to win the life game . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example I new is a rich man . <\s>
<s> How did he become a rich ! <\s>
<s> Money does not come from the sky . <\s>
<s> By the blessing of GOD , he take the risk to try to feel how to be a rich by giving all the money he has and took some of his friends . <\s>
<s> He Intered a new thing . <\s>
<s> He success with paying back the many he owns to his friends . <\s>
<s> Also reaching the level of rich people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> How is the pilots learn to fly . <\s>
<s> He took the risk and grabe the yok to control the plane even he know the he is doing something denguras . <\s>
<s> To lear a successful we sould take the risk and do a new thing we may learn from the first , the second or the third . <\s>
<s> But invintially we learn . <\s>
<s> It is more importan for students to learn facts because would be better for the students to understand and it also would be more easy to remenber , I not agree with this for meny reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , is more easy for the studens remaid the facts or the esperience that they have because they have being in . <\s>
<s> Also they would never forgent that . <\s>
<s> For example , When I was in scholl I remenbered tha t I laked to go to the la boratoty to do some experiments and I felt that I never would forget that because l lived le experince . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , Is more important for the studets stay in the facs because they can Also show some posibles solutions about whatever problems that the would have and lear abaut this experience , Third , when the studens are in facts of some event , it is more exacted for then because they are living the experience . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the studets would be more interested in the subject that they are coursing . <\s>
<s> Also they would be better and work successfully . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , For all these reasons I agree whit is more important for the students lear facts than learn abao the ideas and conceps . <\s>
<s> I believe that concepts and facts are pretty related each other , so both of them are necessary during the student 's learning process . <\s>
<s> In many cases , concepts are the result or the inferences made on studies over facts , like for example pyshics law of gravitation that could be inferred after years of observations on planet movements , or demand and offerts law , that summarizes the behaviors of the buyers and factorys seeing for many years . <\s>
<s> So , to get a full comprenhension of a concept , it is neccessary to review and study the facts that are involve with the concept , and then try to undestand or infered what the concept is summarizing patters or similar behaviors that you found . <\s>
<s> Many professor and students just like to take a bounch of facts and review it , but this kind of learning approach is meanless , because you use facts only as supportative information , so you can really get a full understanding of what the facts are showing or what are happening . <\s>
<s> For others is more likely the approach of trying just to understand de concept without reviewing or analysing the facts , making very difficult to get a full understand of the concept and even making very difficult to applied it in real situations . <\s>
<s> For my the perfect convination of learning from the facts and undertanding the concept , is the best path to a succeful learning process . <\s>
<s> some people said that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to help thier communities , in my opinion i think young people are more helpful for the community , and they are trying hard to sitisfy the community , but the community never belive in the young people , becuase thay still young and they do n't have enough expirence in life , but i think if you give the young people their chanse to show you what they can do , no one help the young people to improve their selfies and got more expireance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> there is alot of young people who are waiting for a job to help the community , they are a good people they look for the better thing for their community but no one give them the chanse to do it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> in my opinion the goverment and the high athority people should trasit the young people and try to help them in ther life , if these guys did n't help them who will , that 's why we all sould trasit the young people , and they are the future of the country , the will countrol the country some day , that 's why we should teach theme how they have to do this job , and it should be in the right way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> at the end i just want to say that young people diserve more than that , and they are the future of our country , so we have to belive in them , and try to help them , and lead them to the right way , to countrol the country in the best way , and the country will rais up couse of them , so we have to trasit thes young people . <\s>
<s> What is better : <\s>
<s> If i know something of all i can think a better and different solution for a problem and mix some different ones that in the most of the cases si better than using always the same solution , well is also true that if you are specialized in one tipe of subject he can make a better and more efficent solution for what is specialized but if the problem go out his knowledge you could have much problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having one of some specific subject in wich you are interested and studings that also by yourself can meke a better preparetion and bring you to do a work you like to do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the accademic contest is also better have a broad konowledge due in the accademy you have someone who explain you the things so you colud understend things that only reading one book never explain , is also true that there are certein argoments for what every people is not predisposed , in that cases , well , i thing is better avoid these subjects , yes is not the best solution but i hate break my head over a thing that i never understend , and i prefer dedicate that time to other acticities hows give me a soddisfaction . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It also better know somthing of all in the everiday life for a better response to the problem that occurs and also for giving a better advice and answer to friend . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion i think that is better know many subjects than specialize in only but having some specific and personal knowledge can identify you from a pool of applicant for a job or in some ather palces . <\s>
<s> I disagree with this idea . <\s>
<s> in order to make a huge success , people do not need to create new ways every time when they discover problems . <\s>
<s> by doing that , they are easily lost their trail and are in danger of new tisks . <\s>
<s> historically , the methods and discovery ended up with great success , most of them are based on old and traditional ideas . <\s>
<s> For example , Tomas Edison invited the tellphone as the same time an other scientists did , and he could not become the inviter of the tellphone because he turn out his work three hours leter than the other scientists . <\s>
<s> HOwever , he advanse his tellphone and solve the many problems the tell phone had . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> To make the point clearer , I have taken `` their communities '' as their local communities where they live . <\s>
<s> I do not know how many young people attend their local community events or even strictly obey rules in their local community . <\s>
<s> Examples are everywhere . <\s>
<s> One of the reasons would be that such behavior to help their local communities needs to be learned some way or another , but not learned . <\s>
<s> If young people lived with their parents or there were neighbors who had known them long time , they could learn it . <\s>
<s> If young people lived in the same place where they grew up , they would undestand naturally how to behave . <\s>
<s> But young people nowadays tend to live alone or only with their spouses and far from their hometowns . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that since nowadays almost all the every day life is supported by business undertakings , people can live without helping their communities by themselves . <\s>
<s> I both agree and disgree with those two statemant . <\s>
<s> from my prepactive I thik what all matter is your comfor what ever you feel goood about you choose . <\s>
<s> Basd on my experiance I traveled to many countriesaroud the wide world . <\s>
<s> Howevr I just travel once with a group led by a tour guide , and I find it very intersting I have been to places that I have never been before even thought that I visit the contry before . <\s>
<s> the group led by a tour guide can save time and money . <\s>

<s> Having a group led is very halpfull , becouse you get to see places without spending any affert or going around in cricles . <\s>
<s> It is very intresting becouse before you travel to the country , the group giude has has seted the shcudual . <\s>
<s> Even it is chepper to travel with a group becouse evry thing is going by a group not indivaualy . <\s>
<s> when you travel by you self you are going to spend lots of money if you traveled by your self , or even straggle to find good plaecs to spend in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The disadvanteges of the group guide you cant haveprivecy . <\s>
<s> let say tat you are going in honey moon you are not going to choose a group guide . <\s>
<s> you might not get along with the group . <\s>
<s> one tiny disadvatage of the grop guide is some times they the scagual a plan and you might have fun , or you dont like the place to be exact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What I do recommend is if you have not tried the the group travel you got to try it even thought disagvantges but it 's worth it . <\s>
<s> the best two advandeges is you are going to save money and time . <\s>
<s> I agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> There are 3 reasons I agree . <\s>
<s> First , I can get information from a tour guide or group members . <\s>
<s> Last summer , I visited to Okinawa in a tour group . <\s>
<s> It is first time for me to Okinawa . <\s>
<s> I have few information . <\s>
<s> However , in group tour it is OK , because tour guide has so much information . <\s>
<s> To follow the guide , I can really enjoy the travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Next , I can go to the place which not famouse , but very nice . <\s>
<s> There is a good place which we can not know from the guid book . <\s>
<s> The tour guide tell us that information . <\s>
<s> For example , good restaulant , good suvenia shop , and good shight seeing place so on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , I can travel safety . <\s>
<s> If we face some happning , I can ask the guide to help . <\s>
<s> They have to help us to contrast . <\s>
<s> Thesedays , Japanese often aim from robber in other country . <\s>
<s> Moreover , when I face the trafic accident or dissester , for example earthquipe , My familiy get information imidietlly from the tour company . <\s>
<s> I agree that most advertisements made products seem much better than they realy are for many reasons . <\s>
<s> First , they made a style that acceptable from customurs by puting thier products in a good shap to attract people to buy it . <\s>
<s> For example , I will buy any product if it is not having a good shape . <\s>
<s> Also , the must know what people love in thier product and do that so they can write that thier product contain some materials which dose n't exist . <\s>
<s> For instance , I love natural materials in my product not chemical one so they write on thier product that it contains only natural product and that is not true . <\s>
<s> Besids , most advertisements love to gain much money even if thier product would n't allow them to . <\s>
<s> They get a cheap material for thier product and says it had good ones to gain more money . <\s>
<s> For example , I used to buy a product for my child and suddenly he fall illness so the doctor do not allow me to this product for him again . <\s>
<s> In sum every things know a day is not as good as it appears . <\s>
<s> Some people in the world , may be in poor countries dislike to understand ideas and concepts , but they prefer to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do n't agree with this statement , because the real sense of the life is in the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is more important for a fisher understand how find a fish , or it is more important for he swim in the rivers or sea and became to know how is phylosophy of fish , I think the fisher should be firts a good swimer , and he only will obtain good results in his work with practice , with facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But it is also important understand ideas of how working the things , Because if We do not study first the world can not know the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , the same fisher will obtain best results in his work , if He first will study how is the behavior of the fishes , in Which kind of water , the fishes grown faster . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other example , The farmers cultivated a lot of years ago , without our tecnology and knowlodge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> How Did They cultivate it ? <\s>
<s> There is a only answer , with facts , with practice . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , If the farmers cultivated with more ideas , with more knowledge , theirs results will be best . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> How did Child learn to speak ? <\s>
<s> He do not learn with to understand ideas and concepts , he learn with facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the progress countries , there are some people thinking that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclussion , it is more importand for students learn facts , practice for learn , because this can use for them in their countries . <\s>
<s> I often think many times about my Future I will have to work hard about that . <\s>
<s> I would like to talk about my self . <\s>
<s> I was born in a small village in Saudi Arabia . <\s>
<s> and all my family is so poor familly , when I was a small childern I thought How can I help my parents and I plane to do two things these thinks the firestthinks I am going to complet my high education in The United State . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> second thinks I have to do I will work in a big company in Saudi Arabia <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firest think I have to do I will complet my majar in Mechanical Engineering In best University in America , Because with a high education only I can help my poor family , I have spent alot of time to study , my deram of completing my PHD for same major here in America . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second thinks I prefer to do I will could find a good jop in a big oil company in my country , Becaues My country the biggest country fo export oil in around the world . <\s>
<s> and When I find jop in this company . <\s>
<s> I will have a good money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I will try work succesfful To try many a good thinks with many risks However , With a high education , and a good jop I will help my family . <\s>
<s> These my situation I want explaine with reason every person must try do many things with risks to take any thinks he or she dreams to do it . <\s>
<s> I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Many people can think that older people can enjoy more , but I agree for the following statement . <\s>
<s> Many people said that students should always study hard . <\s>
<s> I think that 's wright , but not always . <\s>
<s> When you are young , you can learn more various things that when you grow up , but I think you also enjoy your life when you are young . <\s>
<s> Students are attending classes in school everyday . <\s>
<s> And there are many friends in school . <\s>
<s> It is very important to study , and get much knowledge from your teacher , but in my opinion , I think to get close and communicate with their frieds are more important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some older people said `` I want to be a student '' . <\s>
<s> First I heard that , I thoght it is very funny . <\s>
<s> I do n't know why they want to be a student . <\s>
<s> But I recognize that student can more enjoy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many students meet and hang out together . <\s>
<s> I really like that . <\s>
<s> When I play with my friends , I can do what I want . <\s>
<s> I think enjoy life is doing something what I want . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When you grow up , it 's hard to do whatever you want . <\s>
<s> Because you have your family . <\s>
<s> So I think young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> I agree with the follwing statement that said `` most adertisment make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Most of these advertisement decorates the producs and make it the best product , even when it is not true . <\s>
<s> Bcause it will give penifit for the company that makes the adevetisment and the company that has the products <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In our life , when we watch TV , we see alot of advertisment that how they gain alot of money . <\s>
<s> For example , In arabian shows especially in ramadhan ( that special months in arabian celander that people fasting during that month ) you see alot of shows that attract people so the company for advertisment takes this chance to insert their advertising durin these shows . <\s>
<s> As a result of thic concept , they can gain alot of money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , most new products when they want to be noticable or famous they tent to the advrtisment to succeede the product . <\s>
<s> not only to succeede the product , some company that find that people do not intersted in their product use advetising for that product , they tend to this way to be do not losing their products . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conlousion , this statment `` most advertisment make prouducts seem much better than they really are '' is true . <\s>
<s> that alot of people use advertisment to be foumous and every one know it and also all people love the money and like to gain alot of money . <\s>
<s> usaully my parent told me that the money and being foumous are the decoration of our life . <\s>
<s> At this time we are free to buy and choise the best products in the market , i want to mention difrerents products like , food , cleaners products , clothes and also medicine or cigarrets . <\s>
<s> The diversity of products is growing more each day . <\s>
<s> I want to talk about nocive or bad products like alcohol , hair spray and cigarrets . <\s>
<s> I would like to mention 3 points of view about advertisements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , people do not care about the advertisements even if is mentioned in the products they never read . <\s>
<s> Second , The goverment has to be more strict for to prove the products . <\s>
<s> Tird , in this point i want to mention not the responsability of the customer if not of the companies who offer the products , they should write in bigger advertisements . <\s>
<s> I think people must be think about the concecuences in a future and not just for their healt , aslo must concider for their family and the enviroment who is important for everybody . <\s>
<s> In other way Goverment is a very important part for admit or to leave the companies to sell products who destroy people or the enviroment . <\s>
<s> yes i do . <\s>
<s> in my opinion i thing that the best way to travel is alone , not in goup , i 'll tell why . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> first if you era in a travel group you heve tod follow the guide and the rest of the group , that indicate so you do n't have the time to enjoy the things that like you , the pictures are faster , quickly and other things that happen usually . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> a travel group led by a guide tour could be not exited , becouse all the information is short and in mant cases are incorrec . <\s>
<s> you supossed taht the guide knows everything , buy in some cases or some places do n't have the education or not are prepared . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> i am not saying that all is bad , it have ome point on its side , you can ask , and always you will find a perfect anwer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> if i travel alone i can enjoy every thing that interes me. personally i am an architec , i like watch carfully the enviroment , like buildings , plazas , streets , houses and nature , and for those reasons i thing i cant enjoy a group tour . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> on the other hand is more interesting if you construc your kwonlegemet because it will for ever , you can get imidiatly reference of places or buildings , and one important part i cant take pictures like i want . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> i prefer take my time and not make any plan of the things that i going to . <\s>
<s> thats not the sense of a travel. a travel is to get relax , drink some coffe in a little coffe shop , walk through the cities , visit some historical places , visit museums and why not meet people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally i wish i cant tavel by arond the word aolne and have many pictures and many histories to teel you when i came back . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas understanding ideas are very nessary for students to answer and connect their ideas with their life . <\s>
<s> It.s good for students read more than one books to give their conclosion or what they understant and all students must have own opinion to be differ and be uniqe to ather students . <\s>
<s> If we want to know who are understand from the students we can ask them about some informaion belong to the subject . <\s>
<s> There are many ways to make the students understand such as : you can put some picture in your subject , you can put films or you can take some news from newspapers . <\s>
<s> From began the study if the teacher give wrigh information and what , s the students need after that the student will be good and walk in their life better than who don , t understand very well . <\s>
<s> If the students don , t know or don , t understand about something there are some solution to do like : they can ask their teacher or maybe they can seek or go to the internet it have alarge benifit informaion about any thing you want . <\s>
<s> Understanding any thing is good because it give them the facts and how to learn it and if it , s true or not and they can connect and contrac with more than one thing and take the example from life or friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Because theis i agee that is under stand idea is very important . <\s>
<s> iam dis agreeing with the statement that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> the students more eager to learn through the experimenting the facts than the learning by understanding the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> because understanding facts is just theoritical . <\s>
<s> learning facts is the practical . <\s>
<s> so , i prefer experimenting than theoritical explanation . <\s>
<s> when the student told by theoritically he may not understand . <\s>
<s> where as if he showed practically surely he will understand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> for eg ; fact is water flows from height to the lower place . <\s>
<s> if the teacher told him orally he may understand or not understand . <\s>
<s> but if he showed the water flow once he wo n't forget . <\s>
<s> so that fact should be proved practically then only every one understands . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> ideas and concepts are told by some one . <\s>
<s> the learn facts are by the student his own by in the learning process . <\s>
<s> ideas and concepts are helpful in the academic wise . <\s>
<s> the learn concepts are useful in leading life comfortably . <\s>
<s> facts and concepts of all are not practicable . <\s>
<s> so that along with the facts and concepts the learning facts are got equal importance . <\s>
<s> initially student will understand the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> as age grows he learns through the learning facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> for eg ; in younger age what teacher tells in the class that student will grasp . <\s>
<s> as he grow up he will like to impliment the facts by his own . <\s>
<s> he starts think by his own . <\s>
<s> so learning facts got the importance in application of own ideas . <\s>
<s> In this competitive world , lots of company are rised and lots of company are disappeared . <\s>
<s> Some company , in order to make a great amout of profit , use unethical way to produce their products . <\s>
<s> I really agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Some examples will be showed in my essay below to prove how much i agree about the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Almost every day i will watch TV show and follow by a huge number of advertising which are shampoo , conditioner , bank , restrant and more . <\s>
<s> The one i think most attractive is `` VS '' , which company made hair shampoo and conditioner in Britain . <\s>
<s> In this advertising , every model 's hair will looks very shinny , soft and healthy . <\s>
<s> I tried one set of this production , after i used them it was good , my hair are soft but not shinny . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another advrtising i want talking about is restrant . <\s>
<s> Everytime i saw the advertising about the food that Drogen Restrant made was nice and delicious . <\s>
<s> Their pics showing their food in the nice color . <\s>
<s> And the restrant looks in the pic are big and nice . <\s>
<s> But after i tried this restrant , i can say i do not want try again . <\s>
<s> The food are aweful and restrant are small .. <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion , company now used all their ablities and incomes on their advertisings how to attract more customers . <\s>
<s> i agree whit the idea thet in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> and now i go to explain may reagion about this question . <\s>
<s> if we look the respons about pollution we can see that , for exaple , ten years old , the pollution wos les to compare !!! <\s>
<s> if the situation remain inalterated i think that the cars will are fewer . <\s>
<s> another point thet we can take are the news borns .. <\s>
<s> mor peples mor cars . <\s>
<s> another problem about is the job , one person , usually , have a job so far away . <\s>
<s> i think thet if the pubblic transport will be mor fluently and quikly i suppose thet the cars will stay at the garage . <\s>
<s> For many years , discorery fascinating things have ever excited humans . <\s>
<s> So , we owe such the discorey of the electricy and the ligth , to ability , the motivation and the courage to those persons who have had the inspiration to explore the new fields . <\s>
<s> That is why , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today , without the explorer 's spirit of Christopher Colombus , the USA will not be dicovered . <\s>
<s> Today again , without the inspiration of the searcher LOUIS PASTOR , the humanity would not profit of plenty of vaccines . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Morever , without the genius spirit of BILL GATE , what will the industry of the computer and mainly the internet will become . <\s>
<s> All these obviuos examples to support the action to undertake the risk to do something if more profitable instead of the one that advice use to risk <\s>
<s> That the point is young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities These is the computer generations . <\s>
<s> Now a days the people are very busy and have no time to help their communities . <\s>
<s> Today people are became bussiness mind and the young people seeing there own . <\s>
<s> By helping the communities very good habit , by helping the communities we become a good for all . <\s>
<s> By helping the communities we can also learn something . <\s>
<s> and any help we want then they also help us . <\s>
<s> The young people have much budden in studies or in job the people also have less time to think other persons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now a days the people have no time to think others . <\s>
<s> The young people are busy there studies and jobs . <\s>
<s> Now a days they have the compitition each and every were not in helping their communities The not have time to enjoy themself also . <\s>
<s> From childwood they have no time the young people also messing alot of enjoyment . <\s>
<s> but in that time also they helping to their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion that the young people was given time to helping communities . <\s>
<s> some people think young people do not tink other people other are disagree that opinion . <\s>
<s> however , in my opinion i think young people help others who realated them in community . <\s>
<s> i also have three specific reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the first , young person is more socialable than older person . <\s>
<s> always give and take in social that exist various kinds of person . <\s>
<s> somebody who no give ans just take can not live within communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> sometimes young aged person looks like not spending enough time to help other communities becouse they act small in various groups . <\s>
<s> totally spending time is same or more than olders the second , they help others at invisable parts . <\s>
<s> older person help others phisically . <\s>
<s> noways , technology is so devepoled so if i want help others on internet or phone . <\s>
<s> i also help old person who live in different cities sending a letter for reduce their loneiness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the third , young person think helping others is esseencial . <\s>
<s> if someone ready their future themselves , they have to help others like or dis like . <\s>
<s> almost callage or university even job area require time for voluntary work . <\s>
<s> as far as I 'm concerned , It is better way to specialize in one specific subjuct . <\s>
<s> While it is true that having broad knowlecge of many academic subject is necessary for graduation , specific subject plays a great role after graduation . <\s>
<s> the rationale bebind this is to get a jop as well as to be a member of world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , gaining a jop is getting harder and harder . <\s>
<s> it is also true that if one wants to obtain the similar work with the person who graduate high school . <\s>
<s> one do not need to learn specific subject . <\s>
<s> In other words , It is impossible to imagine the professional jop without taking some specific courses in university . <\s>
<s> In my country , specific lectures allow peolple to survive at their workplace . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , our society is getting more specific and more professional . <\s>
<s> Even in this situation , If one does not have any professional knowledge , he or she should send their resume into a supermaket or laundry stroe . <\s>
<s> these days the world is changing dramatically , therefore , you have to have something different <\s>
<s> I agree with only successful people only . <\s>
<s> The successful people only making new things . <\s>
<s> For example Ainsteen developing three hundred items thats why the only successful people try to developing the new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do not agree with the entire sentence . <\s>
<s> Only i am agree with the `` successful people '' . <\s>
<s> They only describing the new things . <\s>
<s> Only successful people can do the anything . <\s>
<s> every human being waited for his first success in his life . <\s>
<s> then only he started his life on the first step . <\s>
<s> Then he/she starting life . <\s>
<s> Every human being waited for first success then only he started the next step . <\s>
<s> Once he or she started his/him success then dont look bacy days . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every successful human being waited for first success then only he started the next step . <\s>
<s> Only successful people knowing about the victory . <\s>
<s> Once they take sweetness of the victory they dont lok back again . <\s>
<s> They started new life on the next step , they prepared for his life more conviniently they disscussed about the success . <\s>
<s> They preparing well and to do somthing his life . <\s>
<s> They can only enjoying the life . <\s>
<s> They maintain the good things and developped new things in ours life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every successful human being can only fill the brightness of our life . <\s>
<s> Only successful human being can do the other successful plans . <\s>
<s> they only describing the new things . <\s>
<s> Successful people wont need other peolple help . <\s>
<s> Successful people can do anything in world . <\s>
<s> Now a days the world life in the hands of the successful people only they can change their life their convinient . <\s>
<s> they describing their self only . <\s>
<s> they can change the world featute .. <\s>
<s> They can change the maintaining the policy of the new technology and to maintaining the common things and to maintain the terminology and to describing the new things . <\s>
<s> The young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Life became very hard and very quickly that what make people very busy in their life , because they need always to be actives than they are can control the situition . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason make the young people do not give enough time to helping , because they are spend most time at working , so this reason make them ca n't control time very easy , because when they are get back home they are spended very long an work day and they try to get any chance to get good rest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason make young people do not help , because they are try to establish thier life and make thier futuer better , also they are speand alot of time for something make them spend their time more enjoy , so that make them too far to help another people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , because the young people still not adoult enough that make thier way to thinking deffirent like they are alwys thinking how to get more enjoy or more fun time , for example they are prefer going to play games more than they thinking to help another people , and they are like to looking about their partnar in this life to get marreged and creat thier own life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclousion , all these reasons , like working , life very hard and quick , the young people prefer more than like to help , so I am agree with the statement Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping . <\s>
<s> Travel in group is the best way to travel , because you know new people and you can make new friends in all the travel , and the travel can be better if you have a tour guide taht can explain alll the parts of the place that you are going to visit . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When you are in group you file like you are in home and all the group take care of all , the guide is lake the mom who teach the grupo all the places that they want to know , and to explain who make some buildings o when the construccion of one building started things that you really apreciate in a travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When you travel whit your family i thing that is boring that traveling whith your friend , because when you are whut your family they always go to know museums or thinks that you really do not wat to see , but when you go wuit your friens and you have a funny tour guide that is a unforgetable experiency , because you file like nobody is going to tell you wath to do or at what time you need to come back to the group . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When you travel alone i thing that you get bored so easy and you do not enjoy the travel , you only saw the buiding whitout now who was maked or when was maked i do not now things that really apreciate when you travel , but i thing that the convivence whit other persons is more nice that going alone whit nobody who make you smile or enjoy more the travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Traveling whit a group led by a tour guide is the best travel that you can have , no matter the place that you can go or the person that come with you , is more interesting . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I only say for the people who like to travel alone that are losing your time in a trip . <\s>
<s> I agree because when I sell the hous at Japan onday i show it to the people when it is rainy and now one boughet it but wenit is sunny the people said it is a good hous and think the othre thing is same like that . <\s>
<s> and at the TV they use the good one and I think they put some ool on to make it look better so I think it makes the products look gopod and I agree to this statement . <\s>
<s> I am very much helpful by this topic that successful people try new things and try to take risks . <\s>
<s> In my view success is not a one word game , it is defined by many ways at different level of life . <\s>
<s> A man got success simply is a dull man in every sence . <\s>
<s> Taking new thigs at level at different part of life is a interesting phenomena of life , i8n which a man need of interest can increase level by level . <\s>
<s> A person of a good deed always crazy about good feed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In life everybody should have position on which a person can be incharge by its own . <\s>
<s> Taking risk is not showing a stupidity of a person it shows that how much you careful about your life . <\s>
<s> In life there are so many situation occur where we find nothing exept blankness around ourself at that time we have no time to think on other environmet , so at time we take risk at any cost . <\s>
<s> Some get feared by taking risk , but at that time they forget that daythey have to do same activity at any level of our life . <\s>
<s> Many people try risk for there name and many person for reasonable activity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Foe example , if a person starts a business then he or she may taking risk at that program , this person has nothig to gain at initial level of there activty , so at that time only hard work and determination proceed him up . <\s>
<s> Likewise they get up wiyh new confidence at every step of there life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So we can now mention that successful person trying new thing and taking risk for there better tomorrow and there better life . <\s>
<s> If a person do well alone without trying not too much is not learn so much from there life , and that was not include there profile at high level . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thats why people need trying new thnigs . <\s>
<s> I agree . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement because i think that spots make his products seems better almoust always . <\s>
<s> From the producters point of view it is a very good think because in this way they think that it is possibole for them to sell mach more products and so it 's possible to make much more money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that this is not true in fact when someone goes to buy something because he sees that on tv or by some other kind of advertisiment , he mants to have that products with the propiety that were illustrated . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If he comes back home with his new object and whene hi tries it and it notes tha the propiety are not seems as the advertisiment 's ones , he is not sadisfaction at all . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When happens something like that the client will never buy again the same products and he will never buy anything else by the same factory . <\s>
<s> For example : is Chrismas , you want to buy to your son a new toy . <\s>
<s> You want to buy a small nice train that you saw on a tv spot . <\s>
<s> it has the railyway station and it is full of lights . <\s>
<s> the spot says that the lights turn really on . <\s>
<s> On the Chrismas day you give your present to your little son and you say to him the the lights turn really on . <\s>
<s> He is vary happy for that but when he trys to turn on the light nothing happens . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By now i 'm sure that you will never buy anything alse from the train 's factory . <\s>
<s> For this reason i think that a producter have to make a real and true advertisements for his products , in this way people who buy something from him are sadisfy and so they maybe will come back to buy something alse from his factory . <\s>
<s> In my opinion I think that the old people enjoy their life than the young people . <\s>
<s> There are many examples to show that . <\s>
<s> Some of the young people in this world have taking drugs or smokes . <\s>
<s> These two things do a lot of damage in the body , if you take a lot of drugs or smokes you may die . <\s>
<s> Some of the young people may go to die because they broke up with their grilfriend or boyfriend , I think that it is selfish . <\s>
<s> There are many thieves are young people too . <\s>
<s> Do you think that a person who enjoy or like their life will do these kind of things ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand I know many older people who study . <\s>
<s> I saw a lot of older people study in night school . <\s>
<s> One day i had asked aold man why he study in the night school ? <\s>
<s> He replid me that he did n't student good when he was young and he feel very bad about that . <\s>
<s> He also said that he want to know as much things as he can . <\s>
<s> I know a lot of older people who are leaning to use computer . <\s>
<s> I think that the old people are much more hard working than the young . <\s>
<s> Many student in my high school is sleeping , chatting , or playing games during the lessons . <\s>
<s> Most of them are waiting the bell ring they do n't know how important about student . <\s>
<s> The older people had lived in the world for a long thime , they know that knowledge is so important . <\s>
<s> They enjoy the process of learning . <\s>
<s> I know Many older people know that drugs and smokes are not good so they stop it too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that the older people enjoy the life than young people . <\s>
<s> They do a lot of good things that the young will not do . <\s>
<s> This is very important subject for argument , because there are two reasons they are help the subject health and bad habbits . <\s>
<s> First , about the health not all things we can try it , because may be it very bad for our health without we know . <\s>
<s> Forexample in one arabic country `` Yamen '' the yamenies people the use '' gat ' it is kind of drugs . <\s>
<s> They are use the drug without any information about it . <\s>
<s> they thought it is ver good for their health . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , about bad habbits some people when they leard about something new they like it . <\s>
<s> Then when someone likes something he or she can not take off this thing . <\s>
<s> such as somebody he tried to drive his or her car fast . <\s>
<s> then he or she became uesd to drive the car fast if anyone trys to tell him or her do not drive you car fast he or she will not listen to you . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end , i think it is useful if you learn new things and try to do it , but you have to get alot of informations about what you will try to do . <\s>
<s> Also ask your self `` is it good for me or not '' . <\s>
<s> I would like to do avrey thing good not bad for me or for anyone in my life . <\s>
<s> I agree with that , but in other hand I disagree with that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Just for me , If it is my first time to do if it is almost same kind of stuff , then I try to do it with my way . <\s>
<s> But when I have to do something new then I give up first and ask how to use it . <\s>
<s> Because most of time if I never had been used it before it 's somthing new . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think most people are same as me . <\s>
<s> If they do n't know how to do it , then ask first , they do n't try first . <\s>
<s> Why ? <\s>
<s> New stuffs are expensive . <\s>
<s> But if thay used to use almost same kind of stuff they try that way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people , if they are advanturous they try to do it , even though they do n't know how to do it . <\s>
<s> Those kind of people are not ask how to do it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Here is an example . <\s>
<s> I 'm an exchange student . <\s>
<s> Exchange student is came from other country to Americ and stay with regular family ( Host family ) , and go to high school for a year . <\s>
<s> When I was in Korea I had a younger sister ( she is 2 years younger than me ) , so we had to share almost every thing , but this family has only child which is do n't k <\s>
<s> In generally I agree with the more advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> I am a student , in my university there are always the most important advertisements , but I understand then they is not important only for refers to the segretary or refers to president . <\s>
<s> This is a small example of the statement . <\s>
<s> In fact there are many others than important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Sometimes I think at 11 September , when make a disastre not only for New York and United States but for the world . <\s>
<s> I think the news for this is more and more than the right number of news . <\s>
<s> I write this because I think the terrorists uses this type of diffusione for hits the person . <\s>
<s> I am a italian boy , and I and italian are most worry for this fact . <\s>
<s> In this case the largest news is wrong because this is a strument of terrorists for giving worry . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In generally there are more and more cases similar the 11 september tragedy , for example the war . <\s>
<s> Sometimes the newspapers is not interists of really news , but the giornalist continually great a news only for sell . <\s>
<s> This is a negative factor for my life , this is a negative factors for our life , not only for the italian , or american , but for all world , because the wrong news gives a wrong factors of the life , and then wrong opinion by the person who reading this type of newspapers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But another hand there are the opposite problem respect than most advertsements make products seem much better than they really are , sometimes in fact there is an opposite . <\s>
<s> This factor is most dangerous than the first , because this gives a strange vision of world , of war , of other ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For the conclusion I agree then the most advertsements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> I agree about that , because most advertisements make products . <\s>
<s> It is right answer . <\s>
<s> Advertisements make lots products . <\s>
<s> I could not understood . <\s>
<s> But may be I can know now . <\s>
<s> For example I can understand we can keep going to <\s>
<s> I think there will not be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years . <\s>
<s> There is two reasons like below . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At first , the present population in the world is six billion , and it never stop to increase , and it is said the world population is growing with much more high speed . <\s>
<s> So it is certain that the demand of car also increases with the increase of the population . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , I think it is difficult that we invent a brand new vehicle that is more convinient than car in twenty years . <\s>
<s> We have already had another transportation system like plane , ship , bicycle , but they are used with different needs , and they are not useful as a alternative of car . <\s>
<s> During all your professional or personal life , other people judge you on your knowledges , For instance the choices and orientations you have made during your studies are very important , especially in France where reconversion are very dificult to opere when you work in a sector for a long time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In one hand , you can think being specialized in a subject can brings you a lot of advantages , such as being very well paid or considerated like a specialist of this subject , Moreover , you can become famous and a reference , write books or be interviewed by journalists . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other hand , knowing less on a subject but several subject can show many others advantages . <\s>
<s> For instance , if your are very curious you will be more in accord with yourself if you can feed your mind with a lot of differents informations and knowledges . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , I did the choice to multiplicate my knowledges . <\s>
<s> Because I need to learn a lot of different things . <\s>
<s> That allowed me to change of profession and to be happy in my professional life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I would advise to curious person like me , to take the same way as I did in order to be q <\s>
<s> Most advertisements make products seem better than they really are , I am agree this stamente . <\s>
<s> In my expericences , I bouth products that seem to be --- really good , but threre not , The kind the publicity seems to looks to good , . <\s>
<s> One example the this is the hambuger , when they advertice looks so delicios , and when you tested is not to good . <\s>
<s> One another exaples is the car the advertise with a lot --- speeds this right , but you can not use this speed in the regular time , for my is better when adverse about the gas . <\s>
<s> An another examples the services advertise , sometimes you went to companies to have a services , and you not have the quality the services that you pay . <\s>
<s> In conclusion the advertisements play a big situation to sell products in the market . <\s>
<s> I am agree ! <\s>
<s> I think the specialize is the top model of the work . <\s>
<s> The specialize bear persons that can answer at the million of the problematiche specificly . <\s>
<s> Someone project is correlation at a lot of questions than one person specialized is abileted to requested . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But the academic 's preparation is n't sufficently at created new people specialized . <\s>
<s> I think that only university must changer the plan of the corses for he created a new model to the project and the work . <\s>
<s> Too many informations are made one person not complet . <\s>
<s> This person is competent in all and , in realy , he is n't competent . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The new specific sobject is a geat idea but the mode to creat is n't to know . <\s>
<s> I agree this statement which is more importaint for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Because if you understand ideas and concept , you can use the different way ahving your knowlege more than fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , Right now i am taking math class . <\s>
<s> Usually , every question already have the answer . <\s>
<s> You can check answer from the answerseet . <\s>
<s> However , when i was solving some questions , i could not get the answer . <\s>
<s> you might think you cans check the answer from the book . <\s>
<s> Even i check the answer and see the fact , i feel that i want to know the idea which how to get the answer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fact can not use different way , as i mention only know the answer which is fact is not able to use anotherway . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example is language . <\s>
<s> I am also taking Chinese class . <\s>
<s> every character has different meaning . <\s>
<s> some character has so cunfusing line and sometimes tree for four character is mix together and becomes one word . <\s>
<s> The word chinese character of domitory has roof , people , and hundred meaning of character . <\s>
<s> The reason why is that people live together under the oneYou just remember the word as fact , you might not care about reason . <\s>
<s> if you want to understand ideas of each word , you can guess the meaning . <\s>
<s> You can guess what is character means using your relative goods or life . <\s>
<s> if you just know the fact , you can not gusee anymore . <\s>
<s> everybody beleive that young people are main and important part of community . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , many of them do n't want to do the job which helps their communities to improve . <\s>
<s> I thtink there are some rasons decrease their desire to help their communities , such as ; every one of then think that it is not his job to work for the society or if he do n't help in work for the society , someone else will do that . <\s>
<s> Another reason , they find watching TV or playing football more interest than hlping their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some statistics show that 85 % of young people prefear to watch TV than helping the society . <\s>
<s> Also , many of them do n't know the name of their governor . <\s>
<s> Nowadays there is some thing affects the communities that their young people do not give enough time to help their communitise . <\s>
<s> That habens because of the followeing reasons : they have to study hard in schools or colleges , there are alot of entertainamint stuffs that take alot of there time , and they do n't fell the importance of helping the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , today the student has to study hard if he want to has a good futuer . <\s>
<s> studying hard takes a lot of time from the student . <\s>
<s> In the test week the parents may not see their son only for come menuites and then he goes to study . <\s>
<s> Studying not give the student enough of time to help the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Seconde , nowedays there are entertainamint stuffs that the young people plays for example , vidoe games , TV , and football . <\s>
<s> these thing take from young people alot of time playing it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , young people now do n't fell th importance of helping the community . <\s>
<s> They didnT learn that the community depend on them and they have to do anything to devilop their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can see now the reasons why young people do not give enough time to their communities . <\s>
<s> They have to scadeual their studies . <\s>
<s> They have to avoid playing all the time . <\s>
<s> Adults have to tell them why helping is importante for theier community . <\s>
<s> Then , they will have a a lot of time to helping their communities <\s>
<s> I disagree about this question for the following two reasons . <\s>
<s> First , comunicate with other people is basis for human beings . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , most young people have mobile phone and using it by not calling but mailing . <\s>
<s> In fact , mailing is useful and easy to send message . <\s>
<s> But I think mail is difficult to express their feelings . <\s>
<s> Second , I think human beings can not live alone . <\s>
<s> Everyone wants friends to speak of , and anyone loves human beings . <\s>
<s> A long time ago , there was no mobile phone , TV , and television game . <\s>
<s> So young people played outside with many friends who live nearby them . <\s>
<s> It caused their communities . <\s>
<s> But now , boys and girls play inside because of television game . <\s>
<s> It is bad for their health and heart . <\s>
<s> I hope young people play outside . <\s>
<s> Because they are treasure for future . <\s>
<s> Advertising is a very important concept in that century because all of the people have tandencey to consume more and more . <\s>
<s> Some of the advertisements can illustrate the product in the way that it can seem better than they really are . <\s>
<s> I disagree with this statement . <\s>
<s> My poit of view is different ... <\s>
<s> I thinks that there are a lot of car today and there will be more and more tomorrow .. <\s>
<s> My opinion is that until the reserv of petrol will finish the human did n't stop to make a new cars . <\s>
<s> The only way to stop this process is improve pubblic transport and make this more cheap than using car , but this will be not easy because it means make a change in politic 's mind and in big company 's rule . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Twenty years it 's a short time for make this inversion I thinks !! <\s>
<s> For example I had every morning an hours of car for make 25 km it 's crazy but it is always less in term of money and time than taking a pubblic bus . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We also assist at the evolvig of oriental states who are density populated and they are now using a bikecycles but not for even !! <\s>
<s> this will be a problem for earth healt . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I hope that my generation could view a society with less cars <\s>
<s> in my opinion is certnaly better have a general point of view about many academic subjects , and at the same time focus on particolar subject wich you think are the most important for your future or your work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I belive that have a general knowledge is important to undenstard better the subject wich you have choose to specialize in , beacouse all the subject are relate with other subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example students who studyied architecture can not focus on only about architecture , for undestand what architecure is , how is it made and how to plan it they necessity to know sociology beacouse sociology study human behavies and relathioship , and architecture is the place how behavies and relationship born . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And also they should know ecology beacouse buildings have a strong effect on nature and ecosystem . <\s>
<s> know geology is also important to predict the soul density . <\s>
<s> To achieve this big knowledge is necessary ask a to yourselves WHY ? <\s>
<s> why ths happen , why how is made <\s>
<s> I agree with that statemant . <\s>
<s> I believe that human 's mind control and power . <\s>
<s> Strong mind can make do something difficult from the person . <\s>
<s> Successful people always have a positive mind and strong mind . <\s>
<s> It is very important to people . <\s>
<s> So , they are not afraid adventure . <\s>
<s> It makes try new things to successful people . <\s>
<s> successful people know how to can be success . <\s>
<s> For example , i heard one story . <\s>
<s> It is story who a rich person . <\s>
<s> The rich man belive that he is going to die 50 years old . <\s>
<s> And he decided to spend his all money untill his death . <\s>
<s> The rich man was ca n't stop his spend money . <\s>
<s> When his age becam 50 years old . <\s>
<s> he was still alive . <\s>
<s> but he already became poor person . <\s>
<s> suddenly the rich man became homeless . <\s>
<s> he realized about his past days . <\s>
<s> And he started again work at 50 years old . <\s>
<s> When he was 70 year old , we was rich man again . <\s>
<s> He 's real life is started from 50 years old . <\s>
<s> When i heard that story , i so suprised . <\s>
<s> However , that story make me realized that successful is depend on person 's mind . <\s>
<s> And Who once expirenced to success know how to do well . <\s>
<s> As such reason , i support that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing wtat they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> i belive that travel with a group led by a tour guide is so important and nice becoues there a lot of dangras places in the word and also maby u dont know the city vare good . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> a travel with a group led its so funy and saftly and u will have alot of fun becuose there so mane people with you and you will have atghns top meet and make anew friend from you are city or amby anther city that help me wan i was travel a lone i want to egybt with a nice group and that give e a good exbereans to any way wan wan hour group was in the peramets i ahve some aksedanc a fool in the hores and i cant move my sholdr and the guide game and help my becues he know what to do and i was so scare and he toled me dont wore , and the guide will helap if we lost in the dasert bucaes he know the place very good and he will tell you alot of story maby if u go alone you will not knowt . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> for my a abrefer to travel with a group and guide that will give you atghtds to know more abot the plecs and the people there and abot the cltgher how is the people think and how thay will sey willcame and waht is the good food and telling you about the hasstory if the city . <\s>
<s> I have to say agree and disagree . <\s>
<s> First of all , why I agree is because only learn can not understund . <\s>
<s> But same time why I disageree is because every body has another oppinion so <\s>
<s> I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities from the following three reasons ; ( 1 ) they have enough time , ( 2 ) they have little intention to do , ( 3 ) their communities do n't expect young people to do , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , I believe they have enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Because they have a lot of time to play and go anywhere with their friends . <\s>
<s> According to a certain survey , young people use 60percent of their private time with their friends , 20 percent with family , 15percent with collegues of their company and 5percent with their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , they have little intention to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> They are little interested with staying with their communities . <\s>
<s> One of the biggest reasons is that they should follow their traditional customes . <\s>
<s> They are bothersome to young people . <\s>
<s> Most young people want to stay with their friends using modern equipments , such as TV game . <\s>
<s> In addition , besides helping their communities , young generation have a lot of chances and places to be involved and help other communities and wider world , such as other countries and cities and communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , their communities also do n't expect young people to envolve into the events . <\s>
<s> Because it is difficult both side to communicate well , teach something and stay together . <\s>
<s> Sometimes to helping the communities might be botherd and harmful to their communities . <\s>
<s> In my case , as I did n't know how to do , I could n't help any thing to my community in the past . <\s>
<s> As a result , I did n't want to be involved into their events as much as possible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From the above reasons , I do n't strongly agree that young generation recent days do not give satisfactory time to helping and be involved into heir communities . <\s>
<s> I disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is confusing and wasting time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects you wo n't be able to focus on specific subject . <\s>
<s> So , you probaply wo n't be able to determine which subject you should choose . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition to that , you will be wasting your time to know about diffrent subjects you batter save this time for your subject that you like for example , If I am interested in art I should look for subjects that are related to art . <\s>
<s> that will make me more interested in art and also having more knowledge about art . <\s>
<s> However , If I am interested in many subjects I will spend alot of time to know about many subjects that I am n't really interested in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In short , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is confusing and wasting time . <\s>
<s> I agree with the following statement . <\s>
<s> It is very usefuly in our life . <\s>
<s> Someone will be say `` life has to change new thing in this time '' . <\s>
<s> They think about study new thing comebe successsful . <\s>
<s> When you study old things , you can find the new way or the new things from the old things . <\s>
<s> How to choes the right way to follow statement ? <\s>
<s> At the first , you read a lot of books in your life . <\s>
<s> You can get many new things for the new feeling . <\s>
<s> I am Art student . <\s>
<s> i love to make design works in the everytime . <\s>
<s> Sometime i need find the new feel to open my mind . <\s>
<s> If i can not find anythings , I will be take look my old design works and think about how to make the new desigthings . <\s>
<s> Sometimes i very happy to open design new thing or following statement . <\s>
<s> Because my mom told me study old things you will be study the new knowlarge . <\s>
<s> So , i think i also study English as soon sa possible using the information in my life . <\s>
<s> The <\s>
<s> The popular products have seem great invents for people but this is not enough to be succed . <\s>
<s> People should not believe advertisements because they can not tell us they are true . <\s>
<s> And also people want more than beaty so they want to see and they want to try them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Sometimes we buy something but we do not think how it will work . <\s>
<s> Because we just look it 's beaty . <\s>
<s> Then we come our home and try it . <\s>
<s> When we try it we see it does n't work well . <\s>
<s> In fact , we start to tell other people it does not work so we get advertiser . <\s>
<s> When we think about advertisements we should be carefull because we do not watch advirtesements only in television or we do not listen them only in radio . <\s>
<s> A person is more important than television or radio . <\s>
<s> If the person start to influence somebody you can not stop it . <\s>
<s> Finally , every body hear it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If there is a bad firm which one uses advertisements to sell much better , it can be succed first of all . <\s>
<s> But in the socond time people will not prefer it . <\s>
<s> Advertisers do not see that they can not be successfull if they do not advertise good thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of advertisers use same way . <\s>
<s> They think they can control our minds easly with their advertisements . <\s>
<s> We watch or listen a lot of different products but the result is same . <\s>
<s> If you ask which one is better this one or other one you can not choose easly with advertisements beacause they say us all of them is better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do not believe advertisements to buy something . <\s>
<s> The above topic suggest such fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Apparetly , different people hold different view dues to their respective angles , it seems that it is a little bit hard any absolut consent . <\s>
<s> On the one hand , some people advocate that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> on the other hand , others disagree the above topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , in my mind , I think young people enjoy life more than older people do , that is ture . <\s>
<s> For enample , young people like noise place , bar , large shop , karo ... <\s>
<s> older people are difference , they like quire place park ( in the morning ) , walking , fishing ... <\s>
<s> How come ? <\s>
<s> because we are the young man , we have power , eneger . <\s>
<s> That is older people ca n't have . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , young people clearly than older people , I say a normal young man , for examples , memory young man is better than older man . <\s>
<s> So we can doing <\s>
<s> That is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> I believe that , I think students to understand ideas and concepts is more important than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Because it has two reasons . <\s>
<s> Such as , we can guess and think . <\s>
<s> It makes me understand easilly . <\s>
<s> And sometime , learn facts has wrong informations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , we have a lot of potenail ability . <\s>
<s> One of the good ability is the guess , predict , and think . <\s>
<s> It makes me easilly and help to understand . <\s>
<s> Actually we just learn facts that sometime do not understand because of if we can not thinking of learn facts . <\s>
<s> But we make the emagin that make me helpful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , sometime , learn facts has wrong informations . <\s>
<s> So we should to checks on internet or reference books . <\s>
<s> Almost people think about that they believe learn facts . <\s>
<s> But it is wrong think . <\s>
<s> Actually modern society is changing quikly . <\s>
<s> So it will be change the learn facts that is possible . <\s>
<s> So we have not believe that all of learn facts . <\s>
<s> They offer me corret answers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I agree that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Becase of it has two reason . <\s>
<s> The reason that we can guess , predict , and think . <\s>
<s> And then it makes me easilly and help to understand . <\s>
<s> Another reason is sometime , learn facts has wrong informations . <\s>
<s> Nobody knows how young people play more than older people ? <\s>
<s> Even though young people can enjoy like an adult . <\s>
<s> But , they ca n't completely like a old people . <\s>
<s> They want to go to another place and they want to eat delicious food . <\s>
<s> And they want to be an aduly . <\s>
<s> But we ca n't help them . <\s>
<s> Because , this world have rules . <\s>
<s> Also we have to keep those rules . <\s>
<s> But young people who is under 21 their law is smaller than adult 's low . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they are freedom . <\s>
<s> If young people have to strong of law , they cannot enjoy ther life . <\s>
<s> Also I would like to come back childhood . <\s>
<s> Just imagine ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If one family go to picnic or vacation , their children what are they doing ? <\s>
<s> May be , they will play . <\s>
<s> But their parents will work like a make a food or convey their carry . <\s>
<s> Also , their parents have to spend a money . <\s>
<s> Their parents need a money for a vacation . <\s>
<s> That 's too bad . <\s>
<s> Anyway , they have to make a money . <\s>
<s> Their children use thier parents money . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they enjoy their life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> That was what I am thinking . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , a lot of student go to university because their parents whants to , but it is not their desition . <\s>
<s> First of all , we can discuss the point what the sentence want to tell us with the words `` understand ideas and concepts '' . <\s>
<s> Undersand a chemestry fomule it will be problably hard . <\s>
<s> To understand a maths concept can be maybe easy . <\s>
<s> But student really care about understand ? <\s>
<s> I do not sure because the actuals student in hing school or secondary school just think at the moment and not for the problem they maybe can find in the future at university . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the second point we can discuss the second point in the subjet , it the `` leran facts '' . <\s>
<s> That is clear to says that leran and memorise meanings or formules in any subject than to understand or maybe try to understand something . <\s>
<s> We problably do not understand it why ? <\s>
<s> I think it problably because we don-t really think about the future and just to the present , Carpe Diem , we problably need or try to understand too all of the formules or the meanings of all of the subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think It will be easier for us to understand the ideas and concepts to help us to learn facts to us , because if we do not understand something we can really learn as good as we really understand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We maybe do not have the experience as an student in university , but at the end of the hing school we need to start thinking about this . <\s>
<s> I am disagree with this sentence because all of students now want to learn and they does not matter if they do not understand , they just want to know to do , for exemple a maths exercice for their exam to have a good grade , without thinking to the futur . <\s>
<s> I cannot to be in disagree with these words . <\s>
<s> Modern people need the car . <\s>
<s> We use the cars for many regions . <\s>
<s> We need it for the job and intertainment , for the holiday and for all things of our life . <\s>
<s> We can make an important consideration : the life is change , the world is change and it 's changing , in the modern life we need to move and go around always . <\s>
<s> Also the tecnology is changed , and all people can buy a car , now . <\s>
<s> Is 's more chap then ten years ago . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If in twenty years there will be fewer cars , it will be an important problem for the world , for the global and for the people . <\s>
<s> For use and drive a car we need way and park . <\s>
<s> But today there is n't this . <\s>
<s> The administrators know this problem but is difficult to risolv it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can say that we cannot live without cars . <\s>
<s> it 's strange , but it 's really . <\s>
<s> The life runs , and you have to run behind it . <\s>
<s> Today have a car is very important , and you ca n't live without it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , I live in a littel town near Milan , and if I have n't the car I cannot come to work or to study in Milano , because the train is ever on late , and there is n't other way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When I was young I do n't need the car because I can enterteiment myself in my town with my friends , but today young peaple have diffren necessery , and they want have ever the car . <\s>
<s> It is often said that advertising deceive pepole and creates needs . <\s>
<s> On one hand , I am going to see in what extent the advertising is able to influence us in our daily life ; then I will study how is it possible not to be deceived by this artificial world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On one hand , it is true that the main role of the advertising is to create an ideal world where everything seems to be perferct . <\s>
<s> The puropse of advertisments is to improve sells of a certain firm . <\s>
<s> That is to say , when you see a beautiful woman on a billboard who seems to be so happy , you want to buy this make up to be beautiful and happy too . <\s>
<s> But when you buy it , you realize that your life has not changed at all . <\s>
<s> In fact in our societies of consumption , advertising has become a great way to influence people by showing them an ideal universe . <\s>
<s> In fact , most advertisments do not really sell products but they sell dream . <\s>
<s> The real purpose of most advertisments is to sell and not to reflect the realityof the product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , I think that the advertising is not only a good way to increase sells but it is a kind of creativity . <\s>
<s> If the advertising is able to have such a great influence on people , it is because there is a real reflexion behind it . <\s>
<s> You always have posters with skin women , beautiful landscapes , and very efficient phrases . <\s>
<s> They are created to make you dream . <\s>
<s> And very often it works because in our modern societies , consumption is very important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , I think that is to easy to say that advertising deceive you because you have to be able to see where is the fronteer between the fiction and the real . <\s>
<s> That is to say , people should develop their critical spirit by reading , listenning and watching the tv to create their own opinion . <\s>
<s> In that case , my point is that parents play a great role in their children education and they have to teach us what is true and what is not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I have to admitt that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are but it is important to emphasize that it is also their first puropse . <\s>
<s> When I went to university I had to decid if attend a general major or a specilistic one and I have chossen the second one . <\s>
<s> I think it 's an important decision for life of peolple . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact if you decide to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can have a big knowledge about a lot of things . <\s>
<s> You can deal with a lot of things in very different situation and also you can do the rigth thing in different situations . <\s>
<s> In example you can talk with people that do n't attend your same class and have a general discussion of every subject . <\s>
<s> However this kind of knowledge ca n't be very specific . <\s>
<s> Therefore you can do a job that needs general knowledge but not a specialistic job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Instead if you decide to specialize in a specific subject you do n't have any problem . <\s>
<s> In fact you can study one subject and know almost everything about it . <\s>
<s> I think this is the best way to find a good job , beacause you know something that other people not specialized do n't know and there is always someone that pay you for this specialistic knowledge . <\s>
<s> Therefore I choose a specialistic major and I disagree with the given stament . <\s>
<s> In addition if you specialize in one specific subject you can reach the best results in what you study . <\s>
<s> In example I like to study the chemical compositions of the materials and I can specialize in what I like instead of studing a lot of subjects that I do n't like . <\s>
<s> According to this , the best thing of specializing in one specific subject is that you can concentrate your efforts in just one thing and you have not to diverge your attenctions in differents subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore this is why I think it 's better for someone that wants to do good things in his life to specialize in one specific subject and not in many of them . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . <\s>
<s> Youth is the age where the people has fresh blood with more innovations and ideas accompanied with the easy nature to face the hurdles and make them the most joyous situations . <\s>
<s> They enjoy the life of that short period with the everything they can afford . <\s>
<s> The people falling under teenage are the people we see enjoy mostly leaving about all the risks and pains they are facing in their rootines of life . <\s>
<s> They enjoy life in many ways they are gifted with for example they may go with friends to the parties and discos or for movies to get out of their busy life schedule , all these entertainments are growing rapidly with the competition of the todays world keeping in mind the youths requirements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people are the people who got efficient energy to perform their talent by enjoying themselves , for example to dance this can be done only with these people and in contrast the old people cannot dance as they got no sufficient energy with them . <\s>
<s> The people of the teenage basks with the friends and their relatives and they make the people around them feel in the seventh heaven with their scilly jokes . <\s>
<s> They are the citizens of the country who are the most joyful persons in the country . <\s>
<s> The people though come from different cultures and backgrounds , makes their life easy when they come to their teenage , all leaving the hurdles they are facing in their routines life . <\s>
<s> As the lifes crucial part is the teenage the youth enjoys more when compared to the other people , they are the people who resemblances the country 's nationality and brotherhood . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence in apposite to the above said qualities , the young people enjoys the life more than the older one . <\s>
<s> Thus the major crucial part of life is the teenage for every humanbeing who faces and feels not to get end0 that life . <\s>
<s> This is a hard question , because succes means not the same thing for all the people , and also because both ways can take you to succes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my case , I am a tennis player . <\s>
<s> For me succes would be to become a Professional Player . <\s>
<s> For this to achieve there are no secret formulas , there are no new things to try , nothing like that , but doing what must be done , and what has been done since the early years of this sport , working for it . <\s>
<s> Also when playing tennis there is something you always have to have in mind `` if it is working and giving you results do not change or try something new '' , so succesful tennis players do not take great risks , nor try new thing , they just do what they know they do best , and stick to it if it is working . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So this makes me think things should work like this in every other subject , if something is giving you succes , why changing it ? <\s>
<s> Maybe if you are just in search of that `` success '' in other subjects rather than sports you should try new things , for example in pizzas , we have Dominoes , Pizza Hut , Peter Piper Pizza , etc ... <\s>
<s> so maybe thinking in subjects like this it is hard getting success following the same steps others did long ago , beacuse of all the competition , maybe it would be easier thinking of a not so compited subject , so maybe here it is when you will have to try new things , explore new markets etc .. <\s>
<s> but if you find success with something do n't try to change it , as long as it is giving you what you look for keep doing the same , or if you something well , no matter there is a lot of competition , keep doing it , because if you really do your thing well , people will notice about it and results will arrive sooner or later . <\s>
<s> Although it 's important to learn ideas and concepts in textbooks , I disagree the statements that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the ideas and concepts are origined from facts . <\s>
<s> For example , capitalism , one of the economic ideas , had been generated around 19th century in the United Kingdom when they made stock markets . <\s>
<s> This idea was generated from the fact that the stock markets was made . <\s>
<s> The facts give the ideas and concepts when people try to understand the phenomenon of facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , the new facts are not defined as ideas and concepts immediately since the ideas and concepts are produced through discussion of facts . <\s>
<s> It takes time for people to generate ideas and concepts through the long procedure of discussion and comprehension . <\s>
<s> Still we do n't know why the pyramids in Egypt were constructed . <\s>
<s> This is completely mistery of ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> But we can learn the facts that pyramids were constructed through history . <\s>
<s> We could miss some point if we focus on only ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Needless to say , sometimes the ideas comflict with each other because people comprehend the facts individually and generate ideas differently . <\s>
<s> Those different ideas generate conflicts . <\s>
<s> I assume that the wars are induced since the happiness is defined by individual people . <\s>
<s> For example , people in some countries believe in communism , one of the political ideas , and the other people believe in democratism . <\s>
<s> Those might start wars at some points . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , I agree it 's very important to refer ideas and concepts in written texbooks according to facts because this process helps student to understand the facts better . <\s>
<s> However , students should study facts at first since those ideas are always origined from the facts . <\s>
<s> Students can learn about many thing in school . <\s>
<s> When students learn new thing , It is very import for student to know what they are leaning from classes . <\s>
<s> And there are some advantages and disadvantages at the same time to understand the key concepts and to learn only facts . <\s>
<s> I prefer understanding the basic concept to learning facts from the text books . <\s>
<s> To understand the basic idea is not simply but , in my opinion , it can expand student 's abilities of thinking and creation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Understanding new ideas and concepts can take long time and sometimes it could take few decades for students . <\s>
<s> It can be problem to learning new things . <\s>
<s> That 's why some instructor and students take shortcut to learn new things . <\s>
<s> For example , when students who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio , so called ` Golden ratio ' which is believed as perfect proportion for every object . <\s>
<s> It is very difficult theory to understand for specially freshman and it could take more than 2years , but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even though difficultes to understand the ideas , students who understand the basic concepts can apply what they learn through it . <\s>
<s> It can be easy to creat new things with the basic concepts . <\s>
<s> For instance , a musician who understand the principle of music elements can compose many different kinds of songs and lythm using the basic music element . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , I recommend to understand the main ideas when students learn new thing . <\s>
<s> Even though it is hard and difficult way to learn about new things , after understanding the notion from the basics . <\s>
<s> It would bring great abilites to students . <\s>
<s> That 's the main reason I study and research in order to understand the concepts in the class . <\s>
<s> It is a controversal problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not . <\s>
<s> Differnet people may make different disscions acroding to their backgroud . <\s>
<s> Some friends of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such as math or music . <\s>
<s> But acroding to my own personality and backgroud , I can not agree with them . <\s>
<s> I think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Reasons and evidences are listed as following . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The world now , unlike 100 years before , needs man who only know one subject . <\s>
<s> It needs people can have a broad knowledge . <\s>
<s> For example , the engineers now ont only need to know about engineering , but also need to have the ablity to use computer . <\s>
<s> Because most of their works are completed on the computers . <\s>
<s> So if he is only a specialist about engineering , he will not finish his work prefectly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Forthemore , Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to make the students get used to the world now as well as to let them have a wide choose for the future . <\s>
<s> It is hard to say that a student majors engineering will become an engineer after his graduation . <\s>
<s> It is common to see students in college change their majors . <\s>
<s> But a man only good at one subjuect will not have the free to do so . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As the most morden buildings are the mixture of music and painting . <\s>
<s> A specialist is the man who soecializes in more than one subject . <\s>
<s> The famous English detecter in the noverl are good at detective and music . <\s>
<s> Such examples can be seen during every day life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A man should have a wide knowledge of many subjects because the world needs him to do so . <\s>
<s> Though some people may think that too much interest will make the man good at nothing . <\s>
<s> But I think a capable man can benifit from his wide interest , for his interest will finally help his to do achieve in his major <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Knowing facts is very important but we always need to think , and I believe that it is more important to have better understanding of things and concepts to make good decisions in real life . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concepts give you a skill of sloving a problem when you come across to something . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and learning facts are closely connected . <\s>
<s> If you have an idea about something , you think about it , learn about it , and everntually learn a fact . <\s>
<s> In another word , is a process of learning facts . <\s>
<s> For example , if you know what is happening in Iraq , if you do n't have an understanding for it , you do n't do anything for it . <\s>
<s> Facts without your opinion or concepts are useless even though how important the fact is . <\s>
<s> Process will leads you to the result and you learn a lot of things through out the process . <\s>
<s> I believe this from my experience . <\s>
<s> Once when I had a homework to search about the Titanic , I was just looking for a website that says what happened to it in the beginning , but soon I realized there were lots of things that happened other than sinking nad I learn much more interesting event that actually happened before it sank . <\s>
<s> Process is more important than a fact and i will lead you to the result which is a fact . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , I say to myself `` care about process than a fact '' because it is easy to forget and only look for a fact . <\s>
<s> Ever consider that what the world will look like if there is no expert on medicine , computer sciece and engeers ? <\s>
<s> Why would a company hire someone if he or she just have a general knowledge or without certain special skills ? <\s>
<s> Can you imagine the rapid development of morden sciecen and technology whithout specialized knowledge ? <\s>
<s> I really believe that people should have sbjects in specialized field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , mordern society need a proper distribution of worker groups that have special skills and serve as special purpurses . <\s>
<s> In fact it is the experts from differen areas that give us the life facilities . <\s>
<s> If all the people have a general knowledge in our society , there will be specialized madical services , convenient trasport system . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , it will be very helpful for people to get a job if he have been trained in special areas . <\s>
<s> Certain companies deal with certain issues concerned with our life . <\s>
<s> If you have a very deep and specialized skills , you are more likely to be heired by a company . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if all the people have the same trainning with the same background knowledge , it is hard to say that company will benefit from their stuffs ' comman performance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , the constant accumulation of knowledge of certain specialty need the constant effort that experts have to contribute . <\s>
<s> Every single acdemic specialty need new improvement of its own . <\s>
<s> If every one have the same background , it is hard to believe that science will be going on . <\s>
<s> In fact , knowladge of special field brings a much deep understanding of certain area . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , people should , in some distance , have a general information about what the whole world is like . <\s>
<s> A general knowledge will cast some ideas to special area . <\s>
<s> For example , biologists get the concept of computing the huge information presentede by thousands of billions of DNA code . <\s>
<s> And also , a broader interesting about the world will give people a more freer and opener mind . <\s>
<s> But if we caculate the whole advantages of speicial subject , I would claim that special trainings should be obtained , only for the benefit of the society and ourselves . <\s>
<s> It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Concepts are the most confidence state in the accuracy of many facts . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts can give more informations effectively and ideas and concepts can imply more successfully in anytime . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , concepts are the most confidence state in the accuracy of many facts . <\s>
<s> Facts may remain for short amount of time . <\s>
<s> In other words , facts are not very accurate . <\s>
<s> However , concept is made from many facts . <\s>
<s> People gather many facts from books or experiments and they analyze datas . <\s>
<s> Therefore , it is more accurate and can be used for long time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , ideas and concepts can give more informations effectively . <\s>
<s> For example , a teacher gives many facts to the students . <\s>
<s> Students will not understand the facts . <\s>
<s> Although teacher explains the fact , students may have difficulties to understand them . <\s>
<s> Facts can be ambiguous to students and students will start to memorize the facts without understanding them . <\s>
<s> Therefore , students will forget the facts more easily . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , ideas and concepts can imply more successfully in anytime . <\s>
<s> A student ca n't imply the facts successfully in the real society . <\s>
<s> For example , a doctor knows a high fever can kill a person . <\s>
<s> However , he does not know why high fever causes death . <\s>
<s> Then , he ca n't find the solution of the problem . <\s>
<s> When a doctor knows the concept of the problem , he will have idea what it causes the death . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts comprise many facts . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts can imply more successfully in anytime . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Economic rules changed a lot during the last sixty years . <\s>
<s> The arrive of television and the expansion of mass medias in general brougth to a different consideration of people forming a society : we 're no more considered as a mass of different personalities who must share rules to coexist , but also and very often only as a mass on consumers who have to buy the same products . <\s>
<s> This brougth to a challenge to convince consumers to buy a certain product instead of another one . <\s>
<s> To do this , advertisements try to make product seem much better than they really are , and expecially better than the direct challenger . <\s>
<s> A typical example that comes in my mind referres to the Michelin tyres advertisement . <\s>
<s> All over the world we can see advertisements stating that Michelin is the best producer for tyres and where is possible , the advertisement explains that Michelin in much better that Bridgestone , that is another tyres producer , directly challenging Michelin . <\s>
<s> In the Formula1 championship , that is a race car championship , Michelin and Bridgestone face each other directly , since they are the only producers allowed to build those special kind of tyres that are required for Formula 1 . <\s>
<s> In the 2005 Indianapolis Formula 1 Grand Prix , Michelin and Bridgestone equiped a different number of cars , as always . <\s>
<s> During the racing weekend , a lot of Michelin tyres explosed , and only them : no Bridgeston tyres had problems . <\s>
<s> Because of this problem , no cars using Michelin tyres could challenge on Sunday , during the race . <\s>
<s> Only cars using Bridgestone tyres were allowed . <\s>
<s> That was a perfect example that Michelin is not the best tyres producer as the advertisements stated . <\s>
<s> Michelin , after the problems created , had to refund the cost of the tickets to the spectators , paid for the damages occurred to the teams and first of all , had a huge image damage , since every consumer could't forget what happened that year in Indianapolis . <\s>
<s> With technology , advertising products became much easier . <\s>
<s> You can see advertisements in lots of places such as televisions , supermarkets , radios , and much more . <\s>
<s> I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , with the technology available these days , it is very easy to make animations or make pictures better . <\s>
<s> This technology has been used in making advertisments . <\s>
<s> It changes the way people think about the quality of the product by making it much better than what it actually is . <\s>
<s> This can be achieved by many ways , such as making the product attractive or by comparing it to other good brands . <\s>
<s> Also , advertisements tend to be repeated alot , giving the public an impression that the product is something special to be repeated that much . <\s>
<s> They will then go to the closest retail stores to buy the product just to find that the quality is not what they expected . <\s>
<s> In addition , many different advertisements of the same product could be made . <\s>
<s> Those advertisements could include famous stars such as actors or sport players . <\s>
<s> This usually is intended for the younger audience , as they are most attracted to it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end , advertising products attracts many people these days by making them belive the products are good . <\s>
<s> I believe that in the future , people will be decieved to an extent that they will believe that the lowest quality products are the best of the line . <\s>
<s> I agree with young peole enjoy more than older people do . <\s>
<s> There are two reasons why I agree with that statement . <\s>
<s> Firstly , young people are healthier and younger than older people . <\s>
<s> For example , my grandmother loves to travle around the world . <\s>
<s> However , she can not do right now because of her health . <\s>
<s> She used to tell me that she travels a lot . <\s>
<s> She found the joyness and purpose of bieng alive from meeting new people and learning otherthings that she could not experience before . <\s>
<s> I think if she was healthier and younger like me . <\s>
<s> It would be better to enjoy her life . <\s>
<s> In my age , I can go anywhere I want to because I am heathy and young . <\s>
<s> I can actually enjoy my life doing whatever I want to . <\s>
<s> I think that health is big part of one of reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , there are many entertainments for younger people but not for adults I guess . <\s>
<s> In korea , where is my home country , there are many fun things to do for young ages such as clubbing , playing game , singing songs in karayoke , taking sticker pictures with friends , and dating with boyfriends or girlfriends . <\s>
<s> I am not saying that older people can not date each other . <\s>
<s> However , there are not that many things for adults like old people . <\s>
<s> They might go to drink or watch movies very sometimes but that is not always fun and joyable . <\s>
<s> I think that there are more entertainments for younger ages than older ages . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I agree with young people enjoy more than older people do . <\s>
<s> There are two reasons that I mentioned before . <\s>
<s> For enjoing life , portion of health requires a lot and I think that is the most important opinion for this statement . <\s>
<s> Another reason is that there are many entertaints for younger people rather than older people . <\s>
<s> Well , I disagree , because both options are important for a complete learning . <\s>
<s> Imagine an education that consist only in ideas . <\s>
<s> It would be incomplete , because the ideas are always changing , a phenomenon that increase in a world like this , where the global communications are very efficient and we are exposed to a lot of information from a very diffents persons and ways of life . <\s>
<s> So , we do not have to concentrate in that type of education , base it only an ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But , in the other hand , an education base it only in facts is not good enought , because in the future , and maybe in the near future , the things that we consider true may change , and sometimes that occurs in a radical way . <\s>
<s> For exemple , some years ago , a scientist does not have the knowledge of the genoma , so he believe that a disease can not be cure . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , the medical treatments are better , because of the study of mothers cells and the genoma . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The key world in this teme is changes , because all the human knowledge is in risk of change . <\s>
<s> The persons in the ancient world think that the world were plane , and the other planets and the Sun moving around us . <\s>
<s> In accord of that , the Earth was the center of the system , but that fact change with the discover of new facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It happens the same with the ideas , they are always changing and the human race can not stop that process , because it is natural and normal . <\s>
<s> We can not imagine a a world without changes , we live because the world change . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We , for example , also change . <\s>
<s> When we have kids we were afraids about things that in the present day we do not . <\s>
<s> We can laught about the fears o the past , and the way they ruled of behavior . <\s>
<s> When we are in love , for example , we can imagine the world without that person , the person we love , we do not wanna to even imagine that . <\s>
<s> But , oh , what a tragedy ! , when a relationship ends , and sometimes that happens in the worst terms , we can resist that person . <\s>
<s> A simililar process are involve in politics and other elements of our society , in constant move and change . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The human evolution is a history of contradiction and false promises and we can not be sure about a lot of things . <\s>
<s> For all that , our education must involve facts , but also the crafts for understand the changes of that facts , and those crafts are the concepts and the ideas . <\s>
<s> The claim of the question is that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I strongly agree with the claim since the following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , the government has begun to develop some rules and laws to encourage people to use mass transportation . <\s>
<s> The government has some advertisements on TV to promote usage of mass transportation . <\s>
<s> Through the activities , people would change their minds . <\s>
<s> Besides , the government has raised taxed for people who own cars and increased the burdens of these car owners . <\s>
<s> For example , in Taiwan there has some laws to raise taxes of car owners . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , it is harder to find parking spaces for car owners , especially when people live in a big city . <\s>
<s> Besides , it is expensive to rent a parking space in a big city . <\s>
<s> Let me take Taipei as an example , the car owner should pay at least 6,000 NTD to rent a parking space a month . <\s>
<s> Some people may argue that they can affort to pay the money . <\s>
<s> However , some people jsut can not find a good parking space even they want to pay the money . <\s>
<s> Since the all parking spaces in Taipei are not enough for all cars . <\s>
<s> Hence many car owners begin to consider the mass transportations , such as bus , taxi , and subway , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , people have concensus that too much cars would pollute our environment . <\s>
<s> Now some families may own more than one car , but actually they just need one car . <\s>
<s> Under the strongly environmental pressures , people start to know the importance of environmental protection . <\s>
<s> Too much cars will pollute the earth and endanger the existence of human beings . <\s>
<s> Therefore , it can be predicted that more countries would cooperate to decrease the pollutions through some contracts or rules that limit the cars owned by each country . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , considering the aforementioned reasons , I strongly agree with the claim that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , since the environmental issues and the efforts from the government to limit the quantity of cars . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , there are ongoing statesments which people have to learn only one subject specific or learn several subjects . <\s>
<s> Somepeople think that people have to learn one subject in detail , because if people go out to social they definitely attend company which is related with they major . <\s>
<s> However , I firmly believe that people have to learn many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> There are two reasoens which is comunicated with another field people and understand how world goes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , if people learn several fields knowledge , we can communicate with another field person . <\s>
<s> Most of people think we do not use another knowledge when we get a jod . <\s>
<s> However it his a misleading information . <\s>
<s> For example , if my job is accoutant , I always met several job person such as sometimes I will meet bank job person , sometime I will meet proffessor . <\s>
<s> If I met another feild of person , I should talk something such as familiar with meeting person . <\s>
<s> In that case if I just talk about one specific subject , they will definitely boring . <\s>
<s> If we learn several knowledge , we can know more several fields person in our life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that it is hard to know how our country goes . <\s>
<s> A lot of news talk about several field story such as economy , biology . <\s>
<s> According to Cho-Sun daily news which is published in Korea . <\s>
<s> They reseach Who can understand the news more correctly . <\s>
<s> They made two groups . <\s>
<s> One is accuately learn one subject specific , and another group learn many academic subject . <\s>
<s> In conclusion of this research , 73 percent of the latter group people can understand the new more correctly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclsion , as I mentioned above , I agree that broad knoledge of many acdemic subjects are more better than learn one specific subjects . <\s>
<s> Young people do not have the necessary knowledge to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> One could argue that their lack of experience is an obstacle for them because they sometimes give too much importance for a bad news which appear at the end not to be so bad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With their experience older people know better what is really important . <\s>
<s> They are wiser than young people - this is often illustrates in the tales where the old man represents wise and knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> They have learn a lot from some past events the youth only knows through historical books . <\s>
<s> They also have had the time to read a lot , tro travel ... <\s>
<s> All these elements help them to understand better the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This could be a bad thing too : it is sometimes better not to be aware of the situations in order to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> People would sometimes prefer to return to their child-time , when they were innocent . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover old people do not have the same physical faculties as young people . <\s>
<s> In the majority of cases when people are mentally matured to enjoy life , they are no more physically capable of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All this points are based on general observations but happiness is not only a mater of age and depends on every person . <\s>
<s> Enjoyable moments result from on a lot of things , including some events we can provoke and some events we can not control . <\s>
<s> In daily life there are a lot of products and some of this are not so good , but most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ! <\s>
<s> Yes , I am agree with this statement because I think that a person have to touch with his hands the product he need becase if we follow only the advertisements he can fall in a not good product . <\s>
<s> For example , if I have to buy something products the first thing is watch this prodict and analyze it because I want to know it is good or not . <\s>
<s> Is like buy a T-shirt of a famouse stilist or a not famouse stilist , all the people prefer the first one because have the name but when they buy it , they do not look the material ( for example ) , they buy it because is made from a famous stilist . <\s>
<s> But if we research more and more in another store I think that we can find a better T-shirt with a low cost . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example is a dishes soap that i call with the name ` A ' , the advertisement say that A can clean everithing and your dishes will be white like the best white thing . <\s>
<s> Than a person go to buy it because the advertisement say that A do miracles , and when he wash his dishes , he observe that what the advertisement says is not true ! <\s>
<s> Than , in summary I want to say that is important to think befor to do everything especially when we have to choose some product to buy , because sometime we can take a products that most advertisements make much better than thy really are and everytime this is a tipical thing for to spend a lot of money for a products that is not good . <\s>
<s> The first thing to do is think and the second is choosing the best product for its quality and for its cost . <\s>
<s> There are several views which is related to this topic . <\s>
<s> Some may think that there is no helping from young people for their communities . <\s>
<s> However , I disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays , there are a lot of social problems in the world . <\s>
<s> These problems have to solve by citizens . <\s>
<s> However , if it ca n't solve at the first generation , the new generation , young people is needed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , we can easily observed from the cases that most of university student is participating for their society . <\s>
<s> They sometimes resist about unfair politics or not good enough international plans . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For these case , we can realize that how they are really interested in thier society and try to help thier communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , all societies are educating young people . <\s>
<s> This education makes student to think and adjust for their new life when they grow up . <\s>
<s> So we can not determine that they are not helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Because studying is the basic resource which makes educated people to think about social problems and to find the way to solve some problems . <\s>
<s> For a real , educated people usually participate their sociey . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , the school has a resposible for educating people without any limitations except ages . <\s>
<s> They educate not only academic resources but also the importance about helpful behaves to poor people . <\s>
<s> We can easily notice from activities in school like go to orphanage and help orphans . <\s>
<s> Of course , it is involved in the scores and most school requires the record of working for poor people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people are educated efficiently for help their communities . <\s>
<s> When they educated , they naturally have an attitudes to think about social problems as well as the student who did not study hard . <\s>
<s> Also young people is the main resources which will manage and control the world . <\s>
<s> Thus , it is not appropriate argument that young people is not helping thier communities . <\s>
<s> Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , I disagree with this statement for the following reasons : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every age differs from the one before it and everyone should know that every age has its own unique way in thinking , learning and solving problems so what we did and doing to our communitiy now is different than our olders did to there at there age so they will think that we as a young people are giving nothing to our communitiy because it is different than what they did when they were at our age . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> New technologies is spreading all over the world in a super fast ways that is helping the community to improve and to facilitate life and with the help of young people these technologies will be spreading and improving even faster with there new ideas cause as usual new ideas and revoloution ideas gets created from a young person , just like when an owner of an old factory refuses to use the computrized inventory system and stick to the old one that is maybe effictive but not as efficiant as the new system is . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> No one can forget the great things our older people did and achived to make our life more easy . <\s>
<s> but younger people will help in their communitiy because it is a must and life will stop if they didnt , and as usual when young peolpe grow up they will repeat the same statement that younger people are not helping their communities because thats the circle of life . <\s>
<s> In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do n't agree with this statement because everyone wants to have a car . <\s>
<s> In this essay I will give some reasons why I have this opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all and that 's in my opinion the main reason why I think that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today , is that most of the people get richer , so they earn more money and they want to have a good reputation and to look great , that 's why most rich people want to have the newest and best looking cars at the moment . <\s>
<s> In addition to that the cars are getting cheaper with the time because the automobile industry produce more cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that the youth want to have cars earlier so they get cars often as a present . <\s>
<s> Today the people do n't really want to live anymore in the cities , so they move to the suburbs and sometimes it is n't possible to reach other places without problems , then it is more practical to have very early a car to be more independent . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion in few years the cars will have such a high technical standard which is better for the environment than today and this will be another important reason why there will be more cars in the future than now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I disagree with the statement and with the reasons I have listed above I support my opinion . <\s>
<s> People will earn more money not to have only one car , but two or three . <\s>
<s> Then a new technology will appear in a few years , and will be a second reason why car driving wo n't be worse for the environment anymore . <\s>
<s> The last reason will be that people will move from the cities to the suburbs . <\s>
<s> The fluently use and buy of the cars is the typical sign of a develop and rich state . <\s>
<s> Infact the more concentration of cars is in the western state . <\s>
<s> There are many reasons to condivide this opinion . <\s>
<s> The terrible increasing of pollution is the most important aspects to take in consideration . <\s>
<s> Infact , by this dipend other factors . <\s>
<s> The problem of pollution we will hold with a production of less dangerosu cars for the envaironment , but the best solution is that increase the pubblic transport like metropolitan , bus , train . <\s>
<s> If the pubblic transport will be more capillar and efficent , the use of cars can be reduce seriously ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One more important reason is justified by the traffic . <\s>
<s> A lot of cars has been invasion the street : the result is the most dilatation of the time to travel . <\s>
<s> This problem make more in evidence the problems of pollution and pubblics transport . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But I think it 's true the opinion of the decreasing of the number of cars , but not in the middle period . <\s>
<s> Infact I think are more less twenty years for change the most complicated abitude of the man . <\s>
<s> The solution about the some problems already write , can be the use of another type of material different the oil : for example the hydrogen , or sun energy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It 's possible that we will have a less percentual of buying cars , but not fewer cars . <\s>
<s> Cities like Los Angeles are the clear exemple of thousands of people every day victims of the traffic . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , i disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I think both of the situations is very important for the students . <\s>
<s> ( understand ideas and concepts , learn facts . ) <\s>
<s> the two situations combine with each other . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> firstly , understanding ideas and concepts is useful for the students . <\s>
<s> By the way the students can learn the ideas . <\s>
<s> so the students have an opinion about the situation . <\s>
<s> for example ; while learning about a war , the student should learn the ideas and concepts of the war . <\s>
<s> ( what is the importance of the war for other companies , the other persons opinions about the war , where it begans ... <\s>
<s> etc ) before the student dont understand the ideas and the concepts of the war , they cant have a focus on the war . <\s>
<s> not only understanding ideas and concepts of the war but also learning the facts of the war has an important role for the students . <\s>
<s> if the students want to learn about the war , the students have to being successful in two situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> secondly , when learning facts is not enough for the students . <\s>
<s> for example ; the student learn the facts of the happening , ( for example by learning the facts of the war , the student can understand the war anda then the student can built their opinion strongly ) but if the student dont understand the ideas and concepts of the happening , the situation doesnt have a place in the students mind . <\s>
<s> then , the student wont remember the situation . <\s>
<s> so it means the situation is temporary for the student . <\s>
<s> By understanding the ideas and concepts , the student can develop their ideas . <\s>
<s> So the student can improve yorself about the situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> in conclusion , the students not only understand ideas , but also learning facts . <\s>
<s> they gave enough importance for both of situations . <\s>
<s> so they learn the situations well by understanding ideas , concepts and learning facts . <\s>
<s> I am agree to young people enjoy life more than older peple do . <\s>
<s> Young peple have a lot of power and enagy . <\s>
<s> If they do n't use those for enjoying life , I think that is very wasting way . <\s>
<s> They should use those in young age . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now I am young . <\s>
<s> I am a high school student . <\s>
<s> I think I enjoy my life more than older peple . <\s>
<s> To go somewher with my friends , to go shopping with my family , to chat with unknow people on the enternet , to drow pictures , to finght with frends , amd more whatever . <\s>
<s> Some of there are needed to young power . <\s>
<s> Some older people can do these . <\s>
<s> But when I become older person , I think I ca n't do these all . <\s>
<s> Because I will lose power . <\s>
<s> I might be tired early . <\s>
<s> I know I will become like my thinking . <\s>
<s> So I have to enjoy my life now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , older peple enjoy their life by using money . <\s>
<s> They go to big trip , to get houses , and to eat rich foods etc . <\s>
<s> This enjoyment is defferent to young 's enjoyment . <\s>
<s> They want to relax . <\s>
<s> They wo n't to use such a enagy . <\s>
<s> I think our feeling of enjoying and their feeling is defferent . <\s>
<s> They are enjoy ther life , and we are enjoying our life same as the others . <\s>
<s> If we are enjoying by defferent feelings , I cannot say which is nice , or bad . <\s>
<s> All peple enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> I think that 's very nice . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Anyway , I hope to enjoy my older life in the feauture . <\s>
<s> And I would enjoy now too . <\s>
<s> I should play more . <\s>
<s> When I become an adult , I will think `` I had to do someting more in the high school ! <\s>
<s> Why now my life is so busy ? '' <\s>
<s> . <\s>
<s> I do n't want to say so . <\s>
<s> So , now I am trying to search more fun things ! <\s>
<s> I want to enjoy more my life . <\s>
<s> Some people may think knowing the facts is more important than knowing the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Some people may think in different way . <\s>
<s> What I suggest is that let student to understand ideas and concepts it is more important for students only to learn the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Refer to the subjects i had study in high school , some of them i can not remember it clearly , some of them i still have the class picture in my mind . <\s>
<s> The different between these subujects is the subject i still have picture in my mind is what i had interest in . <\s>
<s> When people learning something having a interest in it is more effective than having a good teacher in the class . <\s>
<s> It is not because teacher is not important but because if someone have the interest in something this will help this person learn better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To understand the ideas could help the students to understand the subject more . <\s>
<s> Like learning the language if someone have that language background already , it will help that person learn more effective . <\s>
<s> knowing something 's working the idea like the background that person have . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Knowing the concepts likes a person has some experiences before him to study something . <\s>
<s> Everybody knows have experiences before then to start something could help that person to really understant the subject alot than the first time . <\s>
<s> It is as same as someone had study a subject before , this personwill has more chance to earn a better mark . <\s>
<s> Therefore , knowing the concepts can not be ingored . <\s>
<s> It is the basic step to get upper level . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than only for them to know the facts . <\s>
<s> Usually for students facts are boring , like the meat other person had eaten before , students can not learn much about it . <\s>
<s> However , ideas and concepts like the fresh meat it is health and student will got a much interest in it . <\s>
<s> I strongly disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> The car is a very useful thing which exist nowadays and it can be more cars but cannot be fewer cars in use in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , sciece development . <\s>
<s> Sceince is changing very much in our lives . <\s>
<s> For example we can use emails to connect other people who may live on the other side of the earth , we can use mobile phones to call friend and we can travel to other country by planes . <\s>
<s> Like these examples , the sceince caused alot of changes to our lives that we never even had a thought before . <\s>
<s> So in the future the development will change more cars to give our humans convinients . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , cars in the future will be more than today , but maybe can be seen diffrent from today 's cars . <\s>
<s> The reason is because the fuels we are using today ; the oil , can not be still exist in the future , so maybe we will use other types of fuels to reduce our planet 's pollution and to use cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , people today are thinking about traveling to the other planets because we have been wanted to know how other planets are like and also had been thinking to live other planets , such as ; moon , mercury , mars jupiter and extras . <\s>
<s> So alot of cars will be made to travel to other planet . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , i strongly disagree with the statment that there will be fewer cars than there are today in twenty years . <\s>
<s> As i mentioned before , firstly because of science development ; will development can make more cars . <\s>
<s> Secondly , because the exsistant of cars will be more than today ; the fuels change . <\s>
<s> Thirdly , because of people 's thinking ; to travel to other planets and live in other planet . <\s>
<s> So from these three points i strongly disagree with the statment . <\s>
<s> I am agree with the statemant that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s> To support my opinion I have a series reasons . <\s>
<s> I think that the presentation of a product is the most particular advertisement . <\s>
<s> You imagine a person that go to buy a product and that at the supermarket he has in his front two products that are the same but they are different sealed . <\s>
<s> Of course a person will chose the product with the most beautiful packet even if the qualities of the two products are the same . <\s>
<s> This is an example to demostrate how our idea about a product can be influenced by simple factors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that television is the most important advertisement that does to seem a product much better than it really is . <\s>
<s> It is incredible how television influences the think of the people about a product . <\s>
<s> I have many friends that stated that they purchase only products that they view at the TV . <\s>
<s> They think that if a product is merchandised at the TV there is a good reason . <\s>
<s> This is true in some case but it is completely false in others . <\s>
<s> I think that it is necessary to valuate a product in all its characteristics and only after that to judge its qualities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However people have not time and in some case the knowledge to do all this work to valuate a product . <\s>
<s> So they buy the product that usually view at the television . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Enterprises do their interersts and out of dubts this is correct to merchandise a product . <\s>
<s> So enterprises do their game but customers would do attention at the real qualities of a product . <\s>
<s> In my opinion a lot of advertisement increase the desire of particular things in people and then it seem much better than another that are equal . <\s>
<s> Such as shoes , there are some brand of shoes that make an advertisement by television , journal , and then guys will prefer a specifical brand than others , but there are n't a lot of differences by one or another 's pair of shoes . <\s>
<s> The television play an important role about this topic , all the day on TV we can see a lot of advertisements and our choose can be influenced by this . <\s>
<s> A lot of people watch the TV and generally follow medias and the brands know this and then spent a lot of money for making them visible . <\s>
<s> Sometimes if I am skilled about the thing ( such as computers , cars ... ) <\s>
<s> I can be aware that another unadvertise brand can be more efficiently , can be better , can have more quality than what I 've seen on TV , and this enforce the topic . <\s>
<s> When a brand spent some money for make it 's advertise on TV the price of his products raise but not necessarly raise also the quality , but a lot of people buy him without knows the effectively quality , only because they have seem him on TV or others media . <\s>
<s> The charateristics of a product can be the same ( or less ) than another but if a product have a specifical sign on it will be more desiderable . <\s>
<s> Many times the person who buy an advertise object can be not very happy of his article simply because will see another brands with more better charateristics than him . <\s>
<s> The advertise can be not exhaustive and can confuse the buyers , it making the product more better than it is really . <\s>
<s> The people that do n't interest about the effective quality of products that them buy often are unhappy because they spent so much and have a lower quality product . <\s>
<s> In twenty yers we will live in a different world in which we will have completly avoided pollution by wasting less natural resources as possible . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , we have already experimented successfully the methods to reach this aim consuming everyday less oil and using more bicycles and pubblic transports . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact the cost of the bus ticket is going down because people is starting again to consider this way of transport as a valid alternative to his own car and as an easiest possibility to save money ( nowadays , the cost of oil is growing too much and , on average , only 2 persons per 5 are available to spend a lot of money for it ) and to avoid to be stuck in the traffic of the city center . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But refusing to drive cars and choose to go to work by foot or to reach university by bicycles is also a good motivation to keep in haelth and to do an everyday-life gym without spending any money which can help us to mantain younger and good-looking as long as possible in order to teach our children or grand children to respect nature and to improve our physical attitude simply by using an alternative transport to cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact , cars ( as we are used to think of them ) are doomed to be fewer because we will improve the prototype for different way to give locomotion to them . <\s>
<s> Recent studies have asserted that is possible to make cars working by involving hydrogene insted of oil and it could pollute and cost ever less than a traditional car . <\s>
<s> So , I am sure that cars in twenty years will disappear and we will be able to support the missing of alternative transports better because technology is working to give us the best of itself in order to improve the quality of our life . <\s>
<s> The humankind always need to education therefore education is the very important aspect of human life to reach high life standards . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts are most important part of education . <\s>
<s> Some assumed that it is the most important for students to understand ideas and concepsts in controray to this some think that the best for the students to learn facts . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with the first idea . <\s>
<s> These are my following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason for my belief is that , the students must learn the ideas first . <\s>
<s> Because the ideas are important and also the concepts . <\s>
<s> Students must give pay attention the ideas and concepts than the facts . <\s>
<s> If a students learn the ideas and the concepts the student can learn the facts by time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason for my belief is that , the facts are not important exactly . <\s>
<s> Because the ideas make the shape to the facts . <\s>
<s> So the its concept is important so it is related with the ideas . <\s>
<s> If the student learn the ideas first he or she can prepare the fact before and he or she can look the fact in different ways . <\s>
<s> This is the important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other hand the facts are the important some times to look the objects truely . <\s>
<s> Some think and say this students must learn facts first to prevent him or her to the lies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For all these reasons i therefore believe that , It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . <\s>
<s> This idea is related with both give a shape to facts and prepare to the facts before . <\s>
<s> The long and the short of it is that the ideas and the concepts are more important than facts . <\s>
<s> I hope the students do n't disregard what i mentioned ! <\s>
<s> These statement made me think a bit more time because I disagree and agree with it at the same time . <\s>
<s> I try to explain my opinion about these topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the one hand , I agree with these statement for commercial products . <\s>
<s> Because advertisements are mostly very common way to recognize some of the commercial products to community . <\s>
<s> When you see any product in any advertisement , you always meet good characteristics of the product . <\s>
<s> Any advertisement do not mention about any negative characteristic of the product . <\s>
<s> if you try to sell some product you must say the good characteristics of the product . <\s>
<s> If you explain the some of the wrong or disorder characteristic of the product you can not sell it easly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example when you watch TV you never met any advertisement mention about some side effect of some medicine , some foods , etc . <\s>
<s> Any hamburger restaurant do not any adverticement about how dangerous is feeding with fast foods but we know when we eat much more hamburger we take weigth . <\s>
<s> If we apply morgage to buy a home we can met some bad situation when we do not pay montly bill . <\s>
<s> But any of them do not explain these un nice results of the commercial products . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However on the other hand I disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Because some of the advertisements are for the human services . <\s>
<s> For example : Child care center , nursing home or any hospital , etc . <\s>
<s> These kind of advertisements try to explain the programs ' facilities , how peole get the services , etc . <\s>
<s> Most of the these kind of advertisements give rigth informations to take the attention of consumers who need the services . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the end I can say that advertisements is very effective way to recognize the some commercial products and services . <\s>
<s> But important one take account human well being . <\s>
<s> I think advertisements give us a different image of a product . <\s>
<s> This is possible because advertisements always manage to affect our mind and our imagination through television and newspaper . <\s>
<s> They modify our perception of a product bulding an entire world around a simple object . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When we watch an add on the tv , we never pay attention to what is advertised . <\s>
<s> We are caught by slogans and images . <\s>
<s> Sometimes we do n't even see the product itself being showed . <\s>
<s> So , we just remeber the name of the firm and sometimes the catchy melody that accompanied the add . <\s>
<s> Television usually advertises brands , not products . <\s>
<s> That 's way we may not get a proper idea of what we are going to buy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In newspapers products are often advertised by movie or sport stars . <\s>
<s> In that case , we stare at the picture of the star and do n't notice the product . <\s>
<s> We associate that good to a character of the show business . <\s>
<s> In this way we do n't care of what we intend to buy , but whom we are going to look like after we bought it . <\s>
<s> We look at images , not goods . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Both pictures and tv commercials are now made by very famous artists . <\s>
<s> We are attracted to the advertisements for themselves . <\s>
<s> It seems to me that the more an advertisement is tempting and promising , the more talent is required to hide the real nature of the object . <\s>
<s> The beauty of an add obscures our idea of the product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisements are aimed to built a web around a product . <\s>
<s> A chain of associations that must influence our behavior as consumers . <\s>
<s> To make us buy something that maybe we are not going to like and enjoy . <\s>
<s> Television , internet and newspapers all offer a great and profitable way to accomplish this goal . <\s>
<s> I think to understand ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> The reason is that to understand ideas and concepts is more creative activities for students . <\s>
<s> When we try to understand the ideas and concepts , we must consider lots of factors of ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> At first we must confirm whose ideas or concepts they are , to add more information to them as the backgrounds . <\s>
<s> Next , we make analyse why they have the ideas or the concepts using aquired background information . <\s>
<s> After these prosesses , we can aproach to the stage to make answers or own opinions . <\s>
<s> To get answers or opinions , students can make discussion with friends , parent , and brothers . <\s>
<s> In additon , they can get some suggestions from their teachers or they also can make investigation using books or internet to add more information . <\s>
<s> I think that these consequent prosesses are very important for students to develop their way of thinking . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In contrast , learning facts does not need such prosseses . <\s>
<s> It is easy to access the fact without any kind of thinking . <\s>
<s> To learn facts , students just sit down on their seats in the class room and just listen to what their teacher says . <\s>
<s> In this case , the information is only given form their teacher to students . <\s>
<s> If students listen to what their teacher says and write down it on their notebook , they can get new knowledge . <\s>
<s> But do they use their brain to consider anything during this behaviour ? <\s>
<s> The answer is no . <\s>
<s> They just listen and move their hand to write . <\s>
<s> These prosesses are not creative and maybe macines can do it completely . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I strongly think to understand ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> I agree to the statement . <\s>
<s> There are considerable advantages and disadvantages to account the statement . <\s>
<s> Only understanding ideas and concepts is something condemning , it sounds not true . <\s>
<s> But learning ideas and concepts along with facts will lead to more interest for students and make their interests amplified . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As the technology is growing at a jet spead the point of learning concepts is increasing than facts . <\s>
<s> For example consider the programing technology used in computers for maintaing its huge databases and processing of it . <\s>
<s> We have number of technologies side by side for processing of data bases . <\s>
<s> Student needs to learn improved technology faster than knowing its facts and hypothetical reasons . <\s>
<s> In order keep pace of the updations one needs to learn more faster and compete with the growing world . <\s>
<s> Students are advised to learn or supposed to learn more concepts in little time to meet the course schedule and timings of examinations . <\s>
<s> So they have to pay more attention on concepts than facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Facts help us to remember the points and theories well . <\s>
<s> For example Albert Einstein inventions and laws , without knowing the facts of laws of newton and many other works of Einstein we may not able to understand their inventions and formulas behind the derivation of those . <\s>
<s> Considering the issues of relativity among the bodies Einstein gave a nice statement and fact , that is -- `` a boy sitting beside a pretty girl for two hours '' counts only for two minutes where as `` sitting on a stove for two minutes `` counts for two hours '' a Comical statement but a Fact . <\s>
<s> Then from that facts Einstein brings the idea of `` relativety between bodies '' . <\s>
<s> So there is a support to learn facts before going to learn concepts . <\s>
<s> Without which the concept doesnt make sense at all . <\s>
<s> Especially when considering the subjects like physics , maths etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So learning ideas and concepts also facts are equally important to a student inorder to establish a control over the subject . <\s>
<s> It is a well-known fact that most people 's purpose in life is to succeed , whether it be at the family , academic or working levels . <\s>
<s> Now the question is whether or not we really need to exceed our current abilities to be considered a successful person . <\s>
<s> In this regard , I think that it would be particularly interesting and relevant to deal with the business world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the one hand , I tend to think that an employee deserves the right to be considered as a successful person to the extent that they previously had to prove educated and motivated enough to meet the employer 's requirements for a specific position within a company . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact , given the level of selection regarding a position of teacher in macroeconomics , I argue that the status of successful person is not to be neglected . <\s>
<s> However , I want to highlight the fact that the applicant is all the more granted recognition in the way that their knowledge is not sufficient in these situations ; indeed , not only is the applicant 's academic background important in the hiring process , but the ability to teach to a given category of students is also to be considered . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , I also think that we could consider the concept of being succesful from a different point of view . <\s>
<s> Indeed , I also agree with the argument according to which successful people try new things and take risk . <\s>
<s> For instance , the latter qualities could enable people to evolve in a company ; why would we have to restrain ourselves while we could take advantage of external opportunities to improve in particular fields . <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , the only risk would be to fail . <\s>
<s> And it is a well-known fact that everyone learns from their past experiences and mistakes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion , it is worth-mentioning that the definition of a successful person is subjective in so far as this concept implies to first define our current abilities and then our objectives in life . <\s>
<s> Successfulness can be considered according to different levels . <\s>
<s> in my view i say that young people enjoy life more than old people do because the young people being at the age of teenage will have have a spicy life which is more colorful and interesting , whre as the life of old will be bored . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> for example if we take a human life he or she will be more active and happy at the age of teenage , because that time body will be in a position to react to every response occuring . <\s>
<s> at younger age the responsibilities are not known to him like the value of money , thinking the future of his children , having greed on many items , this all situations make the him unhappy and bore his life . <\s>
<s> at the younger age we dont have any desires like this just seek the desire of enjoyment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> at younger age there are also problems but compared to older they are less , younger age problems are minor related to his surrounding in schools and colleges . <\s>
<s> younger age people are free from mental tensions and they are free birds . <\s>
<s> older people give all their responsibilities to the younger one after he becoming a family person , so then the younger one feels happy and interesting in solving all the responsibilities given . <\s>
<s> the older wont give up their feelings if younger get suffered due to some reason , they also take the parallely the responsibility of the younger . <\s>
<s> but at the same time if the older get a problem the younger may not take that much serious . <\s>
<s> in general , older people has much love and effection on the younger but reverse it is not true . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> so older people take all the responsibilities of the younger and give happines to them , so i conclude that younger people enyoy a lot in their life then older people . <\s>
<s> and the younger has more colorful life than the older . <\s>
<s> Since students start learning thing in the schools , they have the responsbeality to learn everything they should know ; therefore , students are suppose to understand ideas and concepts more than just knowing the facy . <\s>
<s> There are some reasons why I think students should know ideas and concepts but not just the fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , students that understanding ideas and concepts can learn better and easily get interesting in that subject . <\s>
<s> For example , once studnets understand the ideas of how math work , they can do the math easier and faster than others who do n't understand the idea . <\s>
<s> Also , if students knows what the concept is in a history event , they can easily get interested in it and even want to know more about it . <\s>
<s> They can actually learn much better than students who do not know what the concept is . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I do n't believe students would learn well if they just learn the facts . <\s>
<s> For instance , many subjects like history , geoeraphey and even science need students to understand their ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> If students do not learn the ideas and concepts they will not be able to good marks on the subjects . <\s>
<s> Further more , if students do not learn the subjexts well , they can easily fail the courses and lost their interests to them either in the history , math , science , and even English calsses . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Based on the two reasons that I mentioned above , I suggest that understanding ideas and concepts does lot more important than only know the facts and it does not matter in any of the subjects . <\s>
<s> Ther are a lot of academic subjects in university which serve to learn we differents and interestings things . <\s>
<s> This diversity gives to the students the choice to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> It 's better to have the choice that not . <\s>
<s> However , i think that it 's better to have broad knowledge in one specific academic subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Indeed , it 's preferable for a student to study one specific subject and specialy one which gives him the hudge to come every day to class to learn , to work hard and it 's pouved that it 's not so easy . <\s>
<s> Everyone searches his own way in the life and wonder if it 's choice is the good . <\s>
<s> In addition , when someone studies one specific subject , he can become an expert in this domaine , someone who can be hire by an important compagnie as a nuclear enginer if he has studied the nuclair , or for a laboratory , as a physicien , if he has studies sciences . <\s>
<s> There a lot of choices , of ways to take . <\s>
<s> It 's depend only of ours wishes and dreams . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other side , everyone , in this world , has his own role . <\s>
<s> In fact , we wait a lot of things of the life that we cannnot do by ourselfs and for ourselfs . <\s>
<s> We need help for other people , we should ask them for help , we cannot live alone , in our own world , for the simple raison taht the world is composed by a lot of people , each of them different from de other , which is called diversity . <\s>
<s> Each one of us should learn one specific subject and by this way , he can help and offer his services to the other . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , study of one specific subject is the best solution to sucesses in life , to fulfill ours dreams . <\s>
<s> Thanks to it , we can be experts in this subjects and learn a lot of interesting things . <\s>
<s> The advertisement world sometimes is bigger than the cuality of the products . <\s>
<s> I have to agree with the statement because the world now a days is based on consuming and selling as much as possiible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fisrt everything comes first right in to the human eye , what looks atractive , new and original is always an eye catcher , and this has been proved , even I am a victim of those atractive things , is something comun and usual to find . <\s>
<s> As examples we have Coca Cola and Pepsi , is obvious they compit with each other and sometimes roughly , it is really a war . <\s>
<s> And here is easy to read a great advertisment campaing <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , becouse of the growth of the world and the technological advances poeple are more often expossed to advertisement , and competition has grown , so the only way of wining is by advertising anything , and as long as it sails is fine for any company who needs advertising . <\s>
<s> Is has been seen in the aspects of beauty , advertisemtn controls the worlds thoughts and minds , because of the amoo8ount and constant information they send , as an exapmle Abercrombie has this message of sexy and the the sailers are all good looking and grat bodys . <\s>
<s> And evidentiially all kind of people wanting this things go and buy there , is theyr way of sailing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third because the people are been bombarded constantly by propaganda , now is not a competition betwen products is betwen the best advertising . <\s>
<s> So now the companys have to figure out how to catch the eye of at least one person , and sicceed with the porpouse states at the propaganda . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But what became a tool , now created a silent war between products and companys that are competion . <\s>
<s> The best advertising wins ; but this leaves sometimes a side the cuality of the products , in many occations we can find that you buy something because of the exterior nad it ends up been junk or a disaster or just what you were not expecting . <\s>
<s> As an example I bought a drink nad it looked good , delicious but the taste was extremely sweet nad gave a head ache . <\s>
<s> So in conclution even a fantastci advertisment can be junk or not really what they are selling . <\s>
<s> Agree or Disagree ? ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When i first read this statement i thought it 's hard for me to choose if i agree or disagree with the following statement . <\s>
<s> After thinking for few minutes , I now know an answer ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I agree and disagree at the same time ! <\s>
<s> I think its good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and at the same time , i think that specializing in a a certain subject is perfect too ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Both conditions have advantages . <\s>
<s> One of the advantages of having broad knowledge in more than one subject is that this knowledge can help you alot in understanding what people say . <\s>
<s> For example , if you are a person who has a broad knowledge in various academic subjects , you will somehow understand a program that talk about politics ! <\s>
<s> But if you were a person that specialized in one specific subject and that subject , for example was Astronomy , it 'll be hard for you to understand a political program ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An advantage for a person that has knowledge in only a specific subject is that this person will have deep information in the subject that they studied . <\s>
<s> For example , a person who specialized in business will have good information and detailed information in this subject . <\s>
<s> In contrast , a person that is not specialized in a specific subject will not know detailed information in a subject like business for example . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are more advantages and disadvantages for both conditions but i just wanted to state these that i actually can think of for now . <\s>
<s> I think that it would be perfect if a person has broad knowledge of various academic subjects as a well as specializing in a certain subject too , but who will actually do that ? ! <\s>
<s> As for me , I really want to but it 's hard !! <\s>
<s> it said that `` young poeple enjoy life more than older people do '' , i dont agree with it . <\s>
<s> there are some of my thoughts about it . <\s>
<s> first of all , old people have more life exprience than young people , the old people can solve the problem in their life easily , however , the young people usually cannot slove it , and feel sad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> second , the young people do not know how to enjoy the life , for example , the young people think that playing computer games in their house is means enjoying life , Yet it make them do not chat with their friends , even their family . <\s>
<s> the young people . <\s>
<s> in the other hand , the old people usually will chat with their friend and do something good for them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> apart from knowing how to enjoy the life , the old people are also having more time and money , as the old people do not need to work , they have a lot of time to enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> yet , the young people need to go to school , and they usually do not have a lot of money . <\s>
<s> so . <\s>
<s> the old people can go to trip around the world and enjoy their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> last but not least , old people can spend more time with their lover , but the young can not spend that much time with their lover . <\s>
<s> to sum up , old people enjoy life more than young people because they have more life exprience , more time , more money and they know the means <\s>
<s> If you want to travel , which way would you perfer to ? <\s>
<s> Joining the group in a travel agency by a tour guide or only by yourself ? <\s>
<s> When we face the decision of this selecion , some people would deem theat visting the wounderful landscape by themselves since it will be full of myth and exciting . <\s>
<s> But for me , to be fank , I agree with attending the group . <\s>
<s> Among countless reason which influence the choice , there are 3 conspicuous factors as follows : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason I agree with the statement is that traveling in a group by a helper will afford you more information about the view . <\s>
<s> For example , If you are in Hangzhou which city be famous about the West Lake , the tour guide will tell you more about recource you can not get from book or internet . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second factor can be seen by every person is that the group travelling will bring you more safety . <\s>
<s> The guide will tell you which things you can do in the new place according the local 's custom , how to communicate with the local people . <\s>
<s> Those make you have a peaceful and joyable time . <\s>
<s> If you are not familar with this , something unhappy will happen . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , travelling with guide can save your time and enery in your jouney . <\s>
<s> As we know , we only have limited time to spend our holiday . <\s>
<s> We should have good use of our time in our jouney . <\s>
<s> So , company with the tour guide , you will get the most valueble information about where is the best place you have to see , and how to get the convenience way to get there . <\s>
<s> It gives you the chance to attain the wonderful time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Sure , for some brave people who want seek instinct , or specific experience , traveling alone is not bad way , but you may meet unpredict things that maybe hurt you . <\s>
<s> For most of common people , life is worthy to perish . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In a word , it is quite better way to travel in a group with a tour guide for its safty , fullful experience and saving way . <\s>
<s> Taking accounot of these aspects , we can reach the conclusion . <\s>
<s> I think it depends on the age of the student . <\s>
<s> For young students , like secondary and high school it will be more important to to know about ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Students at this age still at beginning stage or we can say learning state . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> They have learn much more theories to support their opinion in the future . <\s>
<s> Even they may learn from what happening in the history . <\s>
<s> By learning theories , students will think about what will happened in the application of the theory . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> While the older students , at university for example , have to learn more the facts . <\s>
<s> They may create new ideas or concepts from the facts they get . <\s>
<s> Without ideas or concepts , students will not know whether it is right or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older students should apply the theories they get in real life . <\s>
<s> Then , by knowing the results , the new ideas or concepts will come again and create new results . <\s>
<s> This will be worthfull experience for stude For example , they are two kinds of cost in production , fix and variable cost . <\s>
<s> Fix cost should not be change at any sum of productions . <\s>
<s> But when we increase or quantity any certain level , the fix cost will change . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , ideas or concepts and facts support each other . <\s>
<s> Learning from the facts will not be useful without knowing the ideas or concepts . <\s>
<s> Because some of the facts may be come from ideas or concepts . <\s>
<s> The plane can fly is the fact . <\s>
<s> How the plane can fly came from the concept of researchers in their good calculation when making the plane . <\s>
<s> This response will be writted in two sections . <\s>
<s> The first one will tent to explain why some people try new things and others not . <\s>
<s> The second one will see if one or another way of trying things could be the best one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Probably , people who try things which are new one 's can become more successfull and overall taking risks in trying them . <\s>
<s> But according to us , things are not so separated . <\s>
<s> We can not say that in all the times and in all the countries or area people who try new things are becoming more successfull . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The link that exists between tryning new things and become more successfull is a modern way of live for young people for example . <\s>
<s> Young people do n't want to take risks . <\s>
<s> For us , they only consider things as people say . <\s>
<s> They are not very inventive . <\s>
<s> They follow a one way of life which is not far different than others in a particular environement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second section is about the fact that some of people prefer keeping their habits and others changing them . <\s>
<s> But is there a best way than another ? <\s>
<s> Can we say that all people must try new things and take risks if they want to become more successfull . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can say that people who try new things TENT to be more successfull . <\s>
<s> We can consider that there is a correlation between success and the fact of trying new things and taking risks . <\s>
<s> This successfull way depend on the willingness of people but also the way they were educated . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to us we can not have a moral argument concerning it . <\s>
<s> Everyone is free to choose what he prefers to do . <\s>
<s> For some , risks and novelty will be the truth and for others not which prefers <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' The advertisements are made for help the sells of the products that they are showing . <\s>
<s> The advertisements are made by proffesional people whom has been studying the way to transform a simple like in a necesity . <\s>
<s> They have had created ways to produce and reflect the best caracteristics of the products , and of course do not show or let think about something can be wrong or is not really good , for make the people feel a necesity for more products than they need . <\s>
<s> For many years the advertisements has been created with specific information , colors , pictures ... <\s>
<s> everythig is put and combinated having as a result a machine maker of necesities based on likes , desires and hopes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advertisements are showed by many ways , from the most common and popular Television , till the most sofisticate Internet and movil phone . <\s>
<s> They have to be around and close to the public that they are made for . <\s>
<s> This can be done by schedules . <\s>
<s> For example if the product is for babys and kids the advertisements will have place on Television by the time the school time ends every day . <\s>
<s> Also they can be in the supermarket in very big spaces , with flourescent color , music , and some times with the characteres from the kids ' favorites cartoons . <\s>
<s> By other hand when the product is for the big guy in home , like dad , the advertisements will be showed on weekends or some times during the weekdays late at night . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advertisements have a good razon for exist , when they make what are they made for . <\s>
<s> Some advertisements try to sell , other give infomation or can be asking for help . <\s>
<s> You can see some others that may seem like have nothing to do , but this is because they are made for no one of the grups that you can be on , but they still been doing a specific work , look next to you , it may be working with your family members . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is not way for say that I do n't believe that most of advertisements help products seem much better than they are in real . <\s>
<s> This works , and it works good . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> There can be various types of travel . <\s>
<s> I think the best way to travel is to go around alone and to operate the travel schedule for oneself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , we should choose travel whether to go alone or to e in group by its purpose of travel . <\s>
<s> When we research a policy , visit official agencies and participate international exchange program or conference , to travel in a group is more effective . <\s>
<s> But , when we travel for refreshment and leisure , we had better travel alone . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , traveling in group by a tour guide prohibits from choosing the time and place to go . <\s>
<s> People in a group have a different preference to the time and place to visit and knowledge about history and background about the tour course . <\s>
<s> Though a tour guide makes schedule , it dose n't reflect everyone 's need and want . <\s>
<s> For example , when I have been to Great Britain in a group by a tour guide , I had very few time to visit British Museum and much time to go about many parks . <\s>
<s> Though I want to have some more time in musium , I just could 2 parts of the musium . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , traveling in a group by a tour guide never can give the meaning of travel itself . <\s>
<s> I want to travel not only for visiting new places , but also for meeting myself and people living in other people . <\s>
<s> When traveling in a group , I have liitle time to see and meet myself and other people and have to follow fast my group and time schedule . <\s>
<s> So when I had a research trip in a group to Japan , I asked to have free time for 3 hours and visited the university campus where my passed grandfather had graduated . <\s>
<s> It gave a chance to meet Japanese people and myfamily and myself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Travel alone give <\s>
<s> Humans tend to blame things , they often look for things that they can not see , but that does not help that much sometimes . <\s>
<s> `` Advertisements make products seem much better than really are. '' is a product of this action . <\s>
<s> It is also a popular but wrong opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , if it is true why do not we act against it . <\s>
<s> If it is so then it is a lie or maybe a trap . <\s>
<s> Well if they sell you a broken item what if the difference . <\s>
<s> There is no difference they sell you a different item than the one in the advertisement , therefore they can get sued . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , there is no point in fake advertising . <\s>
<s> If they sell a product that way they lose their credibility and that is way to bad . <\s>
<s> For example , a company sold 100000 units of a product with some fake advertisement , but by the time their next product the public get clever and even if it is a great product they will not buy it and that is way more important than 100000 sales of the previous item . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , if they can sell stuff that way why do they collect and replace their faulty product . <\s>
<s> It is like selling two items with half-price . <\s>
<s> For example , two years ago Sony sold their new slim Playstations with faulty adaptors but after they realized their mistake they changed every adaptor with the new ones . <\s>
<s> They did that because credibility matters and fake advertisements kill credibility . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result all of that we can say advertisements do not show the products better than they really are because companies are afraid of losing credibility and getting sued . <\s>
<s> Trust or not to the Ads <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As the technology has improved so far , we have a wide range opportunities to get what we need or what we would like to buy with the help of the shopping sites in the Internet or on Tv by simply selecting the most attractive ads but are they really the same as they are shown on the screen ! ? <\s>
<s> This is questionable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the main idea in advertisement world is to attract the people by putting the product 's ads to the market in an exxagrating way , and so they make profits . <\s>
<s> To illustrate , there are ads on tv that says if you wear our new brand tights you will definitely be how you like to look . <\s>
<s> And the ones who really need to loose weight just believe in that and pay lots of money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , in the internet , mostly product pictures are showned and a description of it is written but when you get it you will be disappointed by the product that you encounter . <\s>
<s> The reason why people choose the shop in net maybe they think they can find wide range price of the same stuff , but the quality of it will not be satisfiying . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I can wholly heartedly say that i agree with the statement that is the products seem much better than really are in most advertisements . <\s>
<s> Only just to make profits . <\s>
<s> People can choose between having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Some people prefer that studying broad knowledge of many academic subjects because learning the academic subject of one specific subject provides narrow knowledge with people . <\s>
<s> However , I strongly prefer that studying the academic subject of one specific academic subjects because it strenthens people 's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it provides people with exciting learing environments . <\s>
<s> Learing many academic subject needs a lot of time . <\s>
<s> Moreover , if some academic in many academic subjects is not interesting to people , then the environment discouages people 's studying ability For example , according to the study by one of the most famous professor Dr. Kim in Republic of Korea , 68.9 % of people like learing one exciting academic subject because it makes people 's good studying circumstances . <\s>
<s> In this sense , I would rather that specializing in one specific subject because it strengthens people 's exciting studying circumstances . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , I would rather studying the academic subject of one specific subject because future occupation needs professional knowledges . <\s>
<s> Our special occupation in the future is generally only one such as teacher , nurse and doctor . <\s>
<s> These occupations have a special technique to do their works . <\s>
<s> For instance , in my case , the computer programmer needs special knowledges such as coding Java languages , C languages and C++ language . <\s>
<s> These knowledge can aquire efficiently only in computer science academic subject . <\s>
<s> In this sense , I would rather that learning the academic subject of one specific academic subjects because future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I definitely prefer that specializing in one specific subject because it intensifies people 's exciting studying environments and future occupation needs professional knowledges in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> The following argumentation is about if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Today everyone dreams about to have a very broad knowledge and wants to know everything , but is it always helpful ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think it is very important to learn or to know a lot of different things , which give you a basic knowledge about how the world works . <\s>
<s> I think that the people have to know that for example in history the important facts like when the first World War was and who Stalin was and where the industrilisation started and so on . <\s>
<s> But in addition people should know about mathematics , geography , their own languages , too . <\s>
<s> I think people should be able to handle with mathematic problems and should know the grammare of their language . <\s>
<s> But it is no use to know from every single subject just a little piece . <\s>
<s> It is better to specialize yourself when you want to work , because work always needs a specific subject . <\s>
<s> For instance when you want to be a professeur for history , you have more to know than only the questions about who was Stalin . <\s>
<s> Than it is important to know that he was a dictator of the ancient Russia and that he wanted to make a communistic area out of the world after marxism . <\s>
<s> If you want to practise a specific work , the result is that you have to specialize you , because you have to know all backgrounds in order to do your best in your work . <\s>
<s> But I think , if you want to communicate with other peoples it is verz embarrasing if you do not know about some usual facts , which are a basic knowledge for everything you do . <\s>
<s> Imagine that a stranger comes to for example Germany ans ask you how many regions Germany have after its reunification and you could not answer him . <\s>
<s> That would be very poor . <\s>
<s> I think everone has to know that Germany has 16 regions . <\s>
<s> That is a fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , all in all I would say first one should know about the basic facts of many academic subjects and than he or she should specialize him or her in one specific subject in order to work later . <\s>
<s> I would do it like this . <\s>
<s> These days , since the transpotation is developed and many people are financially stable , they have lots of opportunities to travel in other countries . <\s>
<s> Of course , there are several ways to trip , however , I personally agree the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , due to the following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , people can get lots of benefits to follow the experienced guide . <\s>
<s> Because they are in the strange country , they do not know the information about famous places , convenient hotels , restarants and so on . <\s>
<s> In addition , the guide can prevent them not to get lost , and any inccidental dangers . <\s>
<s> If a traveler confronts a trouble , the person can use the wary , from the guide . <\s>
<s> In other words , emplying tour guide is useful for travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , people can plan or choose the perfact travel curriculum . <\s>
<s> For example , if a person has not enough time to travel , he or she can get best iternity through the advice from a tour company , and spend time usefully . <\s>
<s> In addition , the peroson can spend less money to trip , because the travel company usually require not costly price . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , group activity is interesting , especially in the newly places . <\s>
<s> People usually meet new people in traveling . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they have chances to be more sociable and make wider human relationships . <\s>
<s> They can also learn and share their opinion about new things each other . <\s>
<s> It is also preciouse experience for individuals . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , traveling with a tour guide offers convenient service , cheaper expense for trip , and more joyable time with other people . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , most people think that personal behavior and private is more important than any other things , but in traveling , from my point of view , it is different . <\s>
<s> i disagree with the statement even thoug i think it is more importan to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Most of the estudents are more concerned about facts because facts can be proved , facts can show you the right and the wrong way to do things . <\s>
<s> When you understand the concepts and ideas is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , i think this is the main reason why students prefere facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> in my opinion tradicional countrys like mine prefered to teach ideas and concepts so tha you can developed as you want , in the other hand more developed contries prefere to teach facts that you can put easally in practice and you dont have to spend time triyng to proved if thing work right or wrong . <\s>
<s> One of the major reason developed contries teach facts is the value of the time , time has become a treasure that you have to improve , time goes fast and cost money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concepts will leave you the main ideas , the estructure the formation , is up to you to thake advantage of this an try to developed an take in to facts of your own experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Facts are really imoportan and if you now how to use them you will have more arguments to deal wiht live <\s>
<s> One day i woke up i heard my dad fighting with my mom for who takes the car and goes to work and the other to go by a cap , from that reason my dad bought to my mom a car so I disagree that will be fewer cars in the coming twenty years . <\s>
<s> Cars is one of the most important thing that people cant live without , without cars people wont be able to go to work or live their life the way they want . <\s>
<s> Cars is the main thing that is making life easier these days . <\s>
<s> There are many reasons why number of cars will not decrease for the coming years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the most important reason is that cars is the object that help someone go to work and get what the family needs . <\s>
<s> First of all , people use cars to go work and do their jobs and get everythin that the family needs also it allows them to do many things they like . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also one of the most important reasons is that the car helps from moving from place to another . <\s>
<s> Many people needs car for going from their house for example to visit their family . <\s>
<s> After that cars are made for moving from place to place wheither its far or near . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , these days number of cars increased because amny students are graduating from schools and they close the age of 18 and they apply for the license to have a car . <\s>
<s> All people like to drive and mostly teenager . <\s>
<s> These days who turns to the age of 18 applies for the license test and later on they get a car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , i dont think that number of cars will decrease no matter what and through the examples i mentioned cars rate will keep on increasing for the coming days and years . <\s>
<s> The present topic can be well depicted in that broad knowledge can help us to grab our ability in various fields that can help us to know better about different facets . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main thing about having knowledge in different fields can help us to interrelate our opinion to the maximum extent . <\s>
<s> For example Environmental Sciences is an multidisciplinary branch of sciences in which different aspects like air , soil , and the aspects of water can be known . <\s>
<s> In addition the changes that are occuring with in the total atmosphere can be well described or well known . <\s>
<s> In this branch ther can be great interrelationship between one another in many forms or they can show a graet dependency on one another . <\s>
<s> Like wise having knowledge in different academic subjects can help us to react to the the situations that can happen in and around us . <\s>
<s> Having specialition can be helpful in knowing the depths in that particular field but cannot gain the knowledge all though the globe or all around in various fields . <\s>
<s> One can never stick to a particular aspect in life like wise should never stick to aparticular field of study in the name of specialisation . <\s>
<s> Wide range of knowledge can only help any individual to grow to the greater standars in life . <\s>
<s> The knowledge can never be stolen or bargained at times when needed and on the other hand cannot gain knowledge at a shorter period so having a broad knowledge can definitely be the better of the things when related to stick our knowledge in the name of specialisation in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Knowledge can be the source of wealth so having knowledge in different fields of academics can definitely be the better source of wealth . <\s>
<s> Knowledge in various academics can be broadly shared among different varities of individuals . <\s>
<s> Especially knowledge in differnt academic subjects can also help for the better oppourtunities and also can quiet effective . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So having knowledge in many academic subjects can be more worthy than limiting oneself to a particular field of study . <\s>
<s> It is definitely a boon to have knowledge in many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> There is a public controversy nowadays that whether we should decrease our car-use in the following twenty years . <\s>
<s> Differnt people have different views due to their individual angles . <\s>
<s> The people who prefer to drive the car holds the opinion that the industrial development needs transportation by using cars . <\s>
<s> But some person think these vehicle will pollute our environment , so the country should limit to use cars as traffic tools . <\s>
<s> As far as i am concerned , I would absolutely choose the latter opinion . <\s>
<s> I would reason and provide convincing examples to support my viewpoint as follows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The foremost reason we cannot deny is that the whole world 's evironment become worse gradually . <\s>
<s> The industrial development without careful consideration caused problems even worse than we can imagine . <\s>
<s> The whole country overflowed by pollutions like the white pollution , nosie pollution , the air pollution and light pollution . <\s>
<s> And many amout of them are caused by using cars . <\s>
<s> And those pollutions will threat our health . <\s>
<s> Also the increasing cars burn fuels larger than ever before , the energy in the whole world is decrease fastly . <\s>
<s> Maybe in few years , we could not use fuel to move our cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The reason why I casts my preference for cars decreasing is that a lot of specises have already extincted . <\s>
<s> Because they can not accommodate themseleves to the changing living conditions . <\s>
<s> As a undergraduate students majored in life science , I will do something for those living creatures . <\s>
<s> So I hope we can find some other vehicles to take but not cars which will produce toxic output . <\s>
<s> Therefore I always take my short trip by cycling instead of traveling by cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of couses , there are some merits by using cars . <\s>
<s> But the advantages and the disadvantages of using cars are carefully compared . <\s>
<s> We can see clearly that protecting our enviornment outweigh the advantages of using cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , consider all supports pointed above , we can ratinoally see that deceasing the car use is very important of our dailylife . <\s>
<s> In my hometown today , it would be difficult to get home timely after work , since the traffic is so horrible that there is no day without a traffic jam . <\s>
<s> The over amount of cars today should take a big response to the most traffic problems . <\s>
<s> However , I do agree with the statement that hte car number would decrease great in the next twenty years , for the following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , the sense of enviroment protection is growing more popular today . <\s>
<s> We can see a lot of slogans and programmes on TV about the environment protection . <\s>
<s> Besides the way of broadcasting , many other ways are emloyed to get this idea into the mind of people . <\s>
<s> For exmaple , in the last month , my community has held a competition in the knowledge of ways how to protect enviroment . <\s>
<s> A majority of people in my community took part in this competion , from which we not only have learned a lot of knowledge , but also carried a nition to make less polution to our mother land and rivers . <\s>
<s> One demonstrated evidence of this claim is that I began to notice how the car would do ill to the atmosphere , and started to recommend my friend to buy cars with less oil consuming and less gas exhaut . <\s>
<s> In the next twenty years , I believe that most people would take a stong opinion against the car driving , especially against cars with big oil consming amount , so they would prefer to take other vehicles instead of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , with the development of technology and with the bigger budget in the traffic , I hold the opinion confidently that that public traffic would be improved in a great extend . <\s>
<s> For example , the light railcar which is now available in the big cities , such as Shanghai and Beijing would be available to most citizens in cities of China . <\s>
<s> According to my own experience , it is much conveniene and faster than any other traffic vehicles when travelling in the center of cities , including cars . <\s>
<s> Adding with the point that it can carry a huge number of people , light railcar would certainly be a good replacement to cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides , with an eye to the rapid innovation in every aspect of life , there is great possibility that a new kind of vehicle would be produced . <\s>
<s> In conclusion , although now in many places , the number of cars are still increasing in a fast pace , I hold fast to my position that the number of cars would diminished considederably in the next twenty years , with the increase of civility and technology methods . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> My opinion is based upon the following reasons : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , the number of the oppotuinities to contact the communities has been decreasing because of the development of internet or other erectiric device or the increase of hard-working life styles . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , we will finish almost all businesses without facing any person of our communities . <\s>
<s> For example . <\s>
<s> in my childhood . <\s>
<s> security for criminal was regarded as one of the most important role of a commnity . <\s>
<s> However , recently , the security has been thought of as one of the most significant facilities of a house or an apartment themselves . <\s>
<s> I believe most Japanese people depend on the security facilities rather than their communites . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , young people tend to seek for more interesting or stimulaous lives . <\s>
<s> Except for a few arban areas , I believe most young people feel boring in their lives . <\s>
<s> In quest of stimlus , many young people will reject and leave their own commnities . <\s>
<s> \ <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , there is the shortage of effective resorces to provide young people with the imformation on the oppotunities to be asked toward young people to take part in . <\s>
<s> So , if young people are interested in the activities in their commnities , they will not able to use such oppotunities effectivelly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fourth , there is no education on how important people are involved in their communities . <\s>
<s> It is very impotant to contact with their communities because such contacts will bring about the discovery regarding the affairs closest to us and make our life more enjoyable . <\s>
<s> In additon , as I stated belore and has been intensively discussed . <\s>
<s> the relationship between young people and their commnunities are essential to precause criminal affairs or other dangerous things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For these reasons , I agree the above statement . <\s>
<s> I am agree wih the statemant . <\s>
<s> I have three reasons why I 'm support the statement . <\s>
<s> First , it is natural making products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Advertisement is economy . <\s>
<s> So , making products seem much better is nurtural . <\s>
<s> Please imagine . <\s>
<s> For example , food . <\s>
<s> If the advertisement in food do n't look like delicious , Most people will not buy because it seems taste bad . <\s>
<s> Then , economy does n't work . <\s>
<s> Nobady buy it , then , the products disappear . <\s>
<s> The reasn why most people buy the product is influenced in advertisement . <\s>
<s> At least , Japan , most people are influenced by advertisement . <\s>
<s> In fact , I 'm one of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , advertisement is competition between many companies . <\s>
<s> How they can make the people to buy it or How make their products look like good . <\s>
<s> It is true that the product which I bought was bad . <\s>
<s> However , it shows that how the advertisement have big influence . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , you know that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> You shoud remember thet . <\s>
<s> I think making prducts seem much better is bad thing . <\s>
<s> But , above all , it is economy . <\s>
<s> So , we ca n't do anything . <\s>
<s> All we have to do is remember that most advertisements make products much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> When people travel , peopple might have different preferences on the way to travel . <\s>
<s> I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I always like to travel with my plans . <\s>
<s> I believe that the travel planed by myself always makes the travel enjoyable due to three reasones . <\s>
<s> In the travel led by myself , it enables me to decide where I can visit , how long I can stay at the place , and managing those plans make me a great traveler . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As I travel to somewhere , I have to think where I better to go . <\s>
<s> If I want to have a great trip , I have to know some information of the place . <\s>
<s> It is not only about places , but also the weather , transportations and so forth . <\s>
<s> Through those process , I can decide the place to travel and the place will be based on my interests . <\s>
<s> That 's why it might be one of reasones . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During travel , there might happen something different things from my expectation . <\s>
<s> For example , the place , introduced in a travel magazine , might not be really beautiful place than I expected . <\s>
<s> If those accidents occured , I would arrange my plan for the trip . <\s>
<s> I might leave the place and move to next plan . <\s>
<s> In this sence , I can adjust my plan to the situations . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I might like freedom in my travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With whole process to have a trip , I can learn a lot of things that I did not know . <\s>
<s> If I participate a travel with a tour guide , the tour guide will schedule everything . <\s>
<s> Although the travel with a tour guide might be easy and not necessary to plan a lot , I want to learn many information for the trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By those three main reasones , I disagree to the opinion . <\s>
<s> In addition , I prefer a travel led by myself . <\s>
<s> o <\s>
<s> In these days , many people believe that doing what they alrealy taken certain jobs or activities is more beneficial and stable to maintain their making money . <\s>
<s> However , contrary to the popular trend , I strongly believe that trying new things and being a risk-taker is much better than being stationary . <\s>
<s> The rationale behind this is that contacting with new people and having an opportunity to success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , trying innovative things can play a vital role in creating many places to meet various people . <\s>
<s> It is largely because trying the inventive things , such as self-performance on the streets . <\s>
<s> From my experience , I decided an important decision that affects my future life . <\s>
<s> The decision is studying abroad in New York . <\s>
<s> Before determining my direction about going the United Stated , I thought about the futures as well as my friends do . <\s>
<s> In contrast , I finally came the city to study modern education . <\s>
<s> Accordingly I could meet a variety of people who work different and unique jobs . <\s>
<s> Additionally , I am living with African-American person who has five jobs . <\s>
<s> I could learn many cultural differences and adopt this cultual gradually . <\s>
<s> If I had not been for taking a risk through abandoning my routine routes , I could not have met the kinds of person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , Being a risk-taker contributes to catching opportunities to success . <\s>
<s> It is attributed to the fact that being in some places that can be dangerous situation , such as a owner of venture marketing includes advantages and disadvantages . <\s>
<s> However , a considerable amount of statistics have proven that the advantages are outweigh than another . <\s>
<s> The best example of this is my father 's case . <\s>
<s> My father , Mr. Sung , started an own enterprising about manufacturing of paints 6 years ago . <\s>
<s> Many peopel said that the case would be harmful to live and maintain our family 's economic situation . <\s>
<s> However , he continuously struggled to overcome many risky problems . <\s>
<s> Finally , we have got great success . <\s>
<s> If my father had not taken the big adventure , our family would have remained as a level of the poor . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , without the slightest doubt , trying new opportunity is more beneficial than staying stablely . <\s>
<s> The reasons are that connecting with new people and new chances to succeed was provided by taking risks . <\s>
<s> All in all . <\s>
<s> I firmly agree that the saying , `` No pains , no gains . '' <\s>
<s> Taking risk and meeting chances only create success . <\s>
<s> There are some people who voice serious doubts about having broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects and who are prepared to argue with specializing in one subject . <\s>
<s> But , I would have to say that , If I faced with the decision , I would probably chose broad knowledge of many subjects because it is very useful for our social life and our future life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To start with , it is very beneficial for our social life . <\s>
<s> To illustrate , people who know many academic subject trust themselves and it is very important for their whole life . <\s>
<s> Moreover , they can apply a lot of conversations and give their opinions about the issues . <\s>
<s> If people have only one specific subject , they may not give any advice to the people owing to lack of knowledge about a lot of different topics . <\s>
<s> It is obvious that we can not underestimate the benefits of broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , broad knowledge is very important for our future life . <\s>
<s> To put it more simply , if we are familiar a lot of subjects , we can easily find job . <\s>
<s> Namely , all instutions want their workers to know a lot of things . <\s>
<s> In addition , knowing a lot of subjects affect people and we can reach very good positions thanks to our knowledge and also it brings us to find good couple , to have a beatiful family and to earn a lot of money to be happy in our future life . <\s>
<s> Several other examples might be given easily but these will suffice . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , from what has been discussed above , we can clearly draw the conclusion that having broad knowledge of several subjects more beneficial than specializing in one subject . <\s>
<s> Therefore , people attach great importance to be familiar in a lof topics . <\s>
<s> The numbers of the cars increase everyday . <\s>
<s> People who do not have cars buy cars . <\s>
<s> This will be controversial situation in future , the number of cars in twenty years will increase or not . <\s>
<s> Too much cars will cause traffic problem , people will not go their jobs on their time . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today by the improvements in new transportation systems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In future , the underground transportation system is going to improve , as the construction technology is improving . <\s>
<s> It is going to be easier to build new tunnels for the subway in every part of the city . <\s>
<s> The number of the subway station will increase in future . <\s>
<s> As a result , people can travel easily around the city . <\s>
<s> For example , in one station there will be five or more lines , which will have different directions . <\s>
<s> In cities , people prefer to use subways without having park problems , traffic jams , taxes . <\s>
<s> Also , the resources of petreloum is decreasing everyday , so prices are increasing and cars become expensive transportation vehicles . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second reason for not using the cars is going to be the scooters . <\s>
<s> As the improvements made in the electricity engines are applied on the scooters . <\s>
<s> For example , the segate scooter was started to sell in market and people interested in . <\s>
<s> In twenty years people will be using scooters instead of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third tranportation vehicle is plane which causes in the fall of the cars in twenty years . <\s>
<s> As the technology is improving , in future the airplanes will be cheap , easy to fly and small . <\s>
<s> So , people can buy airplanes . <\s>
<s> For eaxmples , airplanes will take off from the roof of houses and land on where the people go . <\s>
<s> Also , airplanes will be much more fast than cars . <\s>
<s> As a result people will travel quickly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , in future there will be alternatives to transportation with cars . <\s>
<s> So , people will prefer new tranportation systems which cause a decline on the number of cars in twenty years . <\s>
<s> Some people have an idea that young people have a lot of time to give hands to their communities . <\s>
<s> However , others think that youngers , these days , do not have enough time to accomodating the communities they are living . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , to young people , time is lack to helping their communites becasue of their educating and more options for spending their free time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , nowadays , many parents believe that education is the most important point to their children . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they make their children concentrate on only studying . <\s>
<s> To be specific , my sister who is high school student spend a lot of time on studying . <\s>
<s> After finishing her class in the school , she go to the English and science institution . <\s>
<s> When she come back to the home , it is always about 11 a'clock in the night . <\s>
<s> As a result , if many younges want to contribute to their communites , they do not have time to care about the helping the communites . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In additon , aroud the young peole , there are many attrative options to spend their time except studying . <\s>
<s> These attractive places interrupt to helping the communities . <\s>
<s> In my city , there are many theaters and amusement parks . <\s>
<s> Also , by developing the Internet , young people often play games and chat with friends in the online . <\s>
<s> For example , my cousin who is 17 yeas old thinks that playing on line game is only a resort to spend his free time , He told to me playing the game is more intersesting than helping his community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In brief , I firmly beleive that now , young peole do not use their time to working at their communites , because their parents let them focus on only their studies . <\s>
<s> As a result , they are extreamly busy . <\s>
<s> Also , if they have a little time , youngers do other things like going to the theaters or other places and playing on line game rather than sharing work for their communities . <\s>
<s> If you are a busy student because of your study , which one will you choose between going to theater to watch exciting movies and working for your community ? <\s>
<s> I do n't agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Before young people start to help the community , they have to grow up bzy themselves . <\s>
<s> First of all it is important for the younger people to care for themselves and their future . <\s>
<s> Nowadays it is not easy for everyone to find good work . <\s>
<s> They have to get good marks in school , before they get the oppertunity to start studing on a university . <\s>
<s> For the rest who do n't want to study it is still hard to find a good work . <\s>
<s> There is a hard competition for a good place to work . <\s>
<s> The young people who already start to study are so busy with the things they have to learn for their exams . <\s>
<s> That they do n't even have time for their family and friends . <\s>
<s> They have to calculate their time before they can do something in their free time . <\s>
<s> The same is for the young people who start to work . <\s>
<s> Some of them have to work more than 38 hour during a week and sometimes thez have to work at the weekend too . <\s>
<s> There is not much time left in the free time to help their communities . <\s>
<s> The young people acting egoitic , because it is their choice what they wanna do in their free time . <\s>
<s> For most of the young people it is more important to spend time with their family and friends . <\s>
<s> Go out with friends and join some partys for example . <\s>
<s> Their hobbies are also an important aspect . <\s>
<s> Nearly all young people do some sports and it takes time to do sport . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One really important aspect is money . <\s>
<s> The young people try to make the best out of their lifes and to earn money is not only important for now , it is important for the future to . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not everybody have rich parents , who can spend all the money for their children . <\s>
<s> That is why a lot of the young people try to find jobs . <\s>
<s> So that they can work during their free time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All these aspects that i show are reasons why young people do not give en <\s>
<s> According to what all government say , that all cars must only be transported from an country to another with in a five years of date of due from the company . <\s>
<s> Every country must make a roule about controlling the number of car that is coming year after year . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every new car that is made , it brings with it more pollution and more traffic to the world . <\s>
<s> The government must have a limit or a regulation to prevent the additions of cars year after a year . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that in five or ten years they will be more fewer cars then there is now , but i do n't think that after twenty years they will be more . <\s>
<s> because technology will prevent it and they will stop using cars . <\s>
<s> They will use new technolgy rather then cars that bring us problems like pollution , car accidents , more traffics , death penalties etc ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the newer world they will find a solution for it , because if not it will be a catastrophe and a disaster . <\s>
<s> Because logically world is not gonna get bigger in twenty years but cars are gonna get much and much more fewer then it can contain . <\s>
<s> I think technology will take place in twenty years from now , it might use plane besides cars or huge escalators through buildings , maybe even escalators underground . <\s>
<s> No one knows what is in the future or what is waiting for us then . <\s>
<s> Life is much harder then we think we ca n't just imagine it with in a few words it much more complicated . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I hope for the best in our future life for all whom gonna participate in it. , and i hope that tecnology will prevent the catastrophy probelm of cars and stop it from growing into the world and multiplying by billions . <\s>
<s> of countity . <\s>
<s> Everyone looks for his best and goods . <\s>
<s> Life is life . <\s>
<s> In the past , people was not having any idea about advertisnment , but today advertisment is mostly provided through media , for example , TV , internet , newspaper , magazines and radio . <\s>
<s> Advertisment is defined as giving an unknowncemt to the people by motiviting them to buy , or to use certine product by different attractive means . <\s>
<s> This essay is going to explain why most advirtisment making the producte seem muh better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people believe that , advertsmetn is bad thing since it is giving wrong information about the product , . <\s>
<s> Moreover , it is also make people to buy unnecessary things . <\s>
<s> Also , it is making people to waste their money for the thing which is no more good . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of the people thinks that advertisment is useful for saling the product and the maximum amount of product which can give interest to the seller . <\s>
<s> Firstly , if advertisment was not put for certain product , people will never hear about it . <\s>
<s> Secondly , it orient people about some thing which they dont know or didn hear about it . <\s>
<s> Thirdly advertisment , is helping people to get what do they want of certine product . <\s>
<s> Forthly , it is giving nice veiw for product and make it easy tobe saled . <\s>
<s> In addisition , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summury , advertisments is useful methods for selling goods and helping people getting what do they want . <\s>
<s> In the future , people should detect new methods of introducing or markting the produt and sale it not only in one country but all over the world . <\s>
<s> It is recommanded that , advirtsing through different kind of media is really beneficial for trading .. <\s>
<s> I believe that , unless produt is good , the markting service will not make it to appear better than they really are . <\s>
<s> I believe young people nowadays do give enough time helping their communities and I do not agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> In this century , the number of elders are increasing continuously . <\s>
<s> By that , it became more important to maintain elders in the community . <\s>
<s> The point is that it is usually those teens and yuong people in 20's who help old ladys on the street or go to nursing house to serve the elders . <\s>
<s> I had volunteered many time with friends to take a walk whth elders who live alone . <\s>
<s> Adults are not doing these works saying that they are tired of work or they do not have much time to do so . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Adults are also using young people to do additional works . <\s>
<s> School teachers are a commom example of this situation . <\s>
<s> Teachers order students to pull out grass and pick out small stones out of school gardens after school . <\s>
<s> I rather believe that adults are the one that does not try to help their community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I also saw many young people volunteer on their own and they were willing to do it . <\s>
<s> In Korea , young people work as helpers at subway stations and mostly at the nursing house . <\s>
<s> They also go to police stations or post office to clean up the place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As universities are putting a rule on additional scores to those who volunteered for the community , more youngs now have chance than past . <\s>
<s> Accordingly , more people will try to help the community . <\s>
<s> Although it is not an active way , it is good to the community considering that adults are busy working and there is not much people to work for community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For the reasons and examples above , I disagree with the statement and young people put enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> However , I think there needs to be more improvement to both adluts and youngs to actively help their communities . <\s>
<s> I agree to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than from facts . <\s>
<s> The meaning of understanding the ideas is thinking about the concept . <\s>
<s> the three quwestions will arise while thinking that is while understanding ideas and conceptsthey are why , what , how . <\s>
<s> what the concept is how the concept arosed and what is the main theme of the concept same as that in the case of ideas too Here the main aspect in understanding is moving into the deeper meaning of the idea or concept and understanding about the concept it will make the things easier when studied by understanding ideas and concept it will remain in brain for a long time than it is studied According to the studies it has been concluded that most of the students who understand the concept can remember for a long time than we study the facts by understanding the cocnept we can get knowledge about the topic in two ways one is the positive results and the other the negative results from the concept . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> After analysing the concept we too can chosse the bet way if it is applicable in the real time apects too . <\s>
<s> the means of understanding the ideas and concepts is to make the studentsto get good knowledge on the concept There are many aspects in supporting the issue that understanding ideas and concepts is good for students . <\s>
<s> firstly the students can get the whole idea nof the concept they can get full knowledge of the concept . <\s>
<s> secondly they can get the reasons in supporting or opposing the concept . <\s>
<s> finally they can use it in the case of the realistic applications if it is applicable . <\s>
<s> the facts also make the students to learn more about the topic but when compared by understanding ideas and concepts knowledge isgained greatly than studying the facts as it is . <\s>
<s> the meance of understanding the concepts may lead to think about new ideas too which can improve the past there is a possibillty which can destroy the past ideas too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> so finally it has been concluded that understanding the concepts and ideas will show more effective than learning the facts . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement which indeed results in the students future and this is important for the students that understanding ideas and concepts is more important that it to learn fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to my concern i will say that if a student is perfect or atleast having the basic idea of what he is intrested then he will be the eligible person to learn the fact , it may be any thing like studying about archietecture or concern about sports and intrest in discoveries or else studying about a computer programming all this type of qualities are need to know about their faults and advantages and when a student is enough to learn then should learn facts on their particular stream . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I agree only if a student is having particular qualities not like a child coming to u and asks u to teach me computer programming it just cannot happen in every situation and when a student without having any concern of playing the gittar and he just want 's to give a play on his concern of intrest than if u allow him it will be a great problem , similarly many such kind of situations are there which just cannot lead learn facts it should be a step by step process then only he will acheive the concept in his intrest . <\s>
<s> Other kind of situation which i intend to present in my essay is if some students who are intrested in many thing and will achieve the greater heights are those only who work hard and they learn through step by step process only but the have practiced a lot which inturn produced them to reach victories , it not like that if a child learning the concept of addition in his maths subject and sudenly when he looked his elder brothers notes and want to intend to solve division concept which is at that movement difficut for a child but when he studies step by step he will be th eliglble person who can achieve facts quickly but not knowing the ideas of the particular subject or view . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So according to me i belive that every student should have particular idea in the field of their willingness without any idea their is nothing to have a particular learning , what ever it might be but the student should have some knowlege regarding that <\s>
<s> Education is a very important and vital throughout the world . <\s>
<s> But unfortunately there many obstacles for students to go on the right way when they begin to learn . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Educational systems in countries have different kind of aspects and different kind of qualifications around the world . <\s>
<s> For example in some countries finishing the classes and exams are so important for students than any other objective so the first aim is to pass the exam and the possible way for this is to memorize the concepts and formulas . <\s>
<s> In addition students are generally looking for the previous examples amd questions which help them to pass . <\s>
<s> Generally the meaning of education is that when you can pass the exams than you are prosperous Only a few are curious about the facts that are the reasons for these formulas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In contrast in some countries there are really good indicators for prosperity . <\s>
<s> In other say students are diverted into searching the facts they are told that searching the resanos are more important than the results by these information informers are really the pioneers for development . <\s>
<s> Devolopment is really possible with the facts or with reasons that lie behind the concepts . <\s>
<s> For instance think about the science the reasons and facts are really very important especially when you are a doctor and your main aim is to help people in their operations so to know the fact is necessary for the right and fair act . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up in my opinion it is generally more important for students to understant the ideas than to understand the facts which lay behind the informations . <\s>
<s> Awards are generally based on the endings so people are generally concentrated with the outcomes so at this point concepts must be learned firstly . <\s>
<s> I would disagree with this statement for many reasons , main reasons that are to be explained in the following essay . <\s>
<s> First of all , I believe that concepts and ideas are barely understandable if there is no fact to illustrate them whatsoever . <\s>
<s> Indeed , let 's take Pavlov 's animals conditionning concept saying that you could make anyone make anything simply by making him repeating the task that you want him to achieve everyday , several times a day . <\s>
<s> Well without his experiments , you could n't think that it 's actually true , however the concept could have made you think that it was applicable to anyone , however , scientists have proven that it 's not this simple , regarding humans in particular . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides , facts allows you to set `` real '' references to your beliefs , references you could keep for the rest of your life . <\s>
<s> This `` real '' part is another drawback that make concepts less important for students . <\s>
<s> Simply because a concept is an overall general idea about one topic or common acknowledgement to something theoritical , it makes it lose its sense to a student 's eyes . <\s>
<s> You need proofs and facts to build your opinion . <\s>
<s> This is what we call the proof by evidence . <\s>
<s> A fact can not be a concept since it 's too singular , however , to me and to many student , a concept is nothing without facts . <\s>
<s> If we talk about the relativity concept established by Albert Einstein few decades ago , it still undergoes a lot of controversy and is still being tried to be broken down . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , according to history , because facts make people moving on more than concepts , they are more important to a student 's eyes . <\s>
<s> For a long time , everybody have been knowing the concept or idea that energy waste could result in serious consequences for our Earth , everybody ignoring it and not taking as seriously as it should have been taken . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , the alarm has been triggered because of facts happening such as weather issues , environment concerns ... <\s>
<s> probably too late . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , facts have proven their efficiency more than concepts , and this is the reason why I truly believe that they are more important than them . <\s>
<s> the issue at hand is about the broad knowledge of many acamedic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> this issue is important for the versatility in any fields of interest . <\s>
<s> in today 's world we need to explore ourselves in a complete manner in our academic career . <\s>
<s> but on the other hand we need to specialize in one particular area also . <\s>
<s> because education demands broad knowledge of everything but the career job demands specialization in one field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> i think both are equally important in a balanced way so , i disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> first , i think my option is preferable because of lack of expertism . <\s>
<s> for example if someone wants to become a manager then he/she needs to have knowledge of subjects like finance , marketing , hr operations , it , etc.but if that person is not having specialize knowledge in one area then he/she will face problems in getting a good job because of lack of expertise knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> second , i think my choice is better because of lack of problem solving ability . <\s>
<s> for example a person has learnt a lot of programming languages like c , c++ , java , . <\s>
<s> net , etc. but he has learnt only the basics or in other words we can say that he had not practice or given attention to one particular langauge , then he/she is going to face lot of problems in a software development of one langauge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> third , i believe that my choice is appropriate because of decision making skills . <\s>
<s> for instance one person has learnt lot of fundamentals about the mba but he has not specialize in one area like finance . <\s>
<s> then he / she cannot take adequate decisions in favour of the organization because of insufficient skills in that area . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally , i would like to say that a mba person or manager is `` jack of all but master of one '' . it means that in today 's world he need have broad knowledge of all areas but expertize in one so that he can take certain decisions in favour of him and the oragnization <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> fianlly , i conclude my choice is correct . <\s>
<s> Nowaday , an increasing number of people like travelling . <\s>
<s> Someone said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because the guide know the place deeply than the travellers , and a group of people will make more funs . <\s>
<s> But others think that travel with one or two people without a tour guide is more comfertable . <\s>
<s> And i 'm one of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , if you have a tour guide and a group of companiers , you will feel not very free . <\s>
<s> Travelling with a tour guide , the plan will be formerly ordered , somethings you want to see a other thing or want to go to another place will not be alloweded . <\s>
<s> You ca n't change the plan . <\s>
<s> But for me , the plan which is ordered by the travel company or the tour guide is not the plan i really like , but i ca n't change , because of the whole groud . <\s>
<s> That makes me feel very upset . <\s>
<s> And a large mount of people will have a large mount of oppinions . <\s>
<s> It 's difficult to recognize the idea . <\s>
<s> And some people will not follow the rules . <\s>
<s> Once i joined a travelling group , but we have to wait for one or two people all the time after visiting some sceneries . <\s>
<s> I felt that 's a waste of my time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , travelling with a group by a tour guide is always very busy , you ca n't visit one thing in a comfertable way , there 's only limited time that you can stay in one place . <\s>
<s> The whole journey is in a quick pace that you ca n't enjoy it . <\s>
<s> And most of the tour guides will let you to some place whice they will get benifits from it . <\s>
<s> But this kind of place really wastes our life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result , as for as i am concerned , i think travelling only will one or two best friend or relatives without a tour guide is more free and comfertable . <\s>
<s> Being successful and happy is the main aim of many people . <\s>
<s> There is an ongoing debate about whether sucess is achieved by trying new things and taking risks rather than only doing what has been known well . <\s>
<s> In my point of view , people who are doing what they are know how to do well have more possibilty to become successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main reason for my point is that there is less uncertainity when people do things they know well . <\s>
<s> Because , when there is uncertainty we may not be sure whether we are on the accurate way or not . <\s>
<s> It is an inevitable factor that in order to be successful , we need to work regularly . <\s>
<s> Under uncertain situations , planning is a very hard task . <\s>
<s> Thanks to the certainty , we can plan our tasks and follow our progress clearly . <\s>
<s> Also , people learn to be more efficient by doing things they know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason for my point is we may only waste our time and money by trying new things . <\s>
<s> According to researches , most of the research and development projects are resulting with failure . <\s>
<s> Instead of trying new things , if we concentrate on what we are doing best , we can oproduce more favorable outcomes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason for my point is dependency of trying new things mostly on luck factor . <\s>
<s> May be some people are lucky to be successful by trying new things . <\s>
<s> But these people are very limited in number . <\s>
<s> We only heard stories about people who took risk and become success in publications . <\s>
<s> What about other people took risk and failed ? <\s>
<s> They confront with the hard face of life . <\s>
<s> Whereas , most of the people who became successful has progressed step by step . <\s>
<s> I think it is not worth to risk my career and living standard in order to be successful . <\s>
<s> I prefer to be successful step by step with countinious working . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , people become successful by doing what they are doing best . <\s>
<s> By doing so , they reduce uncertainy , they can do more clear plans and they achieve step by step . <\s>
<s> Whereas , the other alternative way of being successful is quite dependent on luck and may result in only waste of resources . <\s>
<s> On an economy that is based on the selling of products , going from restaurants , to technology products , to simply grocerys or even real state . <\s>
<s> To try your best to sell a product is understandable . <\s>
<s> And nowing that traditionaly on many parts of the world , people will buy products not by the way they taste , of they work , but by the way they look or simply because that is the `` thing '' to buy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Myself being on the restaurant bussines , i ca n't say that i agree or disagree on advertisements making products seem better than what they are . <\s>
<s> Reason being that i find myself on both sides of the statement . <\s>
<s> I definitly agree that you have to sell a product for what it is , and do n't hide anything , or lie to your customer . <\s>
<s> But how do you do , when you are trying to sell the best product on the world , but it just does not look good enough for people to buy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I identify myself with both sides of the card , on one side , i am the costumer , and i want to buy a product , that do exactly what they do when they shoe it on the adverstisements , i want to go a 5 stars restaurant and get a 5 stars treatment , and a 5 stars food . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other side of the card , i understand , that if you need to sell a product , you have to find the way to make your costumers buy your product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is nothing wrong to try to to be succesful , as long as your advertisements stay as close as possible to the real thing . <\s>
<s> And there is nothing wrong either to ask for what you paid for . <\s>
<s> As long as the costumer understands that sometimes adverstisements are going to picture thing as they are not , people are going to try to push things as they are not . <\s>
<s> Every one try to look for enjoyment in his/her life . <\s>
<s> Enjoyment in life is not easy to earned , and it requiers several things . <\s>
<s> In my own opinion , there are two important requirements to enjoy in your life such as , huge experience , and have your own money . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , those requirements we can found in older people . <\s>
<s> So , i disagree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , older people have more experience than young people . <\s>
<s> Also , if you have alot of experience you will be able to choose the good and more benefit things for you to enjoy . <\s>
<s> Forexample , traveling bring enjoyments when it is empty from the dangerouse things , and to be away from hazardness , you have to have enogh experience . <\s>
<s> Experience is really protect you from dangerous thinga and from hazardness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , older people depend on themselves , and they have their own money . <\s>
<s> So they will be able to know how , where , and when to use and spend their money . <\s>
<s> Also , they will be able to save money for their needs , and they will be aware from loans . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the conclusion , older people are more awake , and they can earn their right and exact enjoyment in their life . <\s>
<s> Moreover , I think it is really important to advice our children about getting the right and good enjoyment in our fabulouse life . <\s>
<s> Enjoyment is diffecult to earned . <\s>
<s> Life comes only once , hence one must enjoy each and every moment in his life , and live without that voice in the back of his mind that says I didnt enjoy his life one as much as i should have had . <\s>
<s> Life is like a flower which has to bloom and which wants to enjoy in the sun . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Youth is the stage in life when one has the time of his life . <\s>
<s> At youth the young man is full of energy , at a tender age he spend most of his time playing with dolls , drawing or anything which amuses him . <\s>
<s> Then in teenage , young people enjoy amongst their friend circle . <\s>
<s> Not only that these young people will try to enjoy each and every time of their life by doing the most absurd things which one cant even ever think of , like me when i was young - Me and my friends would occasionally ring the bells of our neighbours and run away . <\s>
<s> Every one in his life might have done something or the other equally thrilling in their lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you look at it you will mostly believe that ones enjoying days are only during the youth , But who said that old people cannot enjoy ? <\s>
<s> Their lives arent over they still can have fun . <\s>
<s> Take My grandparents for example . <\s>
<s> Just because they are old doesnt mean that they cannot have fun . <\s>
<s> My grandparents still enjoys by visiting place which they couldnt at young age because of education . <\s>
<s> Although i know that due to these illustrations it seems that young people have an edge over the young ones with respect to enjoyement and if i were questioned if `` young people enjoy life more that olden people do '' , then i would say thats a difficuly question my friend , the older people had an equally enjoyed when they themselves were young , similarly to the young ones , i would say enjoyement isnt over for you guys as yet , u have the rest of ur life to live ... <\s>
<s> Many people have asserted that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> Although it would be easy to reject this statement , it 's such a complex one . <\s>
<s> Personally , I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> In the following paragraphs , I 'd like to present some examples to support my points of view . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , a successful person should have the following good qualities : creativity and to do something to the best . <\s>
<s> For example , Edison invented the electric light bulb . <\s>
<s> He tried so many times , and eventually , he succeed . <\s>
<s> Without his tring and breave , we might used candles to light up until now . <\s>
<s> After he invented the electric bulb , he found that the form of the the electricity might be a problem . <\s>
<s> So , he tried direct electric and alternative ealetric , tried to find out which one was suited for today 's usage . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Trying something new is always important for advancing our life . <\s>
<s> So , the people try something new and take the risk could be called successful person . <\s>
<s> For instance , the invented of the computer amd use it to get on the internet . <\s>
<s> Nowaday , computer almost involved in every event , such book ticket , buy clothes , and obtain information . <\s>
<s> Without those man tried to invent computer , we ca n't do those things I have describe above . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> They might be failed , but in my mind , those who could try new things and take risks are the succesful person . <\s>
<s> Althought there is also a arguement in the opposite position to be made on this issue . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , for the reasons I have presented above , I believe my points of view are the most valid . <\s>
<s> I do think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , advertisements have reached such an important and omnipresent place in our everydaylife that they should never lie about a product . <\s>
<s> All is studied to make it attractive , brillant , colourful , nothing is left as a coincidence but I reckon it is overpowerful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It occured many several times that the product was truly disappointing comparing to the advertisement . <\s>
<s> Of course , it depends on what is the matter but very often I came to try new products that were not as `` fabulous '' as they were supposed to be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I spent some money on various things , from CDs to a DVD player , beauty products for my sister or very diverse things , which happened to be smaller than it was said to be , less efficient or to break very easily . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My brother , who is keen on new technologies also tells me how unfaithful an advert can be . <\s>
<s> The quality is below what he expected or the use of the MP3 player , for example , is not as varieted as it was written on the box . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Apart from the high technology , I would tend to say that advertisement does not lie so much about food products . <\s>
<s> Is it because it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it ? <\s>
<s> We can buy a television once within a couple of years , be upset by the product considering we have been interested in it through its advert in priority , it is different from the food advertisements , or the items we regularly need to buy . <\s>
<s> Actually , if it does not satisfy us , consequently we will buy another brand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Obviously it is important to say that it does not happen all the time , with everything , but well , I think that advertisement should not ` pretend ' so much thrilling qualities over a product . <\s>
<s> However I understand it is part of the commercial system , the advert has to focus on the pros of the concerned thing and the greatest it will appear , the higher the sells will be . <\s>
<s> When it comes to having a Klowledge , it has been a controversial issue whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Som people may insist that it is better to have specialize in one specific subject becuase sometime unsure informations make dangerous situations . <\s>
<s> As for me , however , I think having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous for two following reasons : not only it is more practical but also it is helpful when people socialize with others . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , having a various knowledge is kind of practical way . <\s>
<s> People would face some problems which they are not specialized , but even though people are not professor about the subject , at leat if they familiar with the subjects they may can deal with that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , it can help people to socialize with others easier . <\s>
<s> People meet a lot of people while they live . <\s>
<s> And they engage various fields . <\s>
<s> However , when people meet who works in diffrent field , if people know about others fields , they can have talk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , my brother has broad knowledge of many academic subjects . ! <\s>
<s> year ago , he went to trip to China , and he made a lot of friends . <\s>
<s> Because he have various knowldege it was easy to have a conversation with others . <\s>
<s> So he had a great time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All things comsidered , it is not a balck - or - white issue which way is better , i strongly <\s>
<s> I did not agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Actually , I give more value to facts . <\s>
<s> I think without knowing facts , one can not analyze ideas or concepts . <\s>
<s> Then you will only memory , not understand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you really want to learn the ideas and concepts about sth , first you should learn all the facts about it . <\s>
<s> Then you can be ready to understand and discuss both the given ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I understand the reasons behind this . <\s>
<s> As everybody , the students want get good marks without studying hard . <\s>
<s> That why we choose to learn only the things that will be asked to us . <\s>
<s> If they ask to write the ideas and concepts instead of let 's say argue this concept or state whether you approve or disapprove this and that ideas , naturally a student pays no attention to learn the fact . <\s>
<s> Obviously , he or she will prefer to memory the ideas and concepts about a subject and then he or she will get a good mark . <\s>
<s> That 's what I have faced many times when I was at high school . <\s>
<s> This was the first reason actually . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason is that many resources do not cover enough facts , mostly they embraces the results or the consequences . <\s>
<s> There is not a chance to cover all of the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The students choose learn ideas and concept due to the education system . <\s>
<s> They teach us how to memory not to discuss . <\s>
<s> Broad knowledge of many academic subjects than one specific subject is a wonderful thing to have . <\s>
<s> It is every man 's dream but I totally disagree . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The ability to memorize things is a gift from god , and it differs from one person to another . <\s>
<s> Only a small percentage of people in the world are capable of memorizing information of multiple academic subjects with ease , the others who are the majority ca n't do that easially instead they work harder and read for longer hours trying to compensate for the lack of this ability . <\s>
<s> In the other hand the majority of people are capable of focusing or specializing in one specific subject which is again not an easy task to do but still without doupt much easier than broad knowledge of many subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Broad Knowledg of multiple subjects has many disadvantages , apart from being difficult , chances to forget things , make mistakes or confuse one thing to another are very high compared to specific subject knowledge . <\s>
<s> In the other hand , specific knowledge is easy to maintain , low chances of error and perfection is easy to achieve . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I admit that specific knowledge has some disadvantages too , like being boring sometimes and if you do a mistake you will be badly blamed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end , choosing between the two kinds of knowledge depends on the person 's capability and interest . <\s>
<s> Both are really good and helpful to the world we are living in . <\s>
<s> But i am sure that I am not capable of general knowledge and i 'd rather to sepcialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Nowdays , the promotion of the products that the population normally use is made by the different kinds of advertisements , and most of these advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> And since the attention of people is generally called by what is shown , they are therefore called to buy the products shown n the advertisements , and these products are not what they thought . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A person may usually go to buy a product that has just appear and that he or she saw about it on television . <\s>
<s> For example , a new type of shampoo has just appeared , and had been promotioned on tv , and lots of advertisements are all over the city . <\s>
<s> Since is said about this product that a new chemical had been included on the general composition of it , and this chemical will help maintaining the hair , that it would make it growth , and it would make it look better , which means : the best product made by now , whoever person would feel the need of buying it since it would help them , and the advertisements are showing the advantages of buying this new idom ; so , this person buys it and uses it , but it does n't bring the results that she or he waited for , instead , it kind of has the opposite effect , in conclusion , almost nothing of what the advertisement showed was real . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In general , people usually make use of the new idoms promotionated by the different advertisements of them , just because it looks as though they are a better option to buy , and the advertisements make sure of showing off the best features of the product they are promotionating but ignoring some other ones that may make change the opinion of buying the product , so the products look like they are the new revolution , they are something better that they really are , and is the work the advertisements have to do , sell products . <\s>
<s> The thing is that people almost never make sure that the product they are seeing is the same , because they trust all the masive media that show off the products . <\s>
<s> Advertisements shw how everything ges into eyes first . <\s>
<s> Through my experience , I can say that this statement is right . <\s>
<s> Take a math for example , during my high school days , I had to answer lots of questions . <\s>
<s> A math teacher explained the concepts first , and then made us answer questions . <\s>
<s> If I could understand the concepts , it was not difficult to answer the questions . <\s>
<s> So when I studied other subjects such as a chemistry and physics etc . <\s>
<s> I applied same method , that is , understanding the concepst , first . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Here is another example . <\s>
<s> In terms of parenting , especially money related , I think good parents is not the person who can give big money to their children but teach how can make money . <\s>
<s> You might think this is a different story , but it is related to the topic , I think . <\s>
<s> All parents want their children to be succeed and rich . <\s>
<s> But ther are to types of parents . <\s>
<s> One is just tell their children how they made money , and instructs to do something to make money wihout explaning what it is the concepts behind facts . <\s>
<s> Another type wants to explain what is impotant and more eccential . <\s>
<s> They know that facts will change , yet if you can understand the concepts behind the facts , you can improvise to any circumstances . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many young people inherit big money from thier parents , yet for those reason I mentioned above , lots of people do n't maintain their wealth . <\s>
<s> Things is always changing , and I think along with the changing surrounding the facts can be chaged . <\s>
<s> Sucecesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> trying new things and taking risks are the significant parts of the succes ' i completely agree with this idea and my arguments for that point are listed as follows <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , humanbeing has been trying many new things since the initial days of the life this is the source of the improvement , for instance the telephone is invented by graham bell , why ? <\s>
<s> because he was looking for a nwe thing which he needs in his life and it was completely new thing maybe he took risks because it wouldnt be a succesfsful device and after the bell we communication improved and for the present there are mobile phones in our lifes also mobile phone was the new thing before 5 years but now we are looking for some new things .. <\s>
<s> admittedly graham bell is a succesful person because he tried new thing and took risk <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , being stable is like a death , movement is the foundationstone of the world . <\s>
<s> hence the person who doesnt perform anything in his life has to fall down ` for instance foreign languages i have been learnin italian for 2 years , at first it was a new idea for me and i took a risk because of the limited speaking region of italian but i spend many times to learn it and for the present i am working in italian company , i am not sure that if i am succesful person but exactly it effected my carrier . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up ; succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> because they know that the world never stops even is known how to turn arround it . <\s>
<s> I certainly dont agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . <\s>
<s> If a person wants to enjoy his/her life they can enjoy it no matter how old they are . <\s>
<s> Enjoying life doesnt depend on how old a person is , however ; it depends on how the person is . <\s>
<s> being sociable , appreciating what you have , and have the positive way of thinking are all characteristics a person contains but it differs in people , what kind of person they are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Being a sociable person has a major affect on a person . <\s>
<s> If a person dislikes being around people then he wont be able to enjoy life because he/she are not seeing people of different cultures that entertain you . <\s>
<s> This unsociable person would end up being alone not wanting to interact with the outside word . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the major reasons that would make a person enjoy his life is appreciating what he/she has . <\s>
<s> If a person does not do so he would n't be living that of a nice life . <\s>
<s> For ex : If a poor girl is friends with a rich girl and this poor girl wants to wear and have what the rich girl has the that is a big problem because the girl would not be able to afford certain things . <\s>
<s> By not appreciating what she has she would suffer alot and would n't really enjoy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If a person wants to really enjoy life he/she would no matter who he/she really was . <\s>
<s> Sitting around thinking of all the bad things would just depress the person more and more and not allow him/her enjoy there life . <\s>
<s> Therefore a person shoudl just live his/her life and enjoy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion all people would enjoy life no matter how old they are . <\s>
<s> If the person wants to enjoy life then this person would enjoy it no matter what . <\s>
<s> During their all long period of education and graduation , students are learning many things on different topics and are developping many skills . <\s>
<s> That give them the opportunity to improve some of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Is that more important for a student to understand what he is learning , or just to keep things in mind without any explanations or added value ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the one hand , I think that it is essential for a student to understand what is teaching to him for the simple evidence that he will better keep it in mind . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If we take the exemple of an economic classroom , it will be more efficient for the student to understand the concept of `` the liberalism '' for instance by understanding the way it works and its features , than just knowing the fact that this is an economical way in opposition to others as `` sociaism '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But on the other hand , it sometimes difficult for a student to understand every aspect of an idea or a concept . <\s>
<s> This made the fact that some student are tough in an area and weak in an other one . <\s>
<s> In this case it would be a better way for the student just to learn his class without any more understanding , just like a robot . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My personal exemple can be releated through the phylosophy classrooms I had im college . <\s>
<s> I was defenetly weak on this area and the only profitable way for me to get a not too bad resul at the exam was to learn facts and to prevent myself to write extra-explanations that I did not really understand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , I will say that it is of course essential to understand the ideas and concepts given through our schoolar education , but that we are not necessarly aware to all the fields and some are so harder to learn depper in or improve . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can introduce here the concept of natural selection which drive people to some fields of studying and some others to opposite areas ... <\s>
<s> In the world of today a lot of companies make an often exagerated use of advertisements , throught the mass-medias or pamphlets , to sponsorize their products , in order to bring the people over to buy them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I generally think that products we can find in advertisements are not actually much better than they really are , because the idea of the product that we have is too closed to the image of the product that the companies want to spread among the people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From my point of view , actually the advertisemets give away an ideal image of the product that does not reflect the reality and the true essence of it . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of example to support this my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A common example can be found in the spots on television . <\s>
<s> There are lots of advertisement that suggest to buy a product , like gel for shaving , using a male character surrounded by very good-looking girls , about which the people think that the use of the product can change them is succesful individuals like the man in the spot . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other example are food products that seem much better in taste than other food brands because they are represented as healty products , while in the reality they are the same of the others about the nutritional aspects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I personally was deceived by one of this advertisements : i thought to have bought a product , like a cream for the face , that seemed to be better than the others because in the advertisements was announced to be very common , succesfull and one of a kind in his category between the people , but in the end it was the same of the other products , by the fact that was merely a cream with no special or particular ingredientes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So i agree with the fact that most advertisements make products appear better than they really are <\s>
<s> The world now is full cars . <\s>
<s> Actually it is beleived that the number of cars now exceed the number of built houses . <\s>
<s> So is this situation about to end at least in the next twenty years ? <\s>
<s> In twenty years from now I do n't think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are now . <\s>
<s> I beleive this is true for many reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The First reason is that developing or obtaining any vehicle or tool replacing the car either in size or in price will require a long period of time actually much longer than twenty years , besides it will cost a lot of money so the replacing thing wo n't be cheap and most of the ordinary people wo n't be able to afford it so they 'll prefer to buy cars instead . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The Second reason behind my thought is that car prices are now decreasing , most of the people now have cars actually not only one car but many cars , For example , If I am in anybody 's place why would I replace a car that does'nt cost me a lot with another thing that is still new and will actually cost me a lot of money ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The Third reason is that one of the main problems caused by cars nowdays is on it 's way to be solved within very few years . <\s>
<s> This problem is the pollution caused by the consumption of the car fuel . <\s>
<s> I 'm saying that beacuse research is being done now to find a replacement for fuel , that 's because we need a more cleaner replacement so as not to pollute the air , Also because the world is running out of fuel and the cost of searching for and extracting the remaining fuel is very high if compared to the cost of developing a replacement for fuel . <\s>
<s> An example to support what I 'm saying is that recently a car was invented that works with heat energy . <\s>
<s> Another one also was invented that works with water . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The reasons stated above were the reasons that made me think that in twenty years there wo n't be fewer cars than there are today . <\s>
<s> Some people hold the opinion that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is superior to the best way to travel is in a group without a tour guide in many ways . <\s>
<s> Others , however . <\s>
<s> Contradict the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , and I would agree because I think travel with tour guide has more advantages . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are numerous reasons why I need tour guide . <\s>
<s> I would in here explain a few of the most important ones . <\s>
<s> The main reason is that tour guide know a lot of knowledges . <\s>
<s> It can be given a concerete example we need some subsitudes but we do n't know where can we buy it . <\s>
<s> In other words , we need tour guide to help us how to solve the problem . <\s>
<s> Another reason why I advocated the attitude of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is that we can save time to do whatever we want to do . <\s>
<s> Take the case of a thing that we want to know which building or somethink is most famous in our tour . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One very strong argument for the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is that tour guide can save our life prevent something danger occour . <\s>
<s> These demonstrate the undeniable fact that we may go to somewhere else and we do n't know the place is unsecure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , choosing the best way to travel is in a group without by a tour guide also has advantage to some extents , like we may go to by ourself and get new explore in that time . <\s>
<s> But all of these factors are contemplated , the advantage of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide carry more weight that those of the best way to travel is in a group without a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From what has been discussed below , we may finally draw the conclusion that I would like the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide because of safty , saving time and get a lots knowledges by tour guide . <\s>
<s> I agree with this that . <\s>
<s> It is really important for students to unbderstand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> It is more difficult thing than learn facts . <\s>
<s> First , they can learn facts anytime , if they wish . <\s>
<s> But how about the ideas or concepts ? <\s>
<s> The answer is it wo n't . <\s>
<s> Because to understand ideas and concepts are n't on the text or online . <\s>
<s> Even the teacher wo n't teach about that . <\s>
<s> And I think the most of the kids does n't know which of these . <\s>
<s> Do you know why ? <\s>
<s> The most oof the parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them . <\s>
<s> But I think it 's wrong . <\s>
<s> If we get the facts and concepts , the children can understand the really really basic part of the things . <\s>
<s> And that makes children interests . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the facts and concepts are more specific thing . <\s>
<s> Every adults thinks , they are difficult for children so the children do n't have to know about that . <\s>
<s> That is not true . <\s>
<s> The truth is the adults do n't know about the facts and concepts . <\s>
<s> That 's why they saying about that . <\s>
<s> They do n't know so the children does n't have to know . <\s>
<s> I think that 's kind of stupid . <\s>
<s> And the adults scare about the kids will learn that something they do n't know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think it is very good thing to know about the facts and concepts . <\s>
<s> I know it 's hard , but if you learn that your world will be change . <\s>
<s> Do n't you think that 's more interesting thing than ljust learning from the text ? <\s>
<s> I think yes . <\s>
<s> So iwant to kids to know about the facts and conceots . <\s>
<s> Then they will interest about the lots of things . <\s>
<s> If all kids interest in facts and concepts the world will be change more interesting thing ever . <\s>
<s> So , if they learn and know about tfacts and concepts they will theach their 's future kids . <\s>
<s> And the world will change . <\s>
<s> I hope that world will be come as soon . <\s>
<s> People , especially common people , often discuss whether it is necessary to try new things and take risks rather than only doning what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> But I strongly believe that succssful people try to new things and undergo risks . <\s>
<s> If it were not for taking harships and trying new things , they have no opportunit to win other competitiors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people generally more bold and painstaking than those who do not . <\s>
<s> As everyone know , this is not the only way of succeeding in doing , but this is one of the most effecitive way of succeding . <\s>
<s> In addition , it can positively contribute to find new ones that gives people a lot of confidence . <\s>
<s> Let 's say that a scientist try to reasearch new things , if he is just the man who just mix other theories that already every people knows . <\s>
<s> He would never be successful in his filed . <\s>
<s> If he tried to find new things and take harship , he would succeed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people also think different way in every time . <\s>
<s> I understand that too much attention paid to new things is negative becasuse it may cause much more cost to do and sweep memebers along , sometimes to the detriment of their original work . <\s>
<s> But the advantages of tinking creatively eclipse the disadvantages . <\s>
<s> For example , people who always think different for winning in the market econnomy can find the fraction between many products . <\s>
<s> So he can beat other competitiors . <\s>
<s> As everyone knows people cannot work to its best ability when there is not new one that enable company to be vigorous as well as company to win in economy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Taking all of things into account , there is no doubt in my mind that if you want to successful people or to win in some fields , you should be not doing what you know how to do well but doing more courageable , painstaking and creative . <\s>
<s> I believe that the young people in nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because that the young people in nowadays does not care about other people around them and only cares about themselves . <\s>
<s> The communities such as , helping senior citizens , donating things such as what you do not need or money needs more people to help them . <\s>
<s> The young peope also have no time because they go out with their friends orthey need to study for t heir own goodness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the young people need to begin to care more about other people than themselves and they should help other people having a lot of difficulties . <\s>
<s> According to the survey , less then 30 % of in age of 15 to 30 are helping communities which means that only 20 % of the population of that country is helping the communites . <\s>
<s> The young people should start helping poor communites soon as possible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , the young people also does not have time to help the communities because that they go out with their friends . <\s>
<s> For the some young people they do not have any time because of theit school work of study . <\s>
<s> However , the young people should help the communites even though they do n't have any time . <\s>
<s> If the people has time to go out with their friends or family , they should help the communities in that time . <\s>
<s> The people who study and says they have no time , they are wrong . <\s>
<s> They do have time to help the poor people . <\s>
<s> For example , they can donate money by using internet but they need to be careful since some internet sites are fake and unofficial . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the young people does not have time to help their communities but they can make the time and help the communities . <\s>
<s> There are only few people helping the poors and others are just saying `` no time '' . <\s>
<s> I believe that the people should help the communites although they have no time . <\s>
<s> The young people should change now from caring themselves to caring other people as well . <\s>
<s> So , the young people really dont have time but it does not mean they can not help their communites . <\s>
<s> I agree with the following statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> When a person wants to learn the facts first he has to have some ideas how he can come to the end point . <\s>
<s> first of all he has to make clear about the concepts he wants to include to reach that destiny . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , if we want to do some project to submit to a professor we have to have some dead time to finish , then we have to concentrate how we can finish that assignment with in the time . <\s>
<s> first we have to create some ideas like which books we have to refer , how we can present that paper , the order of the paper , we have to show to someone who can give us the some more information that can be included , put the paper in clear format and submit the paper . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Factual information may be the true information to learn that before we have to understand what are the hidden ideas and the concepts . <\s>
<s> when we be in a family everyperson tries to reach a fact so easily about others but before going to a conclusion about that person we have to have some idea about his behaviour that is how he talks , how he moves , how he behaves with in the house , then we have make a concept about that person then atlast give the facts about that person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I conclude my passage by saying that every person , for example student should create an idea about which graduation he wants to complete and what courses he is intrested and prepare a concept that what is required for him to complete the graduation . <\s>
<s> take some suggestions , know how difficult it is and then enter in to fact that he wants to end up with that certification of graduation in which he is intrested with joy . <\s>
<s> I totally disagree with this statement . <\s>
<s> I think youg people should make effort to help their communities because they must be one of the members of the communities . <\s>
<s> Firstly I think all people should cooperate with each others . <\s>
<s> Within the community there are many kind of people , such as youg children , adults , or eldery people . <\s>
<s> Many of them are needing help . <\s>
<s> Especially elder people need help . <\s>
<s> Now there are big number of elder people in Japan and there are fewer of those who can assist them . <\s>
<s> Generally many young adults have their kids and they do not have much time to help pthers and many adults have their job and they also have no time to help . <\s>
<s> But how about youg peopele such as university students ? <\s>
<s> They just have paranty of time . <\s>
<s> Of course , I think studying or working part time job must be important , but they should make some time to help elder people and help therir community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second of all if young people help communities they can be learned by others in the same communities . <\s>
<s> If one helps community they have to talk with or have soem rerationship with others . <\s>
<s> Though this process they can learn a lot of things which schools would not provide , such as traditions or old experiences . <\s>
<s> Fow example , when I was in my hometown I sometimes went to a kind of meeting of elder people with my grandmather . <\s>
<s> They talked me or other youg people about some great story based on their experience . <\s>
<s> The oen I was the most impressive was his own experience in the war time . <\s>
<s> Since no youg pepole have experienced the war at all , we should listen to the real stroy by the real person who actually had experienced it . <\s>
<s> Though reading article is good , it would be lack of reality , I think . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For these reason , I think youg people help community and learn form them . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement because one can do everything in his life until he have energy and not but obivious it is more in young generation . '' <\s>
<s> Enegy provides the interest , interest provide the entertainment and entertainment provides the enjoy '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the younger age , man is at the the stage of his life where he can contribute more and more for himself and when thinks about the enjoyement the main duration comes from his young life . <\s>
<s> In young life he first experiences the college life which no one can disagree the best days of anyones life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the young age he earns the money by his own so there is no tension of spending it at the the prelimenery stage until he gets responssibilty so at that time also on becoming self sufficient he enjoy his life than old man can enjoy . <\s>
<s> At the old age the man get dependent because everywhere we can see man works for their childs not for their future and at the old age he thinks to enjoy he cannot expect the money from his child or he feels shy in demanding so keeping all aside he gave up enjoyment and works in day to day routine . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the young age only he feels the spirit of life and does watever he wants but at old age he has to think before taking any risk because he do not have that much power to gain again or work again . <\s>
<s> At the earlier stage that is young age he feels attraction more towards oopsite sex and so does so much funny things to attract them but it does not happen in later stage of life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So the basic conclusion emits from above that one enjoys more in young age as compared to the old age because freshness is the basic requirement to enjoy the valueabale moments of life and that remains only in young age . <\s>
<s> I used to like to go travel and almost my travel was followed a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Even though I was very young I did n't want to having time with a tour guide because it was very uncomprotable for me . <\s>
<s> I actually wanted having only our family . <\s>
<s> So most of time I felt if I grow up in the future , I will go travel by myself . <\s>
<s> Then dreams came ture . <\s>
<s> When I became adult , I went to trip only me and my friend . <\s>
<s> Throught that travel , I realized that traveling by my self is much better to see everywhere and without a guide trip made me a feeling of freedom travel , many experiences , and making new friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I could feel like freedom without a guide because I could visit more many places which is not expensive but more beautiful . <\s>
<s> However , if I go travel with a guide , I can go only limited place and I will not feel trip , I will just take picture in ordet to show eveyone . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , I will get variety experiences . <\s>
<s> If I go to French , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , I can make new overseas friends . <\s>
<s> Actually , many people have language problem , and it could be serious problem . <\s>
<s> However , it could be chance to contect new people . <\s>
<s> If I do n't feel dangerous or scared , I can have a question to native poeple . <\s>
<s> Also it will help me to go more general place , which means native 's usual place , or if my new friends come to my contry , I will help them , either . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In short , I prefer to trip without a tour guide because I do n't want to <\s>
<s> I think it 's probable idea that the use of cars will be decreasing from 2 decades now . <\s>
<s> As we think of the speed of science development , it 's true that most people think the use of cars will be decreasing tremendously . <\s>
<s> Not only the reason of the development of technology , but also the larger exploit of natural resources . <\s>
<s> Besides , there are also some facts which makes people to think like that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We 've often seen the news or Tv about the possibility of flying cars . <\s>
<s> Truely so , in 10 years , most technicians assumes that it would be possible to ride the flying car . <\s>
<s> And from this moment , multitude of people will prefer to having flying cars instead of normal cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , these are not the only reason . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , technicians from the many kind of field worries of the deploring of natural resources . <\s>
<s> To prepare the deploring of natural resources they 're eagar to make substitute resources . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , a few of them are now being used in our daily life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , in 20 years , every single city or rural areas will be developed as a convinient transportation places where it is not essential to ride car to move anywhere . <\s>
<s> Naturally the number of in use of car people would choose the use of more convinient transportation than cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , it 's poplular for all people `` The Well Being '' . <\s>
<s> Many people started to care their health and exercise more harder than ever . <\s>
<s> If this trends goes on for 20 year , for their health , most people will choose to walk or use the convinient transportation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is mutual hopes that most people wants to reduce the number of car users or car numbers not only for the air pollutions or traffic problems , but also to elevate the quality of our life . <\s>
<s> But , there are always exceptions in any cases . <\s>
<s> It would be plausible for people to use their cat who have their car in an emergency or haphazard . <\s>
<s> Also it 's possible people who likes more to use only their car . <\s>
<s> so after 20 years , it would be possible to reduce thenumber of car users and also cars and peole will use their car efficiently . <\s>
<s> As the social grows fast , there are many kinds of social aspects appear . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , young people are likely to work for their society without thinking their own duty . <\s>
<s> I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> First , they cannot receive their minimum wages or not return their money completely . <\s>
<s> Teenagers , they are still young to have their own job and they do not have the ability to perform their working . <\s>
<s> There are many employers who hire premature students and they use their students employees like a servants . <\s>
<s> Students try to do their work best . <\s>
<s> However , when the time they receive their money , employers do not give them any money and they postpone student 's minimum wages . <\s>
<s> ability Second , young people like teenagers are likely to less sleeping so their health conditions becoming really terrible . <\s>
<s> Young people have to sleep enough time because their time is the most important period in their whole lives . <\s>
<s> They need to rest and regulate their health condition . <\s>
<s> However , if they go out and work , it causes many health problems so they do not sleep well at night and exposed many different kinds of disease . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , they cannot do their own duties , so they can not adapt their on going life . <\s>
<s> Teenagers have to do their own tasks and make things accomplished . <\s>
<s> They feel frustrated when they do not have their own work if they throw away their duties and participate their community works . <\s>
<s> They feel very hard to adjust their lives between their daily life and a lot of community works . <\s>
<s> Thus they become losers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , students are the most beautiful when they feel glad about their duties and continue to march for their dreams . <\s>
<s> When they become adults , they can do their job anytime they want to do . <\s>
<s> In general , people prefer to do or participate in something that they already masterise , but taking the opportunnity to start something new can be more relevant . <\s>
<s> That 's what I am going to discuss in the first part . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Currently studying at a university in Paris specialized in Information Technologies and Electronics , I agree that it can be very enriching to take the opportunnity in starting something you never did . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I got this policy for a long time since I entered in this university . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I always try to be aware of the news technologies related in computer science and , then to start using it . <\s>
<s> For instance , I am working on big project for one month now . <\s>
<s> This project can be summarize by creating a software used by agricultor in order to help them to organise their productivity . <\s>
<s> Thought I use the java langage of programmation , I take the initiative to learn by myself a new language called AJAX . <\s>
<s> I never learned it before but I think that it could increase the numbers of the fonctions for the software . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , I rather take a risk in learning this language because I do n't have a lot of time to learn and use it correctly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , as a student in fourth years , I do n't have a lot of time for other extra scholar activities . <\s>
<s> Even If I know that working for a company at the same time of studying will be difficult i do it . <\s>
<s> For instance , the next month , I will develop the new website for a company and develop another one for an organisation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I accepted to work on these project in order to make of course some money to pay my scholarship but also to learn new things . <\s>
<s> Everytime I take the opportunity to enter in a new project and participating very well I always learn more . <\s>
<s> No only on the technical field as programming but also on the human interactivity as communicaton for example . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I approve tis statement and use to encourage my friends in doing itm even I know that I might probably help them . <\s>
<s> New Thing Gives Success <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many people believe that if a person wants to be successful , he/she should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I agree with it . <\s>
<s> Although there are many different definations on the term `` successful people '' , I believe that if a person does not try new things , he/she would never be successful . <\s>
<s> There are many successful people as examples for this statement , such as Albert Enstein and Bill Gates . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Albert Enstein is one of the most famous and revolutionary physists in history . <\s>
<s> What has he done , is used his radicular thought on situation with speed of light to contrast with Sir Isac Newton 's theory , which is called classical physics and contains most basic theoris on forces at that time . <\s>
<s> With this contrast , Albert Enstein established new physical theories . <\s>
<s> By taking a try on new thoughts , Enstein had physical subjects step forward to new generations , and himself became a successful person . <\s>
<s> He has said : `` Imegination is more important than knowledge . '' <\s>
<s> As he said , without this creative thought , physics would never have a progress . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another successful person I want to show here is one of the richest person in current world , whose name is Bill Gates . <\s>
<s> He is the CEO of the biggest software campany , Microsoft . <\s>
<s> With his great sense on the development of computer , he really passes a gate toward bill . <\s>
<s> When he was still in his teen age , computer was really a rare thing . <\s>
<s> Ignors the objection by his classmate , Bill quit Harvert University and takes this new thing , and also risks . <\s>
<s> Of course , if he has continuoued his way in Havert , he may become a nice lawyer . <\s>
<s> However , to him , nice means nothing . <\s>
<s> He does not want to be normal . <\s>
<s> By running personal computer programming business , which is a new task with new risk at that time , he successed . <\s>
<s> Trying new thing gives him rewards much more then any one can image . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not only Albert Enstein and Bill Gates are the successful people who have taken new things and risks , the ways of other successful people like Plank or Schrodinger to success are also trying new things . <\s>
<s> Different people have different ways to success , but successful people always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> Succes is gotten when someone gets a way to live whitout the need of doing difficult things . <\s>
<s> There are many diferences between successful people and unsuccessful people . <\s>
<s> I belive that successful people try new things and take risks because it is the way to learn what could be a good deal an what could be a bad deal . <\s>
<s> This means that successful people does n't only do what they alredy know , but they try to advance and try new things , which are new ideas or maybe few old ideas together . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other and , useccessful people try to do just what they already know how to do , becuse they have fear of failing in their attemptt to succed doin new things which may be concidered risked . <\s>
<s> They belive that doing only what they already know how to do well is the way to succed because they 're sure that in this way they would not fail in their attempt although they already know how to do it well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As example , begining a new business is a risk , because it could have two endings : earn big cuantites of money with that busisness , or become broken . <\s>
<s> This is a risk if you are bigining your succesful life , but one should also keep in mind that whitout risk there is no success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example could be an athlete . <\s>
<s> The athlete has n't been a big athlete since he was born . <\s>
<s> He had to practice , to excercise , to give his or her best to becamo the athlete he or she wanted to be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And if the athlet had never taken the challange of practicing , excercising and giving the bes he or she has he would just be a normal person not know because of his abilities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So successful people take risk , wich are n't always certain , to become the successful person the wanted to be . <\s>
<s> And this is the way to become succesful , I can say that because , you know , whitout risk there is no succed . <\s>
<s> People do things by differents ways . <\s>
<s> Succeful ones try new things and take risks instead of using ways they already know . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement for many reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people used to find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others successsful roads . <\s>
<s> It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of them . <\s>
<s> Because they want proov them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE . <\s>
<s> so they take more and more risks to increase , if they succeed their fame . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition when you are a person who succeed , you have to continue but not to be contented of what you already are . <\s>
<s> Because ther is a hioghly degree of fighting spirit . <\s>
<s> For example , a very successful company of cell communication , which is faced to a new one whose prices are more availabable than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits . <\s>
<s> It is a new popularity and money entrance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All the same , even if having experience and use it is important , test new methods is also good , because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas . <\s>
<s> So there a popular short word : If do not risk , you wil have nothings . <\s>
<s> Successful people are knows as persons who are couragious , fighting , and humble . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Because of all these previewing reasons successful usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> From my point of view it is right . <\s>
<s> Being more successful are important for successful people and they used to choose this way . <\s>
<s> It is a paradix but it also law of the nature . <\s>
<s> But some people only do that . <\s>
<s> everybody has choice . <\s>
<s> When you open your magezines or open your televisions , you will always see some articles or some news which about some successful people in our society . <\s>
<s> Some of them may running businesses well , some of them may doing well in there polictical career . <\s>
<s> Maybe you will have a question that why these people can success . <\s>
<s> For this question , some people may say that these people have the courage to do what other people do n't want to to , and I agree with this idea . <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> New things means new lives , and also , new risks means new awards . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , in the new society new things means new lives . <\s>
<s> Just like all of the inventors in the history , if you want to reach the new point of your lives , you must find out new things to support your career . <\s>
<s> Like Edison found out the light , like the Shakespare created new kinds of article and dramas , and also like Marx who created socalism . <\s>
<s> These people are considered successful people , because they found out or created new things . <\s>
<s> For your lives , new things means new points , new status and new value of your careers . <\s>
<s> So if you want to be a successful person like these famous people in the history , first of or , you should try news things , create new things for the society , not only do some common things in your lives . <\s>
<s> But it 's not the thing if you want to be successful and you also should have the courage to take risks of your choices . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In our lives , risks not only means dangerous , but also means award , just like one person said before , how much you pay , how much you get . <\s>
<s> Like these famous people in the history , they also took the risks or they could not become a successful people . <\s>
<s> For our lives , risks also means awards , means opportunities , means the chance that you get the pay . <\s>
<s> On the world , nothing is free , so if you want you be successful , you must take risks of your choices , take risks of your behaviours . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , at the opposite , if you want to be a successful person , doing new things and take risks are necessary . <\s>
<s> New things means new lives and new beginning , and risks refers to the awards you will get . <\s>
<s> I ca n't help thinking that people who take risks have to be rewarded . <\s>
<s> But there are all the same numerous limits at this judgement . <\s>
<s> First , I am convinced that when a person takes risks , she must be aware of the dangers of a possible failure . <\s>
<s> When that person knows these dangers , I feel that if she achieves what she wanted , she is rewarded for numerous endeavours she did . <\s>
<s> For instance , when a man or a woman decides to open a store or a restaurant , he or she does not know the success of it . <\s>
<s> If this person works hard in order to improve his or her way of life , it is normal that his or her situation changes positively . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , ambitious people can employ other people and help the society to fight against the unemployment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In general , good things come to those who have the ambition to change their life . <\s>
<s> However , numerous people make efforts to change their life but they do n't succeed . <\s>
<s> They do n't have the success they hoped and are not rewarded . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What 's more , people who do only what they already know how to do well should be successless than people who take risks , at the conditions that they are aware of what they do . <\s>
<s> We must also take into account the level of risks . <\s>
<s> Indeed , the success may be proportional to the rate of risks , it is tantamount to saying that people who take more risks should be more rewarded . <\s>
<s> For instance , when a man becomes a manager , he takes more risks than he was a simple employee . <\s>
<s> He earns , therefore , more money than before . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would like to conclude by saying that I agree with this statement because , as I see it , people who take risks should be rewarded . <\s>
<s> However , they must know the consequences of a failure before starting their business . <\s>
<s> In our society advertising has become the morst important aspect of business . <\s>
<s> Anywhere you go , it is possible to find any kind of advertisements that try to convince you to buy anyhting . <\s>
<s> One one side of the street you see that the cheese produced by X is the most delicius and soft you would ever taste . <\s>
<s> The advertisement would be for sure full of colour and happy people on it . <\s>
<s> On the other side you might find another advertisement about the cheese produced by Y , and may be the colour of the poster are less bright than the other , and the people are less actractive . <\s>
<s> So you decide to buy the chees from the company X , but once you open it and you eat a piece of it , it is disgusting and not soft at all . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Obviously you get disappointed : it was not what you were expecting . <\s>
<s> But the envelope was very nice and colourful . <\s>
<s> Some times advertisements promise you miracle : '' buy this wash machine ! <\s>
<s> All your shirts will be perfectly white , even if your child put chocolate and grass on it ! <\s>
<s> You will not have to spend time in ironing , because the washmachine will do it for you ! '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So you spend a fortune to buy something that theoretically should make your life easier , but unfortunately you will soon find out that these were just words . <\s>
<s> Most probably you will have to buy a new stock of T-shirts for your child and spend a lot of time ironing all the cloths . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We know that advertisements make products to seem much better than what they really are , but most probably we want to believe them becasue we would like to have an easier life , less frenetic and dreamfull . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Different companies , same product : they have to attract as many costumers as possible if they want to survive in the jungle of business , so they obviously have to exagerate the qualities of their products . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can not blame them too much , we just have to be careful when we decide to buy something and not choose and item only according to its envelope . <\s>
<s> I have experienced both travel in a group led by a tour guide and travel by myself . <\s>
<s> Some poeple think that travel in group with tour guide is better than travel without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> While , others have opposite idea . <\s>
<s> I agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a gruop led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Because this is the most safe way and enjoyable way for travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason that I agree this statement is because we all want to have a safe travel . <\s>
<s> It is dengulous that you do not really understant the cultures or lendgrages where you travel . <\s>
<s> I read a news that some Chinesses travel to Malysia without leding by a tour guide , they have been sent to jail because they played ganbo in the hotel room . <\s>
<s> Some things are not be a problem in our own controy does not means that is no problem in others either . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I think that having a tour guide is the most safe way for travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason that I think that travel in a group is better idea is because we do not have to worry about : has the hotel booking confirmed ? <\s>
<s> or where I can take bus for the place that I want to go ? <\s>
<s> All you have to do is just follow the tour guides . <\s>
<s> Because of they ecperience , I believe that they know better than I do about the cities that I visit . <\s>
<s> Like where have good shippingmalls or restaruants . <\s>
<s> I like to follow the tour guides and listen to them explain the history of the city or other interesting stories . <\s>
<s> This is also a advertage that you do not have by travel along . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although there are some advertages of travel by along such as not time limite or no shchedule needs to follow . <\s>
<s> However , The advertages of travel in a group are more obvious than travel along . <\s>
<s> In conculsion , travel by follow some one who has experience is the best way for travel . <\s>
<s> Expecially the place that you have never been . <\s>
<s> So than we can ttotally enjoy our vacation . <\s>
<s> Since different people have different life activities and styles , It is really difficult to generalize if youg people enjoy life more that older people do . <\s>
<s> However , from my experience , I think that older people enjoy life more than ypung poeple do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , many young people do n't have freedom while the olders do . <\s>
<s> For instance , they have to belong to schools to ged education , and they have to study seriously every day as long as they want to get a blight future which is essentially to get a good salary job and family . <\s>
<s> To study is one of the most stressful activities they experience . <\s>
<s> on the other hand , it is more likely for the olders to forcus their lives on what they really want to do such as hiking and traveling . <\s>
<s> for instance , I am a college students so that I do not have time to spend for my hobbies such as rockclimbing and swiming in the semester . <\s>
<s> and I envy older people who enjoy riding a bike . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> secondly , teenagers tend to have difficulties to establish a good relationships with others and have other serious distress such as family probrems . <\s>
<s> This actually make many of them commit suiside . <\s>
<s> young people tend to depend on their parents so that they do n't have any abillity to change their lives . <\s>
<s> as a consequence , it is more difficult for younger people to have time to enjoy their lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally , young people do n't have good economical or finacial establsiment so that they tend to have money problems while older people do . <\s>
<s> To have joyful time , money is essence . <\s>
<s> if you do n't have enough money , I connot enjoy you life . <\s>
<s> therefore , older people have more time to enjoy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Each peason has different life in different age so that it is not possilble to detrermine whether young people enjoy life more that older people do . <\s>
<s> However , again , older people have more opportunities to have time to enjoy their lives , according to my experience . <\s>
<s> `` Understanding gives you a better clarity and vision rather than learning facts '' , i agree to the point that understanding ideas and concepts has a better results than simply learning it . <\s>
<s> When you are learning the facts , what exactly happens is that if you are not repeating it again and again you tend to forget the concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> In learning you try to memorise the text without looking at it 's practical implemntation and after a period of time it gets vanished . <\s>
<s> learning could be lucrative only when you have to swallow things Like . <\s>
<s> In history , where you have to learn the time and series of events that has happened in past . <\s>
<s> But in creative and intelectual subjects like . <\s>
<s> Science , Arts , Mathematics it is not good to simply learn things because these areas need you to understnad the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In understanding the ideas and concepts yoy use the creative , active and imaginative part of your brain . <\s>
<s> When you understand something you do n't have to push yourself to revise it again . <\s>
<s> Taking `` Mathematics '' as example when you understand the concept geomatry , than only you will be able to use it properly and efficiently . <\s>
<s> Understanding the ideas and concept opens your brain to see every part of the subject . <\s>
<s> and after doing a brainstorm with urself you understands the fact which you never forget . <\s>
<s> Understanding a concept is easier to do than learning it . <\s>
<s> It is often seen that students focus more on learning things than understanding because they have their exams pressure on them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At last i would suggest that the dynamcis of an educational course should emphasis more on giving a better understanding . <\s>
<s> when an individual understand a concept it comes into his behaviour . <\s>
<s> learning is like looking at the ocean from a distance and understanding is more about enjoying the depth of it . <\s>
<s> Fewer cars in twenty years ? <\s>
<s> Do you really think there will be fewer cars in a time of a raising economy ? <\s>
<s> I do n't think so for 3 reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the world has 60 billion peoples and it wo n't stop raise . <\s>
<s> The number of people all over the world will increase . <\s>
<s> The economy will also increase . <\s>
<s> My personal infer is that more people need more cars , and the graphs of the world population supporting my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , people have to be more flexible , it 's a major point in every job . <\s>
<s> In todays jobs for example you have to travel from Berlin to Munich daily . <\s>
<s> You do n't would like to fly because it 's to expensive , so you have to drive . <\s>
<s> In my mind there is a big importance in beeing flexible , therefore you need to have a car . <\s>
<s> If you do n't have one you could easily loose your job . <\s>
<s> Do you like loose your job ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , the car manufacturer are aiming to sell more cars as they are doing right now . <\s>
<s> That 's the goal of every entrepreneur . <\s>
<s> They are doing everything to increase there cars . <\s>
<s> They will design and manufacture new models . <\s>
<s> Perhaps a new brand will start up . <\s>
<s> They are reaching new potential customers in third world countrys . <\s>
<s> So for example Lancia did , they produced very cheap cars for poor people . <\s>
<s> All this leads into a increaing number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I say that it 's nearly impossible to decrease the amount of cars . <\s>
<s> There is only one big problem , the oil ressources , but we have very good scholars to invent new alternative mobiles without the need of oil . <\s>
<s> I am very excited how the future is going on . <\s>
<s> From my perspective , I agreed with the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> The reason that people need to advertise their product it 's because they want to sell more product and try to increase people 's desire of their product . <\s>
<s> Moreover , there are lots of differents complemental products are competing against to each others . <\s>
<s> However , those products are always look better when they are advertising . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are few example that happend to lots of people . <\s>
<s> Have you ever buy a hamburger after you see the advertise of the hamburger form media ? <\s>
<s> The producer of the hamburger makes the hamburger looks so big and so delicious while they are advertising . <\s>
<s> However , when people actually goes to a shop and buy the same hamberger that they have seen form the media , people would find out that the hamburger looks so smaller than the one they saw form the media . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Producers are actually using advertisements to attract people to buy their product . <\s>
<s> In addition , lots of compaines are competing against each others and some companies earnd profits because of they abused the advertisement 's power and earn lots of money by those unreal advertisements . <\s>
<s> For example , Car companies always said their cars are the best and provide a video tape to show how incradible is the car and how amazing is the car , such as a car can drive really fast on icey floor . <\s>
<s> However , when people who actually buy the car , they always find out that the video are not realistic and they will find out that the adverties video was lying . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the reason that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are its because those companies want to earn more money and they also want to show that their product are the best and win the competition between each others in oder to earn lots of profit . <\s>
<s> I agree this opinion and think there are some reasons for it . <\s>
<s> Before I state possible reasons for that , I explain why I think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communmities . <\s>
<s> In my own experience , I did not attend community activity like cleaning or helping older people very much . <\s>
<s> I think it is not only my case but it hold true of other young people around me . <\s>
<s> Therefore I feel this opinoin is true . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then why this happen ? <\s>
<s> It is often said that local community bond was much tigher before and people help each other and give much time to helping thier communities . <\s>
<s> For example , if it is hard for a family to take care of their children or elderly people , other families near the family help them . <\s>
<s> Opposite is also done . <\s>
<s> If there are some problems , local communities helps each other . <\s>
<s> I think it worked well before . <\s>
<s> That is so-called give and take spirit . <\s>
<s> Moreover , there were not TV games or computers , so children played with neibours . <\s>
<s> That helped children to mede friends with other children or communicate other adults members of the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , thesedays such community bond bacame weaker . <\s>
<s> I don not say it does not exsist at all , but few community works well . <\s>
<s> Because society bacame rapid and young people busy with their own work and prefer to do thier own things . <\s>
<s> They lacks time and also lacks effort to join . <\s>
<s> That is a problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore if this tendency continued , it would cycle generation to generation . <\s>
<s> I think we have to see our comunities more and engage in helping . <\s>
<s> In the modern society , many things have change comparing to the past . <\s>
<s> The Korean trdition for hleping other have dissapered but instead we developed a new way of helping our communities . <\s>
<s> So I disagree with the opinion . <\s>
<s> There are three reasons why I dissagree with the opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , the traditional way of helping others have changed into various types . <\s>
<s> For example If you dial a certian number you can donate small amount of money or there was this event I went . <\s>
<s> It 's the program to feel the starvation , uncomfortable house and all the pain that the children in the third world countries are giong through . <\s>
<s> I donated some money and starve for 24hour . <\s>
<s> By doing this I help a child to eat three month of nutritious meal . <\s>
<s> so even though I did not visit a orphanage and did the cleanings and reading children stories I helped my community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the student have nowadays have to serve their community at least 20hours to go to high school or university . <\s>
<s> Many people say that the true meaning of helping other is what comes out from your heart not the grades . <\s>
<s> But because of this system I learn the joyful feeling of helping others . <\s>
<s> After than I did more of the helping community more than the school required and I stared to get involved in many charity groups and jion unicef . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , Because of christianity , many students donate their money when they go to church and participate in activies to help the other in their community . <\s>
<s> For example , my friend goes to church every weekend to give food for the homeless in park . <\s>
<s> It is not only christianity that encourage helping others many kinds of realigion encourage students to serve the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Just because some traditions has chage it does n't mean that the young people do not give enough time to help the others . <\s>
<s> So Because of these three reasons I disagree with the opinion . <\s>
<s> There are many successful people around the world now and if we want to be a successful person , we can learn some things from them . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement which is `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think my father is a successful person because he is a good sample for me all the time . <\s>
<s> He is a doctor in Taiwan and when he was still a kid , he likes to try new things and always interested in the thing that he does not know . <\s>
<s> My grandmother told me a lot of his stories when he is young . <\s>
<s> And when he studied in high school , he already knew that he wants to be a doctor in the future . <\s>
<s> He always got good marks on the test or homework so he did not worried about these things . <\s>
<s> He started to go to some hostipal and see what 's going on in a real place not just in school . <\s>
<s> He thinks this would be useful when he actually work in a hospital . <\s>
<s> After he graduated , he started to learn how to be a doctor and it was much more difficult than study in school . <\s>
<s> He try many nre things such as helping the patiens . <\s>
<s> They only did some practices in the school but not for real patiens so it is very hard for him at the first time . <\s>
<s> But after many years , he can controls everything in his hospital now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My father is a good example because he keep continue to learn new things after he graduated and also take risks . <\s>
<s> If he only did what he already know in the school , he cannot be a successful doctor in the hospital now . <\s>
<s> Therefore I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> I agree with the following statment because the person would have more general knowledge than knowing only about one specific subject and having other subjects are for extra creditation and lead to a more smart and informative student . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> specializing in one specific subject is good because it concentartes on what the student would be willing to do int he future and what he wants he be , thats why he wants to be specialized in one specific topic but it also has a negative effect on the person because then he wont know any other information but only about his specific subject . <\s>
<s> For instance a student wants to specialize in buisness and he takes subjects that only deals with business and nothing more , and when he wants to change his mind it would be very hard for him to change his subjects in the future because he only took for a specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having other academic subjects would help the student to have seek more knowledge and have more information and he would actually be better in his specialized subject from the help of other subjects . <\s>
<s> Specializing in only one subject will then be boring because the student would be working and studying the same subject over and over again in which he wont have other subjects or electives that would be different and give him different information . <\s>
<s> If a student specilaized in one specific subject and then in the end fails that subject then that would be a big loss and after all the student have been through he fails , so if he had different subjects and the subject he wants to take , atleast if he fails in his specialized subject he has other subjects to turn to incase failure occurs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having other academic subjects is better than specializing in one subject for alot of reasons which are negative and positive . <\s>
<s> Fist of all , we need to think about envoirement . <\s>
<s> So my anwer is definitly `` Yes , I agree . '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , everything was very easy and possible because of cars . <\s>
<s> They 're really usefull and convinent . <\s>
<s> And we are already good at that situation . <\s>
<s> This means it will be very difficult us to give up driving cars . <\s>
<s> But we know the first period of life on the earth , people did not die . <\s>
<s> They could live . <\s>
<s> I want to say it could be a habit just for us . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Habits can be change by efforts . <\s>
<s> But the envoirement which was distroyed by human being cannot be recorver . <\s>
<s> I 'm sure about the judgement which we have to choose . <\s>
<s> No one will give up their life . <\s>
<s> But everyone can change their life style for their serious health problems . <\s>
<s> What kinds of thing will be instead of cars ? <\s>
<s> I want to suggest bicycle ! <\s>
<s> For the both of a good envoirement and a health , it 's really good . <\s>
<s> Many people also have good memories which connected with childhood and bicycle ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We have to care about our future <\s>
<s> In my opinion , the statement that successful people try new things and take risks is true . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My believe is that success and new things are closely related . <\s>
<s> I do think so because in my experience I always considered something as a personal success if I was able to overcome old barriers and to reach targets that seemed unlikely to be reached before . <\s>
<s> I feel especially satisfied , if by reaching new targets I have to face risks . <\s>
<s> On the other hand if something is well known to me , I do not feel great satisfaction in achieving it . <\s>
<s> So for me it is part of personal success to try in new things and overcome risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also in a material way I think that it is true that success goes along with trying new things and taking risks . <\s>
<s> There are many examples of great personalities who are regareded successful because they were the first to do certain things . <\s>
<s> For example Lance Armstrong who was the first man on the moon is definetly considered to be a successful man . <\s>
<s> Another example would be a business-man who managed to built up a company that provides unique and new products or services . <\s>
<s> If his company offers usefull stuff and is the first to do so , the chances of being successful are quite high . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , there is also another side of success . <\s>
<s> If someone has certain targets that are not necessarily new or ground-breaking , you can also be successful by reaching these targets . <\s>
<s> You could for example try to play soccer as good as some famous soccer player . <\s>
<s> If you manage to do so , you might be a successful person without achieving a new thing . <\s>
<s> But in my opinion it is more likely to become sucessful by doing something new rather than just to do like others did before . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , even though it is not a necessarity to try new things in order to become successful , I do believe that by doing so you will have a greater chance to become successful in the way you feel about yourself and in the way other people see you . <\s>
<s> People are learning to grow with the basic skills and experience , so it is much more significant for young people to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the facts instead , and the reasons are as the folowings . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , knowing the concepts and ideas can help young people understand the rules of this world and see the common points exist between disinct peope and things , which gives them the basic point of view about the society they live in . <\s>
<s> Besides , most of the facts happen according to the concept and their ideas . <\s>
<s> For instance , the young people are supposed to show respect to the elders in the society as the principles and a nice manner , like the government provide the elders more protection and help in finance and health care each year . <\s>
<s> In this case , everyone regards it as a right and valuable thing to do , so this rule goes on and on . <\s>
<s> The young people know this rule will easily understand the way this society runs and come up with a right and fare opinion about this . <\s>
<s> As a result , knowing the concepts is knowing the world properly and quickly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second is that the so called `` facts '' are enumorous in this world and young people cannot learn them all even in his whole life . <\s>
<s> There are always some spacial cases in each field of facts that will cinfuse the young people who do not know the concepts and ideas of most of the things that happen around him . <\s>
<s> In that way , people is definitly having trouble in understand things and dealing with things they met . <\s>
<s> What is worse , the lack of knowledge of concepts will make the young people lose themselves . <\s>
<s> The facts are the surface of concepts and ideas while the unpridictable facts are waiting for people to find by themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finnally , not knowing the concepts of facts willl give the young people wrong direction for they only learn their life based on things they see , and do not know how to look at them in a proper and objective way . <\s>
<s> This will lead to an bad result and a young student , for instance , will not understand will the criminals are punished while they do not know how people are supposed to behave in this world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , to understand the concepts and ideas are much more important than merely knowing the facts so called . <\s>
<s> Today there are many people that follow their own ideas and they usually have to take risk in some situations . <\s>
<s> But there are other people like to know when they have to do something . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all many people like to take their own opinion when they have to do something , I think that is good fo them . <\s>
<s> But sometimes when people try to new things in their life they have to take some risks . <\s>
<s> For example , My father has a business and when he started in his businees he had to take a lot of risk in the beginner , my father is kind of the person who like to try new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , I have many friends that like to try new things and I think when people try to do something new they use their imagination , also they can create new things in order to be successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , there are people who like to know something in order to do well . <\s>
<s> This kind of people is more safe about their life and they are more careful with themselves . <\s>
<s> In fact , people who do n't like to take risk , they can live better and they can be successful too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , This kind of people like to go at university or college because they prefer to be safe in order to do something well and they never like to take risk in their life . <\s>
<s> But the problem with this this way is that you have to spent many years of study . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I 'm agree wih this both ways because I can be a successful person . <\s>
<s> And this both ways have positives and negatives things . <\s>
<s> Thus , In my opinion If I have to chose one of them I 'll chose to know something in order to do well because I 'll take less risk than the other way . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well becase of creating a chance to be success and possibility of sucess . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , if I am doing what I were already getting used to , I could never get a chace to make a lot of money or to sharply developed by myself because I would think same way and situations . <\s>
<s> When we see a sucessful people , they tried several aspects and a lot of ways with the risks . <\s>
<s> For example , I went to a seminar which Donald Triump opened in New York city two weeks ago , I heard that only people who catch a good idea and chance with risks can be sucessed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , if I try to get new things , I believe I have more percentage of development . <\s>
<s> There is an article pressed by Korea Times in 2006 that introduced a man graduated from Seoul university in Korea with bechelor degree sells a sandwich and Kimbab ( Korean Sushi ) . <\s>
<s> He makes more than $ 100,000 per a year . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , I firmly believe that in order to get new chance and good idea and grow up my possiblity of sucess , I should try new things and creative experiences . <\s>
<s> That is why I agree with that . <\s>
<s> Knowlege is a very important phenomenon . <\s>
<s> It is always says that , someone who carries great knowledge is succesfull in this world . <\s>
<s> Some people say that we should be all-rounder and others say that we should be master of our skill . <\s>
<s> There are lots of thoughts regarding this . <\s>
<s> I think that we should be all rounder . <\s>
<s> In other word , we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the era of high competitions , more available skills , we should have knowledge of various fields . <\s>
<s> In this way we can lead the masters of the various fields . <\s>
<s> For example , if I have to run a company , I must have all the essential information about that company . <\s>
<s> If I have good knowledge about all the aspects of running a company , then only I can handle it . <\s>
<s> As for as speciality is concerned , I am not ignoring it . <\s>
<s> It is also of great importance . <\s>
<s> But we can not be special in various fields at the same time . <\s>
<s> I can hire various specialists to run my company . <\s>
<s> I can gather many mastter at my company to rise in a good manner . <\s>
<s> But , For all these requirement , we should have more and more general knowlege about running a company . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We often see that , at the top of any company , organization or any institution the persons is an all-rounder not a specialist but what is impotant that he a person who has ability to handle all the specialist at a time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , in my openion one should have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> In this way his horizen will be more widen . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> First , in the tour we can make new friends . <\s>
<s> In my case , this summer I went kamikouchi by tour , and then I could make lot of friends . <\s>
<s> Fathremore , I was able to get the information of other tour from the new friends , and next summer I will go with them . <\s>
<s> Second , we can go trip without preparing , even the place we do n't know . <\s>
<s> Forexanple , if we wish to go Egypt and we do n't have any information of Egypt , maybe we can not find the way to go Egypt with own our self . <\s>
<s> But if we join the tour , tour guide will get information for us and introduce lot of place in there . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition I can go trip alone . <\s>
<s> I do not have to find friends who are intrested to the same place . <\s>
<s> All I have to do is choose the place to trip and find the tour to complete my hope . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with the statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . <\s>
<s> In our life , we have a lots of chances to face to the delimma situations . <\s>
<s> Sometime we will follow the indicatation by people who have the same experience and know the best answer . <\s>
<s> However , sometime we just take a chance even we know it might have some risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I support that we should take chance in trying new thinds . <\s>
<s> First and foremost , everyday we will meet numerous of new things . <\s>
<s> If we always just fellowed the rules that were given by others , we would miss a lots of chance to learn things by ourselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , when I was child , i always copy the essay from my sister , because I know she always get high grade than me . <\s>
<s> But after I grew up , I try to write by myself , to my astonished , I found that writting is a such interesting thing . <\s>
<s> Moreover , I can learn new vocabulary and skills from writting . <\s>
<s> If I did not do it by myself , I would never find the fun of writting . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , we will never know the result , it might be good or be bad . <\s>
<s> It is life , is not it ? <\s>
<s> It is more impressed if the results is came from ourselves . <\s>
<s> We can learn from the bad result and never do it again . <\s>
<s> Also remember the good results in mind , next time when we meet the same situation , we know the answer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Futhermore , after trying new things and getting good result , the feeling of satisfy is the most wonderful feeling in the world , Everytime I make a right dicision , I will very proud by myself and talk to everybody to share my joy . <\s>
<s> Even some of my friends wil be encouraged . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think take chance when trying new things carry more weight than doing what they already know how to do . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement , the best way is in a group . <\s>
<s> However , i disagree the travel is led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I think travel in a group has a lot of benefits . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It will be fun than travel alone . <\s>
<s> I think travel alone is so boring . <\s>
<s> If we travel in a group , we can talk when we are going somewhere . <\s>
<s> And we can enjoy the game during the trip . <\s>
<s> But if we travel alone , we ca n't play . <\s>
<s> we wil spend time quitely . <\s>
<s> When we travel , i think fun must be first . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can help each other . <\s>
<s> If someone do n't know something how to do , his or her friend can help him . <\s>
<s> If someone ca n't do something because of other one , his friend can do that instead of him . <\s>
<s> For example , there are firework at night . <\s>
<s> By the way , he is sick or ca n't go out because of his work , then his friends can bring his camera and can take the photo and video for him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I told you that led by a tour guide is not good . <\s>
<s> During the trip , the tour guide explain and teach everything . <\s>
<s> Therefore , getting information is so easy . <\s>
<s> Then we will forget the information easily . <\s>
<s> I think if i get something easily , i also can lose that easily . <\s>
<s> We need to prepare information about the place where we go before we travel . <\s>
<s> It is my experience . <\s>
<s> I prepared information before i went Haha Tower . <\s>
<s> And when i went Haha Tower , i could know about that very well . <\s>
<s> And it was very interesting . <\s>
<s> And you can talk with your friends with that information . <\s>
<s> And you can get more information by your friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By these reasons , i think to travel in a group without a tour guide is the best way . <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I can only support this statement , because one will never be more successfull than others , if one does not try out new thinks . <\s>
<s> And for trying out something new one has to take the risk to fail , or to get hurt . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This implies the fact , that successful people have to be very confident . <\s>
<s> Confidence means in this case to be able to keep your head up and go on , eventhough something did not work . <\s>
<s> Because this is what happes all the time when you risk something , sometimes it might work , sometimes you will fail . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course being successful does not only mean having a big job career , one can be successful in sports , school , family , organizing life ect . <\s>
<s> But in everything you want to succeed you have to be open for new things . <\s>
<s> If you always walk the same path like the others you will never step out off the mass . <\s>
<s> But walking new paths asks for alot of courage , which people can get when they get older and more experienced . <\s>
<s> So finaly I want to say everybody has the chance to be successful , they just have to be willing to take the risk . <\s>
<s> Every coin has two side A broadknowledge of many academic subjects , specializing in one specific subject , which is better option in the practice ? <\s>
<s> I have to categrized this issue into two part just as every coin has two side . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On one side , it 's better to have a broad knowledge of subjects in the condition that you are a undergraduate student . <\s>
<s> For the younger students -- undergraduate student , they are not ready for a specialized study . <\s>
<s> I am also a undergraduate student . <\s>
<s> I can recognize that current courses for a undergraduate student is more generalize and widespread . <\s>
<s> One is n't able to have a deep understanding of a certain subject beofore he/she learn the more subjects in his major and understand more common sense . <\s>
<s> It 's obviously that the common sense in a certain field can help get a job or help he/she prepare for the consititute On the other hand , suppose you 're a graduate student , a deep undertanding of several or single subject is necessary . <\s>
<s> The graduate will be a expert in a single fileds , which need more knowledge and experience of the narrow field rather than a wide understanding of several easiler common sense . <\s>
<s> In the information age nowadays , more and more positions in some field appear which require speciliazation as the society develops , which is such as in high technology companiesand bank . <\s>
<s> More experts are needed to fill any blank of such positioins . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum it up , we need to recgnize that the society has many different roles for each student . <\s>
<s> You ca n't define wich is wright or wrong if you don ; t know the specific condition a person is facing . <\s>
<s> In a word , both method of agree or disgree with the topic statement has i <\s>
<s> I believe that is more important for students to learn fact in a real way , rather than learn only knowledge . <\s>
<s> An example to support this idea is the comparison between university skills and work experiences . <\s>
<s> If a student learns about something practical it will be helped in the all day life and in the work life . <\s>
<s> On the contrary learning only concepts and ideas at the university is less useful in the real life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The experience that a person can achieve during a period of work , it 's something that you ca n't learn everywhere . <\s>
<s> Throughout the education , students ( for what concern the Italian system ) do n't achieve as many practical things as they can bring from a business environment . <\s>
<s> For example I had a work period during the summer vacations in a marketing office of an international company , here I applied all my knowledge in the area . <\s>
<s> In this company I learnt practical marketing techniques that my university professors have never thaught to me . <\s>
<s> Then , when I came back to the University and the marketing professor give us a task on how to develop the brand image of a business , I was ready and with many skills on this field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A thing that universities should do , it is to develop a better program of activities that students should be obliged to undertake . <\s>
<s> For instance providing working period in a business , whether the university department is business and management ; field trip at caves , lakes or mountain in the geology university and so on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the real life learning practical issues is a very important part of people lives . <\s>
<s> If a student practice his skills since he is in the early education , when he will enter the world of work he could be more prepared to struggle with the competion . <\s>
<s> Therefore he could have a good curriculum in comparison with people that don-t have experience . <\s>
<s> It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every single individual have a unique way . <\s>
<s> Some students understand more ideas and concepts but others understand better facts . <\s>
<s> The ideas are more comprehensive and understand than facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Teachers or professors are the person who helped the student to understand the topic . <\s>
<s> If teacher explains the topic very clearly and comprehensive with specific ideas the student will understand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The ideas are the important things of every topic . <\s>
<s> If you understand the ideas of every topic . <\s>
<s> The idea remain in your mind because you are going remember the important things of every class . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> You can describe idea as the main point of anything . <\s>
<s> The main point helped the student to understand what the teacher try to explain . <\s>
<s> If you do n't have a main point of what are talking about there is not idea . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The facts are more details but not specific as ideas . <\s>
<s> The facts are more details to understand . <\s>
<s> To able to understand main point you need to understand the facts but sometimes , you will understand the main point first and then fact . <\s>
<s> It 's all depend how do you study . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some students like to pay attention and try to find idea of the topic than the facts . <\s>
<s> Students like to listen the main idea instead facts . <\s>
<s> They want to find the idea right away . <\s>
<s> The idea can be very comprehensive and intellectual for the students who really likes to study and learn . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conlusion , It 's more easy for the student to understand the ideas than facts . <\s>
<s> It 's helped the student to develop a understanding of the class and focuses in main point rather in facts . <\s>
<s> The facts can confused the students . <\s>
<s> Some of the people prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , and some not . <\s>
<s> I think it is better to get broad knowledge from many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> If my country allow this way , I believe I used to select this method but unfortunately I could n't . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the adventages of this way is that it is not easy to forecat the ability of the students in the begining of the university . <\s>
<s> I think in my country most of the university students do not like their subjects . <\s>
<s> Because our university selecting system does not reflect the students abilities . <\s>
<s> All people who graduated from college should attend to an exam . <\s>
<s> After getting the score from this exam they should fill a form about the sections and universities and they should sequenced these choices from the highest score of preview year to lower . <\s>
<s> At the end they start one of them or try to get enough score in the following year . <\s>
<s> If these student get any chance to select more than one university or section I think it will increase the rate of pleasure of students about their sections . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The other reason for my choice about after graduation . <\s>
<s> During university years , students can not imagine their rest of lifes certainly . <\s>
<s> Because in my country the relations between university and industry is very weak . <\s>
<s> So students can not get information about their jobs during lessons . <\s>
<s> After graduate most of the students could n't make their dream works . <\s>
<s> This cause unsatisfied people and unhappy families . <\s>
<s> But If they could get any second subject they can select one of them after start to work and get real information about their bussiness life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am an engineer and I do not like make engineering . <\s>
<s> Fortunetly after start to job I promoted to management and I find out my dream work . <\s>
<s> I believe I created by God for management and I like very much to manage the people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally I can say that to create more happy publics ' goverments should change the rules and allow to people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> In my point of view , it is allways good to have knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> When you are based only in one specific subject you will never be ready to do any other project that comes up . <\s>
<s> You will only be ready for things you know . <\s>
<s> Many examples exist on the world of today , people only study what they want to do in life . <\s>
<s> So all they are based on is on that material , But what happens when their future doesnt turn to be what they had planed ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> College is the opportunity to choose what you really want to be in the future . <\s>
<s> You must know that what you study is what you are going to have to spend the rest of your life doing . <\s>
<s> Sometimes things dont go the way you plan . <\s>
<s> It is why we should have knowledge in all academics subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Beeing specialized in one subject has its advantege and disadvantege . <\s>
<s> beeing specialized on what you think you are going to be good at , its sometimes a risk . <\s>
<s> We are not sure of what is waiting for us out there . <\s>
<s> For example : if i choose to study law , and im good at it but everything i know is law . <\s>
<s> So in my future i dont get a good job , but company offers me a better job but not as a lawyer as a business man. i cant take it because im not good at it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advantege of beeing specialized in one subject is that if im really good at it i have 90 % of beeing the best a t it . <\s>
<s> That will bring you opportunities to have the best job and be well paid . <\s>
<s> For example when you study medicine . <\s>
<s> If you are only based on those subjects and graduate with honors . <\s>
<s> You know for sure you are going to be the best doctor because of you knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It it allways good to know many academic subjects but at the same time to be based on what you like to do . <\s>
<s> That way you are sure that no matter what happens with what you are based on , you will allways have different choices for the future . <\s>
<s> The topic in disguise deals with , a person being generalist or a specialist . <\s>
<s> A generalist is a perosn who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> A specialist is a person who has deep knowledge in one subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject . <\s>
<s> A person with broad knowledge in many subjects , a generalist , can deal with any kind of subject thought he cannot go deep into the subject he has good amount of knowledge about the subject . <\s>
<s> So he can deal with any of the subjects . <\s>
<s> Where as a person with deep knowledge about a single subject cannot deal with different subjects as he has no idea about other subjects . <\s>
<s> It is must to have knowledge of all the subjects to get through the exams and attain grades . <\s>
<s> Even in case of getting a job , a generalist has more chances of getting a job rather than a specialist as a generalist can deal any kind of subject that is given to him . <\s>
<s> Where as a specialist has to keep mum when asked about any other subject . <\s>
<s> The companies would definately require a multi-talented person rather than a person who has great talent in a single subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> `` As every coin has two sides '' . <\s>
<s> We cannot always say that having broad knowledge is vital . <\s>
<s> Hence there is a saying `` Jack of all trades but master in none '' . <\s>
<s> A multi talented person with no deep knowledge in any subject cannot acheive success all the time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Knowledge in depth is required when it comes to certain areas of science such as astronomy , medicine etc . <\s>
<s> In these areas a person cannot sustain with vauge knowledge . <\s>
<s> It is crucial for a person to have knowledge in depth . <\s>
<s> Else these proffesions would turn out to be disasters . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence what I would like to conclude is , a person must have minimum knowldge about all the academic subjects and must excel in one atleast to acheive success . <\s>
<s> Some people like to try new things and are n't afraid of taking risks . <\s>
<s> But taking risks and trying new things make people succesful ? <\s>
<s> In my opinion the key to success is to take risks and try new things which does n't exist . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , without taking risks people can only remain the place where they are . <\s>
<s> Only doing what they already know how to do well helps them to stay where they are and does n't give any opportunities to make a good career in their life . <\s>
<s> I claim that taking risks is a very dangerous way of being succesfull . <\s>
<s> Because there is nothing guraantied after taking the risk and trying new things . <\s>
<s> The ending could be very miserible . <\s>
<s> But considering the benefits and the awards of taking risks and trying new things , taking risks are preferable than doing always the same things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , taking risks can give very good vision to see the world in a different way and affects the culture of people in a good way . <\s>
<s> As a simple example , trying a new kind food is very hard thing to do for most of the people . <\s>
<s> People would prefer eating the same kind of food all the time . <\s>
<s> But one who tries the new kind food gains a knowledge about this kind and his culture about food increases . <\s>
<s> To think taking risks in business , for example , thinking about a factory which is producing the same kind of product since the first day , can only earn little amount of money because the product is old and could be produced by other factories and the demand is reduced to this product . <\s>
<s> But a new factory that tries a new product and takes risk by making an investment to produce the new product can be very profitable and earn better than the other factory . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , if people want to be successful in any area of the life should not be afraid of taking risks and try new things . <\s>
<s> This will bring the succeess to them . <\s>
<s> I personally agree with the statement that it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than just learning the facts because for a student getting to understand many facts is very important before applying it on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , let us take a student who in school stage appears for an exam . <\s>
<s> If he prepares a particular lesson in the syllabus by mere mugging or learning the facts in the textbook without getting to understand the concept and the idea of about what the lesson expresses , it would be very difficult for him to pen down on his examination because one cant rely basically only on the memory . <\s>
<s> What if the student gets tensed as soon as he sees the question of that particular portion . <\s>
<s> Being more anxious could result in palpitations and tends to forget what he memorised , may not put forth the answer . <\s>
<s> Instead if the student would have made just to understand about the idea and concept then it would be easy for him to put forth and develop in his own words too which may actually be an expressive thought and eventually fetch him more marks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Take an other example of a research student . <\s>
<s> A reasearch paper to be completed needs lots of informations which should be compiled properly to meet the requirements of the research study . <\s>
<s> For this to happen a students tries to gather many information and materials , take notes , read . <\s>
<s> establish in mind how to put in orders needs lots of ideas . <\s>
<s> Only if he could understand the basic concept of that particular subject or paper he can develop new ideas which will fetch him good notes to complete a research paper eventually winning praises for his work which shows confidence . <\s>
<s> This will be very useful for the student if he is asked to deliver a paper presentation , because he has already understood the concept and the basic idea which has given him the confidence to express and deliver in public gathering . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example could also be taken which was proved , that is the Newton 's Law of Gravity . <\s>
<s> Just because Newton had the capacity to understand his topic to be invented his thought process welcomed the idea and thus the Law of Gravity was exposed to the world . <\s>
<s> If he would have just learned the fact probably till now the law of gavity wouldnt have been in exixtence . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus I come to the conclusion that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn merely the facts only and I stand for my choice . <\s>
<s> In today 's world , we are overwhelmed by advertisements by differents means . <\s>
<s> The media play an important role to embellish the product and give them quality that they do n't have . <\s>
<s> To begun with , advertisement has a great impact on the population . <\s>
<s> People get to know new products and depending the source of the advertisment people think that the product is a good quality . <\s>
<s> One exampleis the the `` Oprah '' book club and she really does advertisement on this book club show . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Oprah is famous and her show is watched by millions of people . <\s>
<s> Any time she recommend a book , people rush to the bookstore to buy the book . <\s>
<s> In this way , she made some writters very famous while some critics think that most of the autors she recommend are not good writters . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , technology used in the advertisement present the product as having qualities than they do n't possess . <\s>
<s> How often , people rush to buy a product after seeing it on TV or ness papers and take it back the next day because the product did n't have the quality they expected on the advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , Advertisement has an incredible effect on the consummer . <\s>
<s> Because technology in this business can enhance the appearance of the product . <\s>
<s> And most of the time the product is reallly different from what it looks on the advertisement <\s>
<s> I think that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , if you understand the concept , you have always time to learn facts or dates . <\s>
<s> In children education , for example , it 's important to give them the instruments to understand nature and society . <\s>
<s> I think it 's not so important to fill them with dates and facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Morever , if a child understand a concept , he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life . <\s>
<s> If he learn a fact without understanding it , he will forget it in a month . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old , just because my teacher explained the meaning of them . <\s>
<s> I can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explenation of them . <\s>
<s> If a teacher tells a fact without explaining it for the children has no sense and they do n't put attention on it . <\s>
<s> The same is in adults education . <\s>
<s> In the university of medicine , for example , is much more important to understand how to visit a patient , than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body . <\s>
<s> You always have time to take a book and learn it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I have to mention that there are facts or notions that people need to know . <\s>
<s> For example a doctor , of course has to understand how the body works and how to visit a patient , but he also has to know the dosis of the medicaments or the name of the most important parts of the body . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An antropologist has to understand the human behavior but he also has to know about history and languages and cultures . <\s>
<s> So , even if ideas and concepts are more important in education , there are some facts and notions than students have to learn . <\s>
<s> The world is developing day by day . <\s>
<s> New thoughts , new technologies are being applied to make developements . <\s>
<s> I disagree to the point that there will be fewer cars than there are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , we can see that different banks are emerging today in this competetive market . <\s>
<s> These banks provide loans at a very affodable rate of interest such that any one can think of buying a car . <\s>
<s> Besides this , the car sellers are comming up with different types of intresting and profit making schemes such that everyone prefer to buy a car . <\s>
<s> Schemes like providing insurance free of cost , free equipments along with the car and many more things which attracts people to buy the car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondy , as i said earliar that competetion are increasing daily , so car manufacturs are making cars having so many facilities that people are tempted to buy it . <\s>
<s> Facilities like a small refrigerator , racks for keeping books , mobile charger , music system and many things . <\s>
<s> We can take a example of a very busy person . <\s>
<s> If he gets so much facilities in his own car then he dont have to wait or go any where for water or dont have spend any time in charging his mobile as all these things can be done while he going somewhere . <\s>
<s> At the same time they manufacture cars that requires very less maintainence . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , now a days people are giving much attention to the health as pollution made by factories and other things are increasing day-by-day . <\s>
<s> So instead of buying a two wheeler they prefer to buy a car which is more safer and at the same time they can be free from pollution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So as the world is moving forward so fast people also want to cope up with everyone , regarding status , health , wealth and everything . <\s>
<s> So i think that the number of cars are surely going to increase twenty years from today . <\s>
<s> First and foremost we can notice that a lot of successful people have got this autority by taking risks . <\s>
<s> Indeed nowadays , to became famous is a proof of imagination and above all a mark of creativity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the one hand , whatever the skills of these people , we have to consider the fact that once the got successful , they have more tools , money and experience than the other can have . <\s>
<s> For instance we can infer that they can use a lot of money they won by the risks they took before . <\s>
<s> Thus it appears easier for them to carry on acting in this way of risk because the weight of it would be not as hard to support in case of failure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand it goes without saying that this people are aware on the success price . <\s>
<s> Concerning my opinion it is obvious that in business for example , trying to work all the time in a way of innovation is likely to get this business better than is other classic one . <\s>
<s> The first who will discover and convey a new concept or a new way of thinking will seduce first the consumer . <\s>
<s> It is hardly surprising that the successfull people try to be creating and innovating as possible . <\s>
<s> Moreover everybody needs to use his own skills but they will probably not enough in the case where everybody get them . <\s>
<s> We can infer that the successful people used the other skills the got by beca ; e successful <\s>
<s> In these days , lots of companies want from their employees to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> However , in my opinion , to specialize in one specific subject is better for peoples for some reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , to specialize in one specific subject is good for a person . <\s>
<s> If a person only interested in one specific subject , he or she can focus in that subject carefully and he or she can know all of the details of that subject . <\s>
<s> He or she whoever study a specific subject will be an expert of his or her subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second of all , If an employee in a big company have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects , the manager of that company can do out of work others employees because of the person who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> That is unemployment and it is not good for economy and employees . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So everybody can do their job in the big companies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third of all , If a person wants to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it would be killing-time because that person can start their career in a company and he or she can start living real life a few years ago . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , although lots of companies want from their workers to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects nowadays . <\s>
<s> Because of these reasons such as focusing in one subject , employment , start to live real life a few years ago it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> `` It is the idea that creats one 's interest in learning things conceptually and this eventually leads him know the facts related to the idea '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As far as my opinion is concerned i agree with the statement `` It is important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn the facts '' because unless i get an idea i will not know how to start with . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Once i get an idea i will try learning , learning needs the conceptual base for the skilled building . <\s>
<s> As soon as i start learning and i acquire concept i will try getiing back to the history of that particular idea will will get me across the facts related to it . <\s>
<s> On the contrary if i learn facts this will not helps me to be more creative . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , as a doctor if i have an idea of recearch in neuron and glial cells in brain i will first study the whole stuff related to the neurons , the glial cells and the things related to these two things . <\s>
<s> After understanding the concept of the research and having a clear idea i can get along with the research . <\s>
<s> During the research i will come across the facts regarding the neurons and the glial cells . <\s>
<s> On the other hand if i start with the facts my knowledge will be limited to an extent and i will not try learning more about it as i will be convinced by the the tag it has got that is `` FACT '' . <\s>
<s> Once i know it is fact i will not try learning about it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus i feel it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> This will make them more innovative and provides them with a wide scope of learning the subject . <\s>
<s> when one understands the idea and concept definetly he will come across the facts related to the subject . <\s>
<s> To conclude `` Ideas and concepts include facts , but not the vice versa '' <\s>
<s> I personally agree with this statement and hope to justify my opinion by the following reasons and examples . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the ideas and concepts are the origin of the facts . <\s>
<s> for example , if some one understand idea or concept then he can make a research and experiement . <\s>
<s> If this proved that this idea applies the real data then he can argued that it 's a fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> secondly , when we talk about fact , in effect we talk about constant thing . <\s>
<s> in other word , no one has the encouragement to search in this fact `` the door is closed '' . but if he has an idea he has the freedom to extent it into another field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , the person who interested with ideas and concepts has the ability of thinking more than the person who just keep some idea in his memory because the first one dos n't know what is the end and he will contenuously try to find this idea . <\s>
<s> for example , when a profesor talk about nonotechnology , he always mentions the idea micro-robot and the scholars who interested in this idea endeavor to use this idea to treat the cancer by some way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally , specialization or majority of a student in some field or science need to ideas , because if he want to write his thesis or project in this field must do some new but who can gain acadimic degree by discovering some fact , if this method of graduation will have a few profesor . <\s>
<s> butif you like to have this acadimic status you must interest in ideas because they are the key of future and way to inventions . <\s>
<s> the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is very very fun . <\s>
<s> first you just start from the bigginig before you tarvel , going shoping with a big group of friends . <\s>
<s> you buy a bunch of stuff for your trip , and at the same time your just having fun with your friends . <\s>
<s> in just buying stuff , then while your at the airplane you talk , take pictures from the plane with your friends too ! <\s>
<s> then when you get to the place , lets say paris , you wanted to go there because you and your friends decides to go and because your going to have a lot of fun . <\s>
<s> then when you are there you start with you tour guide that is very borring , obviously you have to learn a little about the country your visiting ok , ill handle that but not every day , and then go visit all kinds of museums . <\s>
<s> after all that crowded day at night we go ut with my friends in group , that the big deal here going to have fun with all your friends togeather , because your with people that know waht you like or do not like , and because its a very special trip for you in a big happy group . <\s>
<s> about a tour guide wasnt that fun because he like your boss well not like your boss seriously he just tells you what we have to do all day and what we need to visit . <\s>
<s> i could do that all that stuff but in a calm day with my friends . <\s>
<s> but i can handle all what the tour guides tells us to do while im with all my friends having fun , and its just because im with my friends , to see how fun it is to be with a very big group you know well and can have a great time . <\s>
<s> It seems strange but also before this text i was speaking about this problem with some of my friends . <\s>
<s> In particular we discussed about the case of Milan a very famous city , that is located near were I live . <\s>
<s> This city has a lot of problems and one of them is the traffic caused by cars . <\s>
<s> Immaging that this city has normally one million of inhabitans , but everyday more then one million and half people , arrive at the city for their job , and most of them driving their cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During the last century a lot off chages happened , if we consider that car or better the motor was discovered at the end of the 19th century . <\s>
<s> The reason of this problem could be found at the middle of the 20th century were the possibility to have a car were a status symbol . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I can not affirm if in twenty years there will be fewer cars then there are today , but i am sure that it is neccessary to do something to change this situation , not only for the quantity of traffic but for the consequences that this pollusion has on our environment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The very big problem especially in Italy , is caused by the terrible conditions of our national system of transportation , i am speaking about old and often dirthy trains , pullmans .. <\s>
<s> that do not cover the real necessity of the people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that this is the right way that the institutions and the governaments as to follow , because without investiments nothing could be change . <\s>
<s> We should study alternative system of trasport incresing the use of modern and faster machine as the magnetic train already in use in Germany and China , or we just have to give a look to the past as some countryes done , reintroducing the use of pratic and .. <\s>
<s> bycycle <\s>
<s> It is better to start with describing the successful people ; they have an unlimited brain , they do not think like normal peoples and they are capable to get used to new conditions . <\s>
<s> After this description it is not possible to disagree the ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing twhat they alredy know how to do well ' idea . <\s>
<s> `Taking risks makes money ' and ` More risk = more money ' is accepted ideas in economy and this idea forces successful people to go on doing something new . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Success is a sick , like using some illegal drugs , when you start overcoming some problems ( we call it success ) you need more to make yourself more successed . <\s>
<s> We can say it is not only making some money , it is trying to make ( earn ) <\s>
<s> ALL money in the world . <\s>
<s> That is why succeed people trying to give self-cofidence to their children than teaching some specific formulas . <\s>
<s> Successful people has an interesting risk management ability , at the same time this ability have made them successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some unsuccessful people might be succeed , just one or two success are enough for them they can stop going ahead after creation is completed . <\s>
<s> We can call their success as luck . <\s>
<s> They know that it was their luck and they do not want to risk to loose everything they earned actually they can not do it . <\s>
<s> But really successful people , like in the statement , use their previous experience on next job and they know that they can do the next better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I absulately agree that successful people can not be limited or stopped with just several successes . <\s>
<s> Also they agree that ` doing what they already know how to do well ' will kill their successful minds . <\s>
<s> Making more succes needs taking more risk idea is in their blood and these kind of people is not programmed to stop after a while . <\s>
<s> Currently travel in a group led by a tour guide becomes one of successeful businesses over all the world . <\s>
<s> But is it really best way to journey ? <\s>
<s> I do not agree this point from my perspective . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think travel is very personal thing to process , such as planning and preparation . <\s>
<s> These parts are also funny things plus to `` real '' travel . <\s>
<s> You can not have your own flexit time plan after you joint in a gourp , and even it does not need you to plan it . <\s>
<s> For instance , if you would like to spend more days on the beach but the travel group you jointed into has already planned to visit another town . <\s>
<s> How frustrate it is ! <\s>
<s> If you travel alonely , you can always change your mind and plan about the journey . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition to , from my experiences in alone journey , I would have more opportunity to meet local people and have conversation with them . <\s>
<s> It is beneficial to understand deeper and more abour the local culture and local civilization . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , if you are in a travel group , you must spend most of your time conversation with your group members and miss the chance to communication even making friends with local residents . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Perhaps someone would indicates that travel with a group is convenient , but I would argue that travel alone is advantage by enjoying the feature of convenient . <\s>
<s> Since you only need to consider you suitation not all the people in the group . <\s>
<s> For example , I like to choose five start hotel to rest , because it will supply good and convenient condition for my vacation . <\s>
<s> But if I am in a travel group , the tour guide must need listen to other people 's suggestion . <\s>
<s> They may think it is so expensive that they unwilling to live in a five start hotel , or they more willing to spend money on buying things from local . <\s>
<s> That will waste time to decide where we live . <\s>
<s> But if I am alone , I do not need to consider so many things . <\s>
<s> It means convenient for me . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , I would argue that advantage of the travel alone outweighs the travel in a group . <\s>
<s> Since you will have your plan and preparation , chance to meet local people and convenient in the travel . <\s>
<s> Famous French Army General and president CHARLES DE GAULE once said : '' the best ways of studying how to command is to study a broad of knowledge of many academic subjects '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Why did he say that ? <\s>
<s> And is this only good to learn how to command , or is this true for everything ? <\s>
<s> That is the question to answer . <\s>
<s> I would say it depends on what one 's expect it 's knowlege is needed for . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On one hand , If it is for everyday living , i suppose this is very right : for exemple , during the day , we all meet many people who with we talk about very different subject ( economics , social issues , work , family or simply last night TV program ) . <\s>
<s> In this case , the more on different subject we know , the more people will appreciate to talk with us . <\s>
<s> If someone wants to know your own point of view on an specific event , and if you answer him '' i do n't know and i ' not interested in that '' , we can guess he will not ask you anymore ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ther is anothere exemple : most politics program are based on economic or social problems to solve . <\s>
<s> if you do n't have any idear about it , how will you understand the debate , the different opinions ? <\s>
<s> And how then , will you make your choice for the next vote ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , i beleive , we all still have a child slleeping in our brean : so like children , we like discovering new things , being curious , this is another good reason to study many acade ; ic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , i beleive it is difficult for a teacher or a scientist not to specialize in one subject . <\s>
<s> same thing for peolple who have very specialized jobs such as engineers or finance administrators ... <\s>
<s> How would these people be experts if they had not specialize in their owm specific subject . <\s>
<s> how would a teacher answer to all the questions student ask him every lessons ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As it seens impossible to specialize in all the subjects , i suppose these teachers , scientists or expert have no choice . <\s>
<s> however , i beleive , they still also studied other subject , even if it is not with the same accuracy . <\s>
<s> Also , i think they are interested in many other subjects and they can talk about other things than their owm specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think there is no better way of studying , it depends on what you will have to do later in your jobs . <\s>
<s> but me , i definitely followed Charles DE GAULLE advice ... <\s>
<s> In fact , people usually think that life is more enjoyable when a person is a teenager . <\s>
<s> I actually dont agree with this idea . <\s>
<s> I think it depends on the personality rather than the age . <\s>
<s> In this passage I will try to explain my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First let us have a look at the periods of life . <\s>
<s> A child usually seems happy with his or her toys . <\s>
<s> And a young boy may enjoy the time that he spend with his girl friend . <\s>
<s> A young lady may find her hobbies or interests after her work time . <\s>
<s> An old lady may be very happy when she is with her grandchildren . <\s>
<s> These are really a sight through the window of an optimistic person , are not they ? <\s>
<s> Thus , it can easily be seen that a person can enjoy the life at any age . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although these examples can be expansed , we can sometimes ran into pessimistic people . <\s>
<s> When an optimistic person can be happy with his bicycle , small but pretty house etc. an optimistic can look for the ways in order to be worried . <\s>
<s> This kind of somber person usually copmplains about unnecessary things like not having much money , not being a famous person , etc . <\s>
<s> I think , this kind of pessimist people cant be simply happy even if they are 17 years old . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From this it can be concluded that I dont agree the statement and believe that a person at any age can enjoy the life . <\s>
<s> I have talked about the periods of life and gave examples of both optimist people who enjoy the life and pessimists who makes life harder unnecessarily . <\s>
<s> According to me , every person may not enjoy life as much as others , however , it shouldnt be forgotten that every age gives the same chance to enjoy . <\s>
<s> If you ask people , who have success in their work , to change the work and do something else or go to another country , they will not be afraid of doing this . <\s>
<s> Because they have success and want to be more successful . <\s>
<s> So I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People who have success want to be more successful by doing more things and especially different things in order to show that they are successful in every branche . <\s>
<s> They may have a complex or so but they think they have to show everybody that they are successful in their work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people would change the country to be more successful in their life . <\s>
<s> For example the person is very successful in Europe and now wants to be also successful in America . <\s>
<s> Step by step this person will work and do everything to be more successful and to show the word that he / she is a grand person . <\s>
<s> So that the person can be proid of herself / himself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In some cases families will be destroyed because the parents want to be successful . <\s>
<s> Having nothing in the mind only to be successful in life , parents could forget their children . <\s>
<s> They do not forget their children but they do not see the importance of their children and that they need love and other things like that . <\s>
<s> With leaving the family a person risks a very big importance in the life because to have a family is one of the biggest and best things you ever would get . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And why should a successful person do something that he or she already know how to do it ? <\s>
<s> In my opinion this would not be interesting for a successful person because these people want to be more and more successful in there work and every part in there life . <\s>
<s> So they have to discover ther things that are for they unknown to show uo other pe <\s>
<s> There are some people who voice serious doubts about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and who are prepared to argue with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but i would have to say that if i faced with the decision , my choice will be for having broad knowledge of many academic subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First reason why i support having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is knowing many things with this way . <\s>
<s> If we know somethings about many academic subjects , we can effect people while we are searching job . <\s>
<s> For instance , there is a man who graduated from university and who is searching job for the money but he only specialize in one specific subject before the his business life . <\s>
<s> I think he can not be sucessful in his career because of this . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , there is a man who know something about many subjects . <\s>
<s> This man easily can effect the people who are manage the company so he can easily find the job for working and he can earn good money in his business life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason why i support having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that i think the knowing many things is symbol of the evolotion . <\s>
<s> If the country have people who know something about many subjects , this country can easily develop in all ways so knowing many things is also useful for our country . <\s>
<s> One the other hand , counry which have people who specialize in one one subject can not develop easily . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all from what has been mentioned above , we can safely draw the conclusion that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better tahn they really are . <\s>
<s> In the recent years people 's lifes have been greately improved , and pepole began to demend more things to their lifes . <\s>
<s> Becasues there are more demends , or consumers , the market started to expend , and it caused more suppliers joined into the market . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Suppliers must compete with each other inorder to let consumers to buy their products , and one effcient way to compete with others is advertising . <\s>
<s> Before buying anything from the suppliers , consumers would try to know more about the products through advertisements made by the suppliers , and this gives the suppliers a chance to show their products . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Bearly no one would buy a thing just by one look , so the advertisements need to be more detailed and more attractive . <\s>
<s> Consumers would compare about the advertisements between different suppliers rather than the products themselves . <\s>
<s> Suppliers clearly understand what consumers 's thoughts are , and they would try to add more things to the advertisements , what may make them more superior than the others . <\s>
<s> The superior ones are always more attractive to the consumers , at least more people would pay more attentions to them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although the `` addtional '' things or functions added to the advertisement are usually not exist or in the real products or the real ones will not work as efficient as the one the in advertisement , but it would never be a problems for the supplier , because what they cared most is the amount of product been sold . <\s>
<s> Consumers may not recoganize what is true about the products until they bought them , and somehow they have to accpt the truth although they expected a much better result . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the recent years advertisements are no longer a way for consumers to get knowing about the productions from the suppliers , but more likely they became a way to just increase the selling amount by the sellers . <\s>
<s> Things described better than the real ones in the advertisement are very common now , it is a misfortune for most of the consumers . <\s>
<s> I would like to point out that I disagree with this statement . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact you have to learn in school or at the university the basics in each course . <\s>
<s> It would be unproductive to start at the end of a special topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As an illustration I would like to mention that I study medicine in hannover . <\s>
<s> I am in the fifth year of my studies and accomplished about 250 oral and practical tests in a lot of courses . <\s>
<s> In my opinion I could say that I have a special knowledge in a lot of medical fields . <\s>
<s> As everybody knows is medicine a fluent topic and there is a lot of research going on . <\s>
<s> You have to read a lot of abstracts and surely you learn to build your own different view of the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Regarding the statement I tend to talk about my doctor thesis , which I began two weaks ago . <\s>
<s> Above all it describes certain areas of the Brain and their functions . <\s>
<s> I have to read a lot of books about this topic and later on I will prepare any virtual experiments with mouses . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Actually I can relate on my fundamental knowledge of five years of study . <\s>
<s> There are some new ideas and also theories concerning my researches so I have to spend a lot of time dealing with those . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to my dissertation I could not imagine doing it without any medical skills . <\s>
<s> First of all you start with a and then you end with the z. It is not conversely . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furtherore , I think that ideas reveal under specific circumstances . <\s>
<s> Only when you consider these circumstances you can probably understand the main point of this idea . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion I would like to say the better your general knowledge about a topic is , the more you can talk . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with that statement . <\s>
<s> Advertisements are made to attract potential consumer of a product whatever it is . <\s>
<s> And it is effective far more when people are impressed by the presentation of the product than when they are rationally convinced of its utility . <\s>
<s> In addition advertisement are seen on TV mostly when people get back from work so that their are two tired to be critical about the advertisement or to be convinced rationally . <\s>
<s> So a car on a TV spot which look like a super protective and high tech engine actually much more than it is would not make the consumer sceptical about its performance . <\s>
<s> The consumer is exhausted so he will be happy to see some ideal presentation of a product . <\s>
<s> In fact people would often prefer fake advertisement than realistic one . <\s>
<s> A too down to earth tv spot would not catch attention because people often watch TV to escape from the difficulties of their life . <\s>
<s> It is more suitable for advertisers to present the ideal objects to consumer in order to be in their state of mind when they watch the spot . <\s>
<s> In most advertisements car are the better , food the more tasty etc ... <\s>
<s> And after in the supermarket we know not the product but his adverti <\s>
<s> In my opinion it is definitely preferable to have a broad knowledge of several academic subjects to specializing in one single area . <\s>
<s> The most important aspect to me is the variaton in topics which one specific subject can not supply . <\s>
<s> If - regarding the academics - I had only one topic with which I would have to spend my entire working time I would eventually get fed up with the subject , as variation is the key to keeping me interested . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Specialization limits your point of view whereas a broad knowledge of different subjects enables you to understand different people with different academic backgrounds . <\s>
<s> Furthermore specializing in only one topic makes it less probable to meet new people with different backgrounds at all as you will not leave your main field of interest very frequently . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Broadening your skills also might have some positive effects on your social environment . <\s>
<s> You might find more friends and have more success with the other sex as you will appear more interesting not being a ` freak ' who is only interested in one single thing but being able to look like a person with different facettes and diverse interests . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In discussions with collegues , friends or other person at you will certainly have a less harder time being educated in more than one topic as you might easily find arguments and examples in your various subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To summarize all the mentioned points make it by far more attractive for me to gain knowledge in not only one subject but many different , although one should try no to have too many interests , as superficial knowledge in many fields of mind also will not bring you very far . <\s>
<s> According to the question I think that is most important for the students to understand ideas and concepts because when you undestand something you can apply it much better on the life . <\s>
<s> If you get the main idea of something you can convine it with your imagination and experience and that makes something powerfull because yo can create . <\s>
<s> For example , if you are studying some Engineering you need to find the shorttest way to solve a problem . <\s>
<s> Sometimes you just can find the solution of your problem looking in a book but not always is like that and there is when you have to apply yor knowelege . <\s>
<s> You have to apply the concepts that you already learnt and with that you have to find the answer . <\s>
<s> That example can be applied to the all majors because when you want to be the best in whatever that you do , you must to apply concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> In the other hand , when you just learn facts you just get information that could be important or not . <\s>
<s> Is good to know facts because you can explain better something but when you know a fact you should be worried about the idea or the concept that make possible that fact . <\s>
<s> For example , one man who just memorize information can not think well because he have a lot of information but can not apply it . <\s>
<s> His brain is to saturated with junk information that may be never use and that do not let think him . <\s>
<s> If you need to solve problems you can not keep just whit the information you must try to understand the things and that will help you more in your life that just know facts . <\s>
<s> I think broad knowledge of many subjects is good , but not always . <\s>
<s> So , I strongly disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think , in mordern world one should be specific towards the subject , because there is a limitation for human beings . <\s>
<s> A person ca n't be perfect in everything . <\s>
<s> For example there is a difference between the knowledge of an engineer and a doctor . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An engineer can better think about mechanical things like machines , instruments etc , where as a doctor can have better idea of presentation of human body than an engineer has . <\s>
<s> So , a doctor can better manipulate human body . <\s>
<s> So the knowledge is always limited for both of them . <\s>
<s> That is why , a person ca n't be a doctor or engineer at a time and ca n't be expert in both the fields . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Among doctors , a general practictioner has knowledge of human body but are not specialized in purticular area like cardiology , neurology etc . <\s>
<s> As they have limited knowledge , they refer the patients with cardiac problem to the cardiologist , who always has better knowledge of heart activities than them . <\s>
<s> So , a specialist in specific subject is always better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> . <\s>
<s> At last I will say that , due to limitations it is always better for a person to be specialized in a specific subject , because this is the way one can be perfect in the subject , and one can learn deeply about that subject that having little knowledge of many subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is the way one can stand in this competetive world with the perfect knowledge in the particular subject , otherwise the person will neither have good knowledge of all the subjects nor will be the master in one . <\s>
<s> This is the way I want to be in future , and would expect the same from others . <\s>
<s> I do agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than they are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> World is moving rapidly towords technalogy . <\s>
<s> People now are getting tierd of cars . <\s>
<s> because first they are very expensive to buy . <\s>
<s> Second , a person spends alot of money for petrol . <\s>
<s> roods are very busy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> cars brings alot of damege for exaple acidents that kills people . <\s>
<s> the smoke that comes out of the car brings alot of damge to your health . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Technalogy moves really fast . <\s>
<s> From now untill twenty years alot of thimgs are going to be invented like insted of driving in the rood people can fly with their own plans . <\s>
<s> Alot of other ways of transportation are going to be used . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People now use trains or the under ground trains . <\s>
<s> Alot of countries now use trains or motorcycle insted of cars do to the grown of their poupolation . <\s>
<s> I think people can manige to live without cars . <\s>
<s> One hundred years ago people used to transport by animals such as horses or camils . <\s>
<s> Do to techanolgy I think that people will invent something that doesnt do harm for people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A person wont think that after twenty years any thing will change , because its only twenty years , but the fact is that twenty years are alot for a person to invent something . <\s>
<s> How long did it take for a man to invet a space chip ? <\s>
<s> not more than twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My point is that alot of people no what is good for them and what is bad , even if they didnt notice it emidutly . <\s>
<s> with no time there will be something insted of cars that people can use to transport with it in much easier way , <\s>
<s> Are young people nowadays not giving enough time to helping their communities ? <\s>
<s> I disagree with this statement because i think many young people give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , while you attend a school , the school requires a certain amount of time of helping your communities . <\s>
<s> Moreover , almost every university requires those time when you apply for the university , so you have to help your communities if you want to enter the university whether you wish to help your community or not . <\s>
<s> Some of the young people may think that they are forced to do this , but it does n't change the fact that young people are doing the community activities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , there are many clubs which are organized to serve for the communities in universities . <\s>
<s> These clubs are made with the students ' freewill , not against their will . <\s>
<s> For example , I am an university student and currently I am a member of a club mainly help the orphans and serve in orphanages . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , older peple usually have more family members to feed than young people , so young people have more finical , mental , physical energy and time to help the communities . <\s>
<s> My father , for example , used to go to a volunteers ' club to serve in a certain place that needs people 's help like a place for the disabled before he got married , but after he got married and gave a birth to me , he does n't have enough time and energy as much as he used to have , so the frequency of his visits to a club has decreased and he does n't go there any more now , even though he wants to help . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , young people are more open-minded so they are willing to help the others than old people . <\s>
<s> Because the fact that you are young means that you have a flexible mind so that you can understand the circumstances that others are facing very well . <\s>
<s> This will make you easier to help your community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For those reasons , I think that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities unlike the statement . <\s>
<s> I Personally feel that this kind of situation will never occur in next twenty years . <\s>
<s> Because of the rapid development in technology and in the machinery goods and gadgets , which are expecting more materialiastic gains from such kind of development . <\s>
<s> In our day to day life every thing is becoming so easy and fast . <\s>
<s> Comparing with the older generations , cars are rapidly changing in their mechanisms as well in their outer apperance . <\s>
<s> due to which there is a great change in human life . <\s>
<s> For example , previously cars were used only for transport so that they can easily reach their destinations . <\s>
<s> but slowly they started adding luxurious comforts to this system by adding various elements such as A/C , music system , lavish seats .. <\s>
<s> it goes on ... <\s>
<s> And due to the rapid development in the countries with the competetion there are adding more and more comforts to the simple ones . <\s>
<s> Now a days due to the availaibilty of cars in economic price every one are having access to buy a car . <\s>
<s> So there will be healthier comptetion between the cars marketting companies , as they try in different ways to attract the customer by giving additional facilities which is lacking in other cars . <\s>
<s> Due to this kind of competition there is a launch of many cars per year with different names and different models , which is proved in a research . <\s>
<s> Few companies started manufacturing the car to get the publicity and to show their intresting innovations which will attract the customers and can simply remember the brand name ex : { ferrari } In other cases the cars which are very costlier and can never be affordable to the common man are increasing day by day . <\s>
<s> And buying these kind of cars give more importance to their social status . <\s>
<s> So people work hardly and vigorously to buy these kind of cars and can have a prestigious symbol or a tag with them . <\s>
<s> Wenever these people go out for a drive it grabs the attention of the others which makes the car owner feel happy and makes vivacious . <\s>
<s> i personally feel due to this kind of tremendous effort by the engineers they will improve a lot in the mechanism which makes the customer very easy to drive as well to enjoy the comfort and luxury provided by them and there will be more number of cars in the next generation . <\s>
<s> I agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> First , it is very dangerous if one travels alone . <\s>
<s> When we travel a new place , we do not know a lot about it . <\s>
<s> We will have plenty of problems . <\s>
<s> For example , we may get lost in the new place ; we may not found a right place to have meals and sleep after the whole tiring day . <\s>
<s> The first day of our travel will be full of finding , boring and tired . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , because if travel ina group , we could make a lot of new friends . <\s>
<s> I like to stay with other people . <\s>
<s> It will not make me feel frightened and alone . <\s>
<s> When one of us in trouble during the travel , the others will help him , we stay together like a big family . <\s>
<s> Sometimes after an interesting travel , someone could found his true love . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , our travel will become more interesting if we travel in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> The tour guide knows a lot of storise about the place which we are travelling . <\s>
<s> He will tell us the history about the great of interest when we see it . <\s>
<s> On the last National Day , I have a short tourist in HangZhou , I traveled alone without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I held the map and tried to find all the famous points that had marked on it . <\s>
<s> But I failed , I almost could not find any of them . <\s>
<s> I have got lost on the street at last . <\s>
<s> Fortunately , the police is very friendly , he help me to return my hotel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think the best wu <\s>
<s> I dont agree with `` Jack of all traits and master of none '' I personally feel its better to expertise in a single feild rather than trying to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects since , it will lead us no where . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , It would be a difficult task for the students to throw light on every subject they learn as a part of their academic curriculum . <\s>
<s> Instead of this , students can concentarte on a single subject and try to learn more of it . <\s>
<s> This will help the student to learn a subject with more interest and also gives a chance for the student to choose the subject they wish to expertise . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But in the case if the student tries to have a broad knowledge of all subjects one day he will be confused about himself . <\s>
<s> Therefore , its more advisable to master in a particular area of the students interest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To have a clear illustration of this let us consider a real time example . <\s>
<s> If we consider two students , among which one has a broad knowledge in all the academics and the other is a specialist in hardware engineering . <\s>
<s> If these two apply for a particular job say , for the post of a hardware engineer than the former student will have a few chances for accquiring the job since he has no profound knowledge in that particular area but , he just has an overview of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And therefore the other student will be consider for the job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not only in the case of employement but also in real life , the one who has deep knowledge of his specific subject could survive any where in this competitive market . <\s>
<s> And by expertising more in a single feild he will get a very good insight about his subject and he will be capable of fetching good rewards and fame in his area of study . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore it is always advisable to master in a particular feild . <\s>
<s> In my point of view , people should try for new things rather than doing the old things repetedly . <\s>
<s> Because sucess full things leads to do many new thing that are use full for man kind . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Peole who are in research field they use to invent new things that are use full for man kind , for example in the fields of medical and space research . <\s>
<s> In the medical fields there are so many diseases to be known and they should be cured . <\s>
<s> For example cancer & aids etc , researchers are doing continious invenctions how to find the new medicans that can cure 100 percent a man . <\s>
<s> So there should be some new thing to do reaserch that it can be cured in some other way . <\s>
<s> Comming to the electrical and mechanical things without taking risks , how people can invent the bulb and rotatory eqipements . <\s>
<s> so there should be some new things which thing leads to change in history . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But , a part from inventing new things there should be some updations what thay have earlier invented . <\s>
<s> For example computers was first invented by abuscus and the mechine was also prety large and heavy . <\s>
<s> But comming to the present computers have designed in a fashion that a man can carry from place to place without any need of help or with out any assistance . <\s>
<s> So there should be also a continous up gariation when some thing is inventd to make its ussage simple day by day . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , from the above points of explantion it can be said that people should invent to new things as well as old things . <\s>
<s> There shold be some manner of processure to do the things in a sucessfull manner . <\s>
<s> The things that are invented should support the environment it shold not distrub the man kind . <\s>
<s> And there shold be and regulary updation of the things that heve been invented and should be cheked wether it is in a proper condition or not <\s>
<s> The prase quoted `` YOUNG PEOPLE NOWADAYS DO NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO HELPING THEIR COMMUNITIES '' is a factor that lots of adults think may be true . <\s>
<s> But , I totally disagree to this . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Youth of today is very enthusiastic of their given responsibility , there job & their concerns regarding the work that they need to put forth . <\s>
<s> In this fast paced life of today , with severe competition that comes along from every corner of there life , this makes it imposible for the youth to dedicate much time toward there community or to say any social cause they wanna do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> They are so engulfed into the work , they already have very less time to just be by themself . <\s>
<s> Well one may consider that these are the reasons for a youth to not do the helpage required . <\s>
<s> But , I would like to say that inspite of the hardlife they have developed these youth never forget where they are & what they stand for . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many youth take time out of there busy schedule to dedicate time for the community they live in . <\s>
<s> These youth have actualy even started making there voices be heard . <\s>
<s> For example , the recent Medical Quota that the government had proposed for the beneficiery of the so called lower class of the community at the expense of merit was greatly put forward by the Medical student . <\s>
<s> Not because they did not want the upliftment of the community , that was socially biased by are ansestors , but for the the fact that they just wanted these seats to be given to the more deserving student who may be in a very economically challenged & brilliant student . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Todays youth are more about general development than a development in a particullar area . <\s>
<s> They just love experimenting in life . <\s>
<s> The youth of today has gone ahead of voice their opinion , to stand for themself in the purest of all the heart that is need . <\s>
<s> Inspite of the on going corruption thats eating our nation from every corner they stant to eradicate them for the better future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There lives in the fast-lane showns that they want to be quick in the decision making to solving problems . <\s>
<s> Todays youth is about Practical approach towards life that theoritical approach . <\s>
<s> So , according to me today the youth is there & they are giving enough time to the community for a better future . <\s>
<s> They will always be there . <\s>
<s> To justify whether young people do give enough time to helping their communities or not it is important to work out the situation a young woman or man is faced with in our society . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is a significant sign for young people that they seek for independence and try to go their own way . <\s>
<s> So they do not like to be resposible for somebody and also do not want to be addicted from the society . <\s>
<s> That could be a reason why the refuse to invest more time into their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But the major point why young people do this is another one . <\s>
<s> It reveals to the value and the image that is created especially in our job life . <\s>
<s> `` You have to be succesful , otherwise you get kicked. '' is a quote many young people are often The ellbow mentality provokes that young people often totally focus on their own career or even do not have the time to deal with the communitie 's tasks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is a rough and cold wind that blows in our society and retreating is the younger generation 's way to cope on this developement . <\s>
<s> Being social and caring for somebody else is definetly out at the moment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But this development is quite dangerous for us all and that is why it cannot be tolerated any more , otherwise we are just waiting for a bomb to explode . <\s>
<s> We have to come back to our values and identification as a community . <\s>
<s> It is important to communicate the greatness of being part of a community , to have friends and not being alone in difficult situations . <\s>
<s> The gap between rich and poor members is increasing tremendously fast and will even support sepperation from each other . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I think it is especially the task of the younger generation to see this problem and to deal with it . <\s>
<s> Otherwise the globalisation will hurt our society even harder and the problems might cannont be solved anymore . <\s>
<s> We have the responsibility and the ability to stop this development by trying to do our best and helping the people around . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Young people enjoy life more than older people . <\s>
<s> There are several reasons for me to support the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , because they are young , they will have lot of energy and curiosity to try several things in the world . <\s>
<s> Most of the young people have very few responsibilites towards their families . <\s>
<s> When parents provide all the amenities what all they wanted , they have nothing to worry , so they can enjoy alot . <\s>
<s> Most of the time young people will be healthy which give them enthusiasm to enjoy thier lives . <\s>
<s> But still not all the young people enjoy lot , some people will have lot of familily burden if his or her parents passed away or cannot looking them properly . <\s>
<s> So they will earn their bred and butter their own . <\s>
<s> They even provide financial support to the family . <\s>
<s> That kind of young people are more matured , so they enjoy and feel happy helping their families . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people cannot enjoy as much as young people do , the first reason is , they have more responsibilites towards familily . <\s>
<s> They have to look after their children , they have to provide good education to them and they need to earn sufficiently for the survival of the family . <\s>
<s> Moreover once they become little older they will concentrate more on the responsibilies , status and their reputation in the society . <\s>
<s> So they will have very less interest towards the enjoyment . <\s>
<s> In fact they enjoy by looking at their children 's enjoyment . <\s>
<s> Another reason is when a person become old , many of the people will suffer from various health problem , even those problems make them dull and hamper their enjoy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , I always observe two of my neighbour 's children . <\s>
<s> They always wanted to visit some or the other place to visit . <\s>
<s> They never bother for their studies . <\s>
<s> Whenever I ask them why do not they bother for studies and always wants to roam here and there , they always give me one answer , this is only the time to enjoy , once we become little older , then need to serious about careen and then marriage , then family extention and then taking care of them , so we never be free of problem to enjoy as we are now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In a nutshell , I do agree that young people will enjoy lot when compare with older , because they are free from responsibilies and problems . <\s>
<s> They are healthy and more energitic . <\s>
<s> I think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> In fact ; you may come across few situations that some people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> But you ca n't see this kind of people generally . <\s>
<s> Because they are very clever and hardworker than the normal people . <\s>
<s> If we talk about in general except this kind of people , I agree with the statement about specializing in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason of this choice is that the concentration on one subject is easier than more subjects . <\s>
<s> you can focus on that subject , make good preparations and think much ways of that subject many times . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second you may not have much time for being qualified in many subjects . <\s>
<s> So you can spend your time only one subject and get more information and make yourself well educated about that subject . <\s>
<s> Otherwise , you are supposed to dividing your time and power all the subjects that you interest in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , you may pay a lot of money for that . <\s>
<s> And you wo n't be well qualified in ne subject . <\s>
<s> And all you know will be on the surface of those subjects . <\s>
<s> You can never go deeper about the subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fourth , when people ask you your professionallity , are you going to say to them `` I have broad information many subjects but not one particular field . '' <\s>
<s> ? <\s>
<s> It will be funny . <\s>
<s> So if you want to be admitted from the universities or the academic environment , you have to meke yourself professional in one subject . <\s>
<s> Otherwise they wo n't approve your abilities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , you have to choose one subject that you realy like and adapt yourself very well and try to be qualified in that subject . <\s>
<s> You will see that you make the right chose . <\s>
<s> The understanding of ideas and concepts is one of the most important reasons for education of youth people . <\s>
<s> I am strongly agreed with this statement so that all the facts have an origin in an idea . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the first place , the importance of understanding our history and facts does not only depends on our knowledge of the facts , but also the comprehension of why all of the things are and was happening in our world . <\s>
<s> The World War II was the most cruelty war that humankind has ever suffered as a result of millions of victims in both parts . <\s>
<s> Beyond these atrocities there were awful ideas of how to rule the world . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , I can see the reasons of bringing a country to the war as the United States did to that war . <\s>
<s> The US could see people have thier natural rights which are inherited to human being such as freedom or religion . <\s>
<s> These are ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , we use ideas and concepts not only to find out facts , but also to learn about our future problems and facts . <\s>
<s> Math is a science that you have to understand theories and concepts to solve the problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third and finally , I think ideas and concepts create a critical inspiration to the society , which makes us better observers of the world . <\s>
<s> In this case , we should to recognise the roots of poverty to improve this world and the ideas and concepts can bring these solutions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think the more ideas and concepts we understand , the better comprehension of world we have . <\s>
<s> It is more important to know the why than to know because and the same fact , because history can repeat the same idea <\s>
<s> The various educational systems all over the world permit students to specialize more or less late . <\s>
<s> That leads to a tricky issue : is it better to specialize early in the studies or later ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I disagree with people who think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize . <\s>
<s> It is true that it is necessary to have knowledge in several topics before specializing . <\s>
<s> For instance , children have to learn about geography , history , biology , maths ... <\s>
<s> This permits tu realize what we like to study and what we would like to do to work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But , I am convinced that in order to be efficient in the work , we have to know specific things in one specific area . <\s>
<s> For instance , I made an internship in a hospital last year in the area of finance . <\s>
<s> So as to understand the reasons why some medicines have been bought more that year , I had to ask to nurseries . <\s>
<s> The latter knew the use of these medicines . <\s>
<s> But on the contrary I knew about budget and accountancy . <\s>
<s> So , as it is impossible to learn about everything , we have tu specialize in one field . <\s>
<s> And , in the company , working with the cooperation of the other members of the staff is necessary to work with efficiency . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , specializing in one subject do nor prevent us from being interested in other subjects . <\s>
<s> But it is uneccessary to have a high level of knowledge in these fields , it can be just for leisure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects contains a risk . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact , I tend to think that it prevents us from having a high level of knowledge in all these areas . <\s>
<s> Consequently , we would be less good at our work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , I bare in mind that it is better to specialize in one subject rather than in many subjects . <\s>
<s> KNOWLEDGE <\s>
<s> The humankind always need knowledge to reach good life standarts . <\s>
<s> Therefore knowledge is very important aspect of humanslife . <\s>
<s> Some think that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in on specific subject . <\s>
<s> In contrary to those people some think that its not a good idea . <\s>
<s> I personally agree with the first idea . <\s>
<s> These are my following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , knowledge is a part of our life we make evrthing with our knowledge because we use our brain before doing something . <\s>
<s> If we specialize in one specific subject we cant do anything about the another subjects , so its better to have broad knowledge . <\s>
<s> For example , I know english very well but I dont know anything about spanish so I can speak only english , i can read only english but if i know another language with english it can be better for my life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , if you have broad knowledge you can do whatever you want , you can discuss something with other people so it improves you life standarts . <\s>
<s> For instance you have a job and you are good at your job maybe you think you are the best about it but if they kick you , you try to find a new job but everywhere will ask you something for example what do you about this topic discuss me or something like that so you know lots of things about everything in our world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , all in all as I said before if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject you will be better than other people who are specialize in one specific subject and Im sure you will win lots of things if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you will see . <\s>
<s> Evry one of us dreams of enjoying his life during all his living period untill his last day . <\s>
<s> But I personaly think that young people enjoy life more tha old people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fisrt young people have less responsiblities toward the familiy , so they have much more liberty to do what they want and to go wherever they perefer . <\s>
<s> They could enjoy their life by traveling or taking risk in some adventure , doing dangerous things or crazy things , while old people have their families and their responsibilities to take into account . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people also could go to some entertainment places with their mates such us pubs and diskotecs where there is so much noise that the old people could n't bear . <\s>
<s> There is also some nice places that are open exclusively for young people , old people are note permited to enter them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An other point to be mentioned it is the health issue , young people are generaly healthiest that old people , and this make them able to enjoy many things in life for example , lasting at night , playing some amazing sports like cars speed or jumping in mountains . <\s>
<s> They could also afford working hard and having an extra Job to gain more money that help them to entertain them selves . <\s>
<s> They could also travel to any place without reservation because they are in good health so they could bear long trips , they do n't fear that the whether would be hot or cold , they could bear it anyway because they are still young and they have strong health . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I think young people enjoy life more than old people . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement the importance of understanding ideas and concepts than learning facts . <\s>
<s> Why do we learn ? <\s>
<s> what is the purpose of learn ? <\s>
<s> In my opinien , it is to develop from learning and to make advance . <\s>
<s> Throughout several exemples will define the reason of importance of understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Business marketing is can be another exemple . <\s>
<s> Before I learned marketing in the school and I have got good grade that time because I could well memorize everything learned in the class . <\s>
<s> However when I had internship in the five star hotel marketing department I was embarassed , because before I did not understanding marketing concepts and ideas in ths subject I forgot almost knowledge before I acquired . <\s>
<s> After that happening I read marketing book and tried to understand and applied in real marketing situation . <\s>
<s> Through the process understanding ideas and concepts I could develope the marketing plan and apply marketin theories with modification the company situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is another exemple with development of science , we learn sience in the school but if we just learn that it does not mean anything . <\s>
<s> All facts in the textbook are like about history of sience . <\s>
<s> With just the knowledge what can we do ? <\s>
<s> However , through understanding the consept and ideas , we have some quriosities and exemin that we have developed science . <\s>
<s> Acient people belived the earth is plat however some sientist understand and the ideas about that was not true they could find the fact eathis round . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Those tw exemples support the reason of agreement with this statement . <\s>
<s> After the World War II , the development of the influstructure especially the development of the car have increased rapidly . <\s>
<s> However the perspectives of people who are using cars changes gradually in recent years . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , the use of cars in twenty years will be decrease as the development of the influstructure and technology . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , there are a lot of people who are concerning about the impact of using cars to the environment . <\s>
<s> In some countries such as in Netherland and China , they work on the policy of using bicycles to avoid producing Carbon-dioxide gas , which possibly damages the natural environment . <\s>
<s> However , there are some countries that says CO2 gas is not neseccarry for damaging the environment , therefore it is not always a majorities idea of decreasing the number of using cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second of all , there are more public transportations such as busses , trains and air transportations are developping by new technology . <\s>
<s> For example , there are many railways in Japan to transform people one place to the other faster and more convenient . <\s>
<s> Also in Taiwan and China , they built the Bullet train or maglev train which transport group of people at once , and also think about the impact on nature . <\s>
<s> Also in the less economically developped countries such as the countries in African region , it would be harder to get car for individual residences due to the civil war and poorvaty , it is important to produce the cheap public transportation for them . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I think the increasing number of car users will not be occured in the LEDCs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third of all , since many countries of more developped countries such as in Singapore , Japan and Switherland , the decreasing in number of child becomes a sesrious problem . <\s>
<s> In these countries , the government are likely to set the law to get more than four people to ride the cars , therefore the number of the cars might decrease gradually . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Since the time passed , people 's perspectives of using car changing . <\s>
<s> I think this fact would make the number of cars fewer than now . <\s>
<s> The art of making advertisements is one of the most important things to sell a product nowdays . <\s>
<s> People of this century is really involve in the advances of tecnology ; so , instead of reading a book , most of us are watching television or navegating by internet . <\s>
<s> This tecnologies , and also the street , is full of advertisements and we ca n't avoid seen or listenining them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As I said before , we are all the time in touch with advertisements and I think that this way of salling a product is the one that gives more benefits to a company . <\s>
<s> Thats why I agree that companies do their best to announce their products in the andvertisements better than they are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , you can see and advertisement of a shampoo that sais that it would `` leave your hair very straight and soft '' as the model that they show . <\s>
<s> As a fact , you can be sure that the moldel did n't only use the shampoo to look beautiful , but the company needs to reflect how people wants to look like and they will use other products to get the best impression on the audience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We have to be very careful with advertisements because as I said , in most of the casses they are not showing the truth . <\s>
<s> Most of the time are a strategy of marketing of the product and , if we are clear about it , we wo n't get dissapointed when the product do n't have the quality that the advertisement shows . <\s>
<s> Life is a gift from god and one has to enjoy it . <\s>
<s> However , life enjoyment differs from one to another depending on budgets . <\s>
<s> Besides it differs from young and old peolpe . <\s>
<s> In this essay , I am going to show that young people enjoy life more than old ones because of health and age diffrences . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young peple enjoy life more than older people , since yong peple are more healthier than old ones . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact , young people are vivid ; that is to say , they are full of life ; they , indeed , can travel long distances enjoying the beauty of the land scape without any complaint . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , old people cannot travel such distances they easily get tired . <\s>
<s> Adding to that , young people can do other activities , such as going to the disco , swimming or hiking . <\s>
<s> Olders , on the contrary , prefer sleeping or taking a nap rather than amusing themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Old people do not enjoy their life like young people because of age . <\s>
<s> Some old people think that during their youghts they enjoyed their time and believes that the remaining of their life should be devoted to their children . <\s>
<s> Therefore , their main concern is to see their children 's improvement from childhood to adulthood . <\s>
<s> Thus , old people think that their role is to serve their children at the expense of their enjoyment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , I think that old people , specially parents are great , as they devote their time for their childern rather thanenjoying their time like young people . <\s>
<s> Some people believe that the number of the cars will decrease , while others do not think so . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , the total amounts of the cars will diminish largely because the people gradually realize that too many cars will cause serious problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason for my viewpoint lies in the fact that nowadays more and more importance and attentions have been attached to the problems cause by cars . <\s>
<s> For example , the cars caused the serious environmental problems like the air and water pollution . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the cars cause too much noise which largely affect our sleeping and study . <\s>
<s> In addition , the increasing cars have used a relativley high rate of the precious oil on which our quotidian life and industry development depend . <\s>
<s> These detrimental problems brought about by the cars , if not handled in time properly , will lead to a series of severe consequences . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Luckly , we have seen a lot of endeavors and efforts to solve the problems of cars by both the government and public . <\s>
<s> For instance , the government has offered enough financial support for a lot of scientists to invent new vechiles . <\s>
<s> What 's more , the media like the newspapers are trying their best to call for the public and the students to ride the buses to go to work . <\s>
<s> These efforts may be effective to decrease importance of the cars and reduce the total amounts of the cars in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , we should not ignore or underestimate the difficulties involved in the reducing the numbers of cars . <\s>
<s> The cars is one of the most effective and convinent way of trip . <\s>
<s> Many people want to purchase a car because they want to work or go anywhere anytime . <\s>
<s> They will not be restricted by many outside factors . <\s>
<s> They may think the car as the status of the themselves in the society and do not take into account the cars in a pratical way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , the issue about the cars is the a complex one that needs the analysis on the case-by-case basis , accordingly all three reasons mentioned above intertwine to form a whole organic becoming more persuasive that any of them . <\s>
<s> In the final analysis , though the danger of cars call more attentions increasingly , it is also important for us to change the feeling of the cars in the public ' mind to reduce the nuymbers of the cars . <\s>
<s> Now , cars have become very convinient tools in our life . <\s>
<s> We can move anywhere if we have a car at least in our house . <\s>
<s> However , I agree with the opinion . <\s>
<s> There are thee reasons why I think so . <\s>
<s> First , reducing cars tend to decrease of the amount of harmful gass . <\s>
<s> Recently , we are facing to the problem such as glorbal warming , air poolution , and many other ploblems . <\s>
<s> I am surely thinking that these problems are becoming worse and worse , and finally , we may face the serious situation someday . <\s>
<s> S Decreasing cars cause to improve these problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , becoming fewer cars can also abolish the noise problem . <\s>
<s> Residents in the central city may trouble with the problems because there are a great deal of cars are running close their houses . <\s>
<s> If cars become fewer , complaining about these noisy environment become fewer at the same time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , it can also reduce the rate of car crash accidents . <\s>
<s> According to the resent reseach , the death rate is becoming higher and higher by many tipes of car accidnts . <\s>
<s> To increase the cars rate also invite the producing the high rate of the car accidents . <\s>
<s> If the amounts of cars reduce , we can reduce such a terrible accident before hand than now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , I storonglly agree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> Certainly , life of using car is very useful , but there are many demerit as well as these convinient points . <\s>
<s> If we do n't have cars , we surely can find the other ways in twenty years . <\s>
<s> As far as my view is concern i am disagree with statement . <\s>
<s> As the old saying goes `` Jack of all trades is Master of none '' , I believe on the following proverb . <\s>
<s> What I feel is you should concentrate on the one traget rather than trying your hands on too many target without pondering on its prose and con . <\s>
<s> If you do so it would only lend you in a big trouble in the long run , so it is better to play safe . <\s>
<s> My father alway taught me that if you would able to concentrate on your main aim , you would surely get success . <\s>
<s> For example-if we take the example of shooting any target , If you concentrate on that target while shooting then there would be higher chance of accurate shoot but if your concentration loose and it diverts from the main target then that would have surely negative result . <\s>
<s> Although , innovation is main key to success but you can also try your skill in the things you already know as that would be better ( in the sense of positive result ) and safe . <\s>
<s> If you are not expertise any work then how would you get success to the fullest , it would be better to enjoy the positive result then a negative result . <\s>
<s> Every human being want to become perfect at every front of life-Professional , Social and Educational , but he or she would be able to do so by giving hundred persent to each work . <\s>
<s> For example if a person who already has business of his own which is running well-off but that business is older and he want to establish a new business that is not familiar to him and which is the fastest and innovative in the market , so the main essence is that how could he establish that business . <\s>
<s> In this certain situation i would only recommend him to rennovate the establish business . <\s>
<s> If we look at another example a student has a interest in engineering say electronics and telecommunication and at that time the field of medical has immense opportunities so he cannot able to adapt the medical field all he can do is just pursue the field which relates his field with the medical taking subject like medical imagindg system an <\s>
<s> In my opinion it is more important to understand ideas about a lesson . <\s>
<s> I believe that students has to focus on main concept of issues . <\s>
<s> By learning facts , students can gain only the information . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As for me , first reason for it that when students focus on the main idea of any lesson , they might improve the idea , and they can add different types of ideas to it . <\s>
<s> Because i think that younger brains usually open for creativity . <\s>
<s> So if a teacher depends on teaching facts , he/she may cause lost of creativity in class . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My second reason is , if students think about concepts and try to understand the idea , they can produce questions to teacher . <\s>
<s> So when they are asking these questions , they may understand and learn all the facts of lesson . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the class , if teachers pay attention on giving the main idea , they can help to raise in numbers of innovative individuals . <\s>
<s> Because i believe that any student who ask questions by using `` how '' and `` why '' can learn all structure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When i was in high school we had two chemistry teachers in one year . <\s>
<s> Our first chemistry teacher always asking elements properties whose students has to know from periodic table . <\s>
<s> So we should know all elements from that table . <\s>
<s> Otherwise we sure that we ca n't pass the lesson . <\s>
<s> After his retirement , we had a new teacher for chemistry . <\s>
<s> She was always giving research homeworks in the class . <\s>
<s> Also we had to prepare projects with our classmates . <\s>
<s> After that we got start to understand that how chemistry and it 's theories works . <\s>
<s> We were staying in library for hours . <\s>
<s> We were reading articles about our homeworks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end of the year we gained a scientific point of view . <\s>
<s> And now , it 's really hard to remember of any elements from periodic table . <\s>
<s> As it is rightly stated by someone that ` PREVENTION IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN CURE ' . <\s>
<s> The world is looking to this by saving and preventing the extreme use of natural resources . <\s>
<s> So I definitely agree with the idea or statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> To support this I would like to state few of my views as follows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my coutry like India , where there is tremendous population and for travel purpose there is enormous number of vehicles . <\s>
<s> More vehicles talk about the private vehicles especially cars , which is used as mode of transport for the entire family , or say individual car for each family member . <\s>
<s> Just imagine what do they do ? <\s>
<s> They only add to the pollution of the environment . <\s>
<s> As in air , noise and water pollution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It does not only add pollution but also wastage of natural resources like petrol and diesel . <\s>
<s> And for this we have to depend on the gulf countries . <\s>
<s> Wherein it is only upto the economical crisis , which indirectly is seen in hiking prices of petrol . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What when this resources gets over , traveling will not only become expensive with other alternatives but also impossible one day . <\s>
<s> Some western country have accepted the fact and started more conventional , cheaper and better way of traveling . <\s>
<s> Like traveling on cycles to their work places , places where they have to visit often . <\s>
<s> By cutting down on air and noise pollution , I think that 's a very wise decision one can take , in order to prevent future problems . <\s>
<s> Also travelling on bicycle , one can do cycling exercise everyday which is always good for one 's health . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that it is smart decision , if taken by our govrnment can prove tremendously useful well on which government is already thinking . <\s>
<s> And be a ` stepping stone ' to prevent hazardous problem . <\s>
<s> And with this thinking and implication in future definitely I think that there be reduction in private vehicles especially the cars in next twenty years . <\s>
<s> Its true that humen is totally depending on the power of vehicle to move from one place to another . <\s>
<s> Transportation has made human day to day life more easy than before . <\s>
<s> In ancient days as people used to walk to cover distance from one part to another , now use of cars and other transpotations made it much eaiser . <\s>
<s> Motor cars are usefull to take three to four or more peoples to one place to another . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I disagree with the point that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I feel that use of car wont be fewer in another twenty years . <\s>
<s> If we take an example technology has improved so much that now most of the middle class family is affording to have a four wheelar with new models but same time those people who have old Ambasedor or Fiat cars dont want to change their old models after so many years also . <\s>
<s> So their can be chances that after twenty years when technology will come up with new things and modalities for transpotation , there will be lot of people who will like only to use cars . <\s>
<s> And also the poor people who are able to afford only motorbike can use cars after twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Same times there also can be possibilities that after twety years when science will come up with new inventions and helicopters and planes can be available in cheeper rates as like todays any of the four wheelar or if their fair will reduce to normal train or bus fair then sure there will be less use of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I want to state that my agreement or disagreement with this topic hardly matters . <\s>
<s> Only the thing matters is how much technology has improved and how its helping to normal or below middle class people for their transpotation . <\s>
<s> There some differences between young people and older people . <\s>
<s> I want to explain important points that their characteristics . <\s>
<s> First , young people are more active because they have to go to school , they have to learn what their requirment . <\s>
<s> They also have to grew to become what they want to be . <\s>
<s> Though , they are grewing up , there are a lot of sturuggles that they have to face to it . <\s>
<s> They are confused and lost because they can not see what is going to happen next . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , think about older people are more calm and have knowledge , go done though that their development . <\s>
<s> They can do whatever they want to do because they finish high school . <\s>
<s> They may have time to think about their grand children who they got . <\s>
<s> But there are things that they can not do which is going to school , playing sports over beyond their avarage , being expart at some thing new . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So some limits coming up to them because their age is increasing . <\s>
<s> But it doesnt mean that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , if you want to have own time like relaxing , sleeping , talking with friends , seems like young people have time to those kind of stuff , but young people may not do it becaue there are a lot of things to do like home work , sports club , planning for university or job . <\s>
<s> But older people may do it because they have time , maybe they are having job that they really want to do . <\s>
<s> School wark is hard to have fun , there are such a limit time , they are still struggling with everything . <\s>
<s> Older people can enjoy what that young people enjoy , if they want to play sports as much as that young people do then they can do it . <\s>
<s> Young people can not do it exactly same thing as old people do . <\s>
<s> They have future to enjoy and older people are enjoying that future right now . <\s>
<s> In some communities , society have main projects of helping others by having help centers and certain committees to focus on specific needs of the society and try to offer the required help in that field using young people as employees or volunteers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But those young people do n't have to be part of those establishments to help their communities . <\s>
<s> They could do this by helping themselves first in educating themselves and having energy to fulfill their goals which takes them to helping their communities also indirectly . <\s>
<s> But these days young people do n't have enough time to do that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Reasons are because they are engaged in other stuff which keeps them busy not to help . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately most young people do think that the end of their studying journey is to get a job and in turn to earn money . <\s>
<s> Even if they would not just go for this process a minority may consider thefts and turn into criminals only because of their lust for money . <\s>
<s> Some young people are engaed so much in their jobs to an extent that they would not find time for their families . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , Some are really having a job only because it is a must have thing which should be accomplished may be under pressure of family and every morning they drag their feet into work forcefully . <\s>
<s> May be if they had an option they would have been quitting jobs and staying at home amusing themselves and having pleasure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If young people out there thought right , considering their jobs , they would have alot to get in advantage to themselves , their families and communities . <\s>
<s> The given statement is , `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . <\s>
<s> Most of the people agree with this statement as the present generation has much advanced environment for entertainment and lots of new places to hang out in groups . <\s>
<s> I like to disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As i have mentioned in the earlier paragraph , it might seem as if younger people enjoy life more than older one does . <\s>
<s> But that is not true according to my concern . <\s>
<s> In the present generation one could notice that the technology have been improved and has lead to the next level in advancement . <\s>
<s> This , in addition increases the studies in science and in other areas . <\s>
<s> In order to compete in the world , young people have to study more and automatically spends more time working , in order to improve the skills . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would like to add the phrase , Work hard and enjoy later . <\s>
<s> If a person enjoys life in his young age , he definitely cannot compete with the future generation and hence suffer in his old age . <\s>
<s> But in the case of a person who works hard in the young age , can make good fortune so that he would lead a safe and peaceful life in the later age . <\s>
<s> Also . <\s>
<s> only at the young age , people would be physically fit compared to to the aged ones and furthermore have good stamina to do hardwork . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would like to add a real time example to support my statement . <\s>
<s> All the personalities whom we have hear 'd and come across in our life would have worked hard in their early ages . <\s>
<s> I think everyone would accept this fact . <\s>
<s> I would like to point out a person known to me who is leading a happy and fortune life . <\s>
<s> In his early age , he use to work at textile factory based on daily wages . <\s>
<s> There he studied his work keenly and worked hard so that he became permanent employee and got promoted . <\s>
<s> Later with his knowledge , that he gained from his experience he started an individulal unit outside that manufactured the spare part which the company is , frequently in need of . <\s>
<s> Now he is one of the major supllier of spare parts for that company . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Any person who lives prosperous life and who is assumed to be one of well known personality would have worked hard in their earlier life . <\s>
<s> Thus working hard in early time gives fruitful results that makes people enjoy ther later life period . <\s>
<s> I I totally agree with this statement for many reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , our ailing planet is in a bad state and I think that people will realize that we have to halt destructive pratices . <\s>
<s> Cars emit greenhouses gases which are partly responsibles for pollution and global warming . <\s>
<s> I believe that governments of developped countries will carry out measures in order to cut greenhouses gas emissions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some say argue that my point of view is not realistic but I think that natural related disasters like drought , coastal flooding caused by a rise in sae level .. <\s>
<s> .0 will convince people to find alternatives energy and ways of transportation and use public transportations . <\s>
<s> I think really that it is possible to sensitive people to environnemt problems . <\s>
<s> To support my point of view we can cite the exemple of hurricane Katrina which has showed to the wehole word that it is urgent to decrease pollution otherwise we will have serious problems in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , on my opinion an increase of oil cost will encourage people to walk or to use public transportations . <\s>
<s> Indeed oil is scarce and it will become more and more difficult to find and extract it . <\s>
<s> Until now , the high prize of oil has been responsible for some economic crisis . <\s>
<s> Moreover , there are no other energy souces which can entirely be used instead of oil . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason of my opinion is that thingsd are always changing and I believe that we we will find more interesting tranportations and that researchers will succeed in imagining more pratise , faster transportations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> tO SUMUP , i THIN <\s>
<s> Many people prefer to travel in groups led by a tour guide , and other people prefer to travel individually . <\s>
<s> There are many advanatges for both methods that I have to take in consideration when I plan to travel and especially when I plan to make a touristic tour to a certain country . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On one hand when I travel with a group led by a tour guide , I am limited with the place indicated by the tour guide . <\s>
<s> However , if I travel individually I can make my own plans and I can go any where I want to visit . <\s>
<s> Moreover , I am not only limited with the places but also with the time that the tour guide indicate to stay in one place . <\s>
<s> If I travel individually , I can spend more time in one place that I like more than other place . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , travelling with a group led by a tour guide will be more organized . <\s>
<s> Therefore , regarding the schedule of the trip , the tour guide will make a plan in order to visit the maximum number of places in the country . <\s>
<s> However , If I am alone , I might miss some important places to visit . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , the tour guide might provide me lot of information about any touristic site , while I can not get these information from any other sources during the trip . <\s>
<s> In the meantime , during a trip with a group . <\s>
<s> I might take advantage of making some relationships and making some friends . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , it will be a good opportunity to interact with people from different nationalities and different cultures . <\s>
<s> So I will be able to practice my languages with them and we might go out and have fun together during the free time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , If I travel alone , it will be a good chance to relax and have some silent moments with myself . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , I need calm after long period of working hard . <\s>
<s> For example , I will choose to spend some times on the beach , looking at the sea and enjoy the sound of the waves and the weather , this is a relieve for my stress . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Giving the advantages of boyh methods , I belive that when I go for a trip , I should organize the time in such a way that during some days I have to join a group with a tour guide and some days I will need to stay alone . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I will get double benefit from my trip : Relaxing and expanding my knowledge about the country I visit . <\s>
<s> I agree to that statement . <\s>
<s> because young people have more power than older people but they have no experiences . <\s>
<s> and young people do not know how to use their energy wisely . <\s>
<s> so they behave which they want to do . <\s>
<s> Most of that is playng . <\s>
<s> but i 'm not sure that playng out side , dance and play video games are enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> There 's few people that working hard is enjoying their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people have not to work earn money , they only know about spend money . <\s>
<s> but older people have to make money , most of them have family . <\s>
<s> they have to make money and save them . <\s>
<s> so older people know that enjoy life when they are adult is going to bankrupt . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But young people do not have to worry about that . <\s>
<s> Study is the biggest enemy of young people , but many of them do not know If they study hard , they can enjoy life more than young people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When i go to the shopping mall or something like that , there are many young people more than older people . <\s>
<s> some young people spend more money than older people , play a lot , and have a party with their friend . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But many older people think that enjoy life is not bad for young people so they let their children play . <\s>
<s> But if older people have the time like young people they might be enjoy their life like young people . <\s>
<s> Older people want to enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> There are many older people that enjoy their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people enjoy their life more than older people , but i wish young people study hard during the childhood and enjoy their life when they become a success man . <\s>
<s> It is better than play during the childhood and become fail about their job . <\s>
<s> I saw many wise people that study hard , do not play and be a successful . <\s>
<s> Knowledge is the biggest treasure that you can ever achieve . <\s>
<s> But is it important to have a braod knowledge of many subjects or is it better to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> You can earn more acknowledgement if you know as much as possible in one subject . <\s>
<s> That can be explained in many reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , when you are a specialist in one subject , it is more possible to go deeper in the material . <\s>
<s> You can do a scientific research and firgure out why are these or this problem . <\s>
<s> With that knowledge it is possible to investigate things . <\s>
<s> For example , if you are in the economic word you are able to understand what happens . <\s>
<s> This could not work if you only know a few methods . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , people , which you make a academic conversation , have really more trust in you , when you have deeper knowledge . <\s>
<s> When talking about the dollar 's weakness against the euro , it does not make sense to talk about it without that specific kwnowledge . <\s>
<s> You are able to discuss and to investigate . <\s>
<s> People almost ever argue to each other on a high level . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand having braod knowledge of many subjects can be puzzling sometimes . <\s>
<s> Keep in mind that you have a lot of knowledge . <\s>
<s> It could be difficult to explain something when you are not certain about the problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion i mean knowledge in one specialize subject is the best way . <\s>
<s> You are a raelly specialist and you can always be certain what you are talking about . <\s>
<s> Therefore people will have more trust in you . <\s>
<s> Success is one of the courages that make people to take risks in the different layer of the life . <\s>
<s> I believe that sucessful people try new things and take risks more easily comparision to the unsuccessful people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to my view success encourages people and make people to handle the hardships of the new subjects or the areas that they are going to face with . <\s>
<s> For example Paris Hilton , one of the sucessful person in the world . <\s>
<s> She is not an actress , singer or movie maker but she takes place different part of the art . <\s>
<s> In each part ` she becomes sucessful . <\s>
<s> She is very popular for now . <\s>
<s> She has a single and people like her voice then she decided to be an actress . <\s>
<s> If she does not sucessful in the music sector , she can not decide to be actress to act in a movie . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But opposite to the Paris Hilton , Bill Gates who is the one of the sucessful person in the computer enginnering area , . <\s>
<s> He can not handle risks without calculating . <\s>
<s> Thereby it does not always seems that every sucessful people try new things , some of them may choose only doing what they are already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We might acknowledge that success make people to believe themselves . <\s>
<s> each successful job make them to believe that they are always taking right decisions but I think it is only a belief . <\s>
<s> For example , Arthur Triumpth who is the owner of one of the biggest reat estate companies in USA . <\s>
<s> But in the history he faced with very serious economical problems due to being a risk taker . <\s>
<s> After real state business he has choosen to build a casiono and tries to manage it . <\s>
<s> But he did not take a toughtful considiration about what might be happened and he had bankrupcy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , success is one of the catolizer of life that lead us having chance to take risks . <\s>
<s> Unless we take the risks we can not figure out the areas that we are capiable of . <\s>
<s> May be success make us to concieve of about our choices . <\s>
<s> The examples that are given above show that successful people are the pinooers for new things and lover of risk . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts prepare the base of something that wants to be learnt . <\s>
<s> Learing from facts means to experience something and so it means to have a deep knoledge . <\s>
<s> Thus , from my point of view it is more important to learn from facts rather than to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> If not , you do not really know what you have learnt . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In order to learn something , the understanding of the ideas and concepts is an important thing . <\s>
<s> For instance , if you are learing about literature during a cert period of time , it is very important to understand the concepts that it ivolves such as the social context , the different author and the style of writing . <\s>
<s> This create an important background of knoledge about the literature but you do not learn everything because you do not read the literature . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In contrast to the above , if the facts are learnt a better understanding can be obteined . <\s>
<s> For example , instead of trying to undestand the ideas and concepts of this literature century , the option of reading the main books of this century should be taken . <\s>
<s> If the books of the main writers are read , the students will be able to infer a great deal of things so that a better understanding is reached . <\s>
<s> Most of the things that are learnt by isolated concepts and ideas can be drawn by a carefully reading of the most important authors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , if you try to learn facts you get the concepts and ideas that you would need to understand something while with the other way around is not possible . <\s>
<s> Thus , I think it is more important to learn from facts rather than ideas or concepts . <\s>
<s> No one can deny the importance of knowledge . <\s>
<s> However , to every person , no matter how clcver he or she is , it is ipossible to know everything in the world . <\s>
<s> So most of us will face the problem to choose what to learn , and there comes the saying that it is better to have a broad knowlege of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Personally , I do n't think it a wise choice . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A broad knowlege seems to make people to look more intellegent , because whatever you talk about with him he will say `` Oh yes , I know ! `` or `` I have ever read it in a book . '' <\s>
<s> It appears that they know everything . <\s>
<s> Hewever does these `` Mr '' or `` Miss Know-all '' really understand what they 're saying ? <\s>
<s> After a further disscussion you will get the answer is `` No '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Due to the limitation of time and energy , it is almost sure that if a person tries to learn too much acdemic subjects at a time , the result would be he can grasp none of them well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A better way is to fosus on one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Maybe it is a little boiling but you can learn the nature of the subject . <\s>
<s> Specialization is what the modern sociaty asks for . <\s>
<s> When looking for jobs , the company will ask `` What you can do '' and you are supposed to have something that can not be taken placed by others <\s>
<s> The issue that in twenty years the number of cars in use will raise or drop is difficult to deal with because there are different arguments involved . <\s>
<s> Some people think that there will be fewer cars because of the environmental impact in wich the use of cars is sued . <\s>
<s> On the contrary the increase of the number of cars in use can be partly justified because the number of inhabitants on earth is still raising very fast . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most importantly , rejecting CO2 cars are responsible in a wide proportion for the atmosphere pollution . <\s>
<s> Every body knows the consequences of a high grade of CO2 in the atmosphere ; warmer temperature , climate changes and so on . <\s>
<s> So most of the governments , acting for the well being of its citizens , are writing new laws and inventing new solutions tending to reduce the use of cars . <\s>
<s> For instance , in paris , during the summer , only the pair or unpair patterns number are allowed to circulate . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , we can stress the lack of petroleum or gas resources today , and the raise of pump prices . <\s>
<s> As cars are big users of petrol , their utilisation involve that car owners have the financial power to pay it . <\s>
<s> As the resources are not eternal and prices are getting higher and higher , it seems as an evidence that the number of users will decrease in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another important argument would be that the automotive industry is very big enrgy consumer . <\s>
<s> Indeed , to make a car requires lots of products such as platsics or iron wich consumes a lot of energy to get in available form . <\s>
<s> Then the assembly chains , mostly composed by automatic machines consumes also a lot of energy . <\s>
<s> So , in the next years , governments will probably realise that providing very efficent popular transports would have a good impact on the country energy consumption . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , my strong belief is that even if the populattion is growing all around the world , the trend of environmental legislations in the prevalent car using countries will be to decrease the production and the traffic of this type of vehicles in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> I agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> In hte modern society , there are more and more entertaining resorts for young people to enjoy . <\s>
<s> Such as Wonderland in Canada , bars and club . <\s>
<s> The most important thing is young people 's ages and hearts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As the economics increase all over the world , everything is changing . <\s>
<s> The buildings , people 's dresssing , cultures , fashioness , and transportation . <\s>
<s> The reason the world is developing is all because the way modern thinking are changing . <\s>
<s> People 's lives are getting better and better every day , especially young people , since they live more in modern society . <\s>
<s> They have not esperienced the life during wartime . <\s>
<s> For example , the American scientific engineers are focusing on project about the building the longest abd excited train in the world . <\s>
<s> The train is very similar to the one we often play in Wonderland . <\s>
<s> And of courses it is more likely oftered to young people . <\s>
<s> I actually do n't that pld people can not go to that train to experience the happiness and excitedment . <\s>
<s> But use our common to think about it , if we do a survey in a city , we can calculate the percentage , how much percent of old people like to go to those places to have fun compare to young people ? <\s>
<s> Even though they actually go , i believe they will bring the kids or grandchildren there . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is another example , in North America , they build more and more bars and clubs only for young people , but for this situation , they have age limit , from age sixteen to eighteen . <\s>
<s> This is a very vivid example shows that the society cares about the young people about enjoying their lives and have fun . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , we do care about the old people as well . <\s>
<s> They would like to enjoy their lives and have fun too . <\s>
<s> But the way they enjoy their lives compare to young people , it is more silent . <\s>
<s> Instead going to those resorts , they rather just invite some friends to their houses to have some drink or just watch newpapers at home . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In then modern society , young people really enjoy life more than old people . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Some advertisements are thinking that to sell their products is the most important this is why they say any different things about the products even on the T.V and newspaper . <\s>
<s> Somethimes this things make people angry so much . <\s>
<s> But this thing also couse bad for themselfs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last time my mom was watching T.V. Then , a advertisements were talking about some stuff for study . <\s>
<s> He said that if you use this stuff , you can be so smart and remember so many things spanding just a week . <\s>
<s> He was so serious on the T.V and these stuff looked like really good for us . <\s>
<s> Then , my mom ordered the stuff for us . <\s>
<s> Few days later , we got it and tried to use it but it was not like on the T.V. Actually it was completely different . <\s>
<s> So my mom called the company . <\s>
<s> Finally we could get buck money but we were looking forward to useing the stuff . <\s>
<s> They made us so mud . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the same case , some people may state this thing to court . <\s>
<s> If they so , the company is going to lose . <\s>
<s> I heard that the guy , he bought really expensive car on the T.V . <\s>
<s> Because he did not have enough money to buy this car . <\s>
<s> On the T.V is usually selling more cheeper . <\s>
<s> But is was fake . <\s>
<s> So he impeached to court and fought against the company . <\s>
<s> Finally he won and got money from them . <\s>
<s> But even they know it , they continue to sell their products like that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for selling their goods . <\s>
<s> But it make consumers so mud and sometimes confused . <\s>
<s> They need to think more carefully about consumers as a some people . <\s>
<s> Just selling goods is so bud for people 's relationship . <\s>
<s> I think when people 's relationship is destroyed , the companys is also destroyed by themselfs . <\s>
<s> The problem of the new trade is directly connected to the fact that we must understand which products have really true effect , and which not . <\s>
<s> Today a lot of people go to supermarkets to buy their products , because in these places they can have a lot of chosen . <\s>
<s> At the same time we must take attention to what we buy , because a lot of products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Generally we buy an economic product because we think that it must have the same effect than one expensive , but I think that there is a reason if one is cheapper than another , and this reason is not only connected to the fact that one bring an important name , and another not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Generally when we buy a product that have a maior cost , meaning that we have buy a sicure object , that we 'll can use without any problem , also if we must remember that this is n't always treu , because we always find some surprises . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the contrary when we buy a product cheapper than another , we can find bed surprises . <\s>
<s> For these reasons I buy always products that are n't so cheapper , but also not expansive ; however it depents to what I must buy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When I buy a dress I want somethingh that give me a garancy of quality , and generally it 's directly connected to the cost of the object ; the same thingh happen when I must buy the meal , or somethingh for my house ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I prefer spend somethingh more when I buy a product that must during , and I spend less when I buy somethingh that does n't have much importance , for exemple somethingh that I 'm not sure that I will use a lot . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I 'm agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , and for this reason I try to do attention to what I but , trying to buy somethingh that has a middle cost among the products that I can find . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the same time I want remenber that it 's not always true that an expensive product is better then one that is cheap . <\s>
<s> I think to a large degree that the fact in the future there will be fewer cars in use than today it depends strectly on technological progresses . <\s>
<s> Having a look in to the past and comparing that situations with the one we are living today we can say that there were a lot of discovering processes that allowed the society to change its scenary . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact 30 years ago , referring to the modern era , the scenary was characterized by new hi/tech inventions in the field of mains of transports . <\s>
<s> in fact the airplane transportation existed since 1950 but increased immensely 30 years ago when people could travel around the world without problems . <\s>
<s> So , i think that if the technology continues to perform and to grows as it did in the past i can say that probably in the future we will have fewer cars than today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So i completely agree with the statement because i think that in the future people will not use anymore cars for any kinds of transportations needs , thanks especially to modern technology . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays if we have a look to modern cities we can see that people moves from a part of the city to another using underground . <\s>
<s> So i think that people will use fewer cars for differents reasons > First because they do not want to make the queue on the streets Second they replace cars with others mains of transports because they do not have to be concentrated in to driving . <\s>
<s> Third because in the future we will have better mains of transport , in fact we know that researchers are projecting a new type of train project . <\s>
<s> I am referring to the new train that will connect the Europe with America . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So this train will be positioned into a tunnel . <\s>
<s> the tunnel will be build under the sea that permit to the train to cross the ocean in only 9 hours . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So the future humans life will be very different from now . <\s>
<s> Are the successful people brave to take a risk or they are the people who keep doing what they already know without taking any risk . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , risks are needed for success and the risks mean to creat or try new thinks or thinking in a different way from other people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , if you do not take risk and keep doing things which you already know you are an average person and it is not that much significant , but a person who try new things can be easly realized . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , runing a business in a tradiniol way is normal and everybody does that but a person who make a big changing about the admistration of the bussiness can be take a great risk however there is an opportinity to become successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , people should work more harder to try new things so working hard can open a way to become successful as well . <\s>
<s> Finally if you take risks you have to challenge to other people becouse you already take risks and if you dont want to loose you should try harder to get success and this force also helps to you to become a successful person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At sum , <\s>
<s> I think the knowledge of a lot pf subjects forms the culture of each people . <\s>
<s> A person with a certain culture who is involved in a discussion , is able to speak with others of several issues . <\s>
<s> This means to avoid ignorance , and with this fact many purposes can be achieved . <\s>
<s> Someone who has a knowledge of many subjects can speak of everything , not feeling submitted to anyone because of lack of informations , or because he doesn \ t know what to say . <\s>
<s> This means people to feel more secure of themselves . <\s>
<s> It is interesting to enlarge the knowledge of a subject more and more , but it isn \ t always possible because of time and costs . <\s>
<s> So a person who is specialized only in a particular subject can speak only about that , feeling ignorant about the rest . <\s>
<s> It is also interesting to improve the knowledge of several subjects in order to form our personality and to find always other things to disvcover . <\s>
<s> If you only know a specific subject you don \ t know very much what surrounds you . <\s>
<s> With the knowledge of only one subject , you know a little , if you know less specifically many subjects , you know a lot . <\s>
<s> It is interesting to underline that a wide culture , the knowledge of many subjects , also gives people a sort of common sense , gives the faculty to understand properly what happens around them , something like consciousness . <\s>
<s> In fact the most advanced countries have a school system that goes through the knowledge of a lot of subjects , and only after that they have something improving the skill that regards each person future work . <\s>
<s> First of all you have to give the basis , then you can build something specific on them . <\s>
<s> If there \ s a lack of basis , there won \ t be anything else . <\s>
<s> In todays scanario it seems that cars are the important part of life and driving a car is status simble . <\s>
<s> By viewing the growth in production of cars and uses it seems that in future time all the ways are overcrowded by cars . <\s>
<s> But I believe that In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of Some strong reason like Fuel problem , awairness about pollution and health problem causing by cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fuels are limited on the earth . <\s>
<s> In world very small regions are known where fuel are found . <\s>
<s> Fuel are the main source of cars . <\s>
<s> Due to a large quantity of consumption the scarsity of fuel has been generated and the prices are growing up and up . <\s>
<s> So when fuel is ended their is no cars on the road and automatically reduces the cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now people are very well known about the harmfull effect of pollution which is causing by cars after the burning of petrol . <\s>
<s> It causes severe health problem like Asthama and other breathe related problem . <\s>
<s> People do n't want to take risk on their life . <\s>
<s> Pollution also causes the environmental changes by which all the inhabitants are affected . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And the last reasion that due to spending more time in car people are affectd with their back problem and getting fat which causes the disease . <\s>
<s> I would like to give an example that in recent newspaper study shows that due to using cars and lacking exercise 60 % people have suffering from back pain in the age of 30 . <\s>
<s> so when they consult with the doctor and knew about the reason most of them leave the cars and start the uses of bicycle . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although it is true that it seems very difficult that the cars are decreased in 20 year but most of the people thinking about bicycle which causes no pollution , and also good for health , also reduses the risk of accident are good for them . <\s>
<s> They also adappted cycles and certain countries the cars are also decreases due to awairness of people . <\s>
<s> So I belive that in twenty year there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I agree this statement . <\s>
<s> People who successed on business usually try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s> To begin with , only new ideas can success . <\s>
<s> An old idea woudl n't make you rich or popular . <\s>
<s> only new ideas do . <\s>
<s> people usually interested in new things because they think it is cool or trendy . <\s>
<s> For example , many people bought new types of video game like Wii or Playstation3 in Japan . <\s>
<s> Some people bought these games on impulse because the news programs or TV showed a great systeme about it and mede you buy it . <\s>
<s> Now , how about old type of vide games ? <\s>
<s> Will you buy it ? <\s>
<s> Answer is no even TV suggested it because you already know what is problem of thes old games and you can find out that TV 's information is not always correct . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that risky cahnce will be worth a lot . <\s>
<s> Many rich people tried vey hard to became rich . <\s>
<s> In another ward , the took many risks to aim their goals . <\s>
<s> So risks annd success is relating . <\s>
<s> If you took risks , you might fail . <\s>
<s> However , you might do well . <\s>
<s> When the risks that you took is greater , the prize is also great . <\s>
<s> That 's why people who did n't take risks would n't sucess . <\s>
<s> It is similler to gambling . <\s>
<s> For example , my uncle went to the casino last year . <\s>
<s> He first played a slot machines which needed only 10 cents . <\s>
<s> He won many times , but it did n't make him rich . <\s>
<s> Eventually , he lost 10 dollars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , Trying new thing and Taling risks would make you success . <\s>
<s> Successful people do n't do comon things and take small risks . <\s>
<s> Actually I disagree , Since learning facts is the main part of building an idias or concepts , which will be reflected on the amount of facts they learned . <\s>
<s> The much you learn and study about facts and information , The much the clear idias will be ready to speak out about . <\s>
<s> Many people sponsered an idais that do not stand or reflect any facts , These will be very fragil and will not found any field of practice since its not factual concepts . <\s>
<s> So in order to be in the way of good learning way we have to make sure we study the important basics and learn more facts in order to be able and more confedent to have a new idia and getting more advance in the field of knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For me , understanding idias is secondary to learning the other part of facts and information since not all idias are correct or in other way it is still a theory rather than approved facts , So concentrating on this veiw of teaching the student will be more important to be in the side of producing a logical and practical type of mentality and getting more beneficial idias as we reflecting all on facts and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Further the more , It is really interesting to explain that facts and concepts are only the way to understand all idias as with out these facts we can not progress to a matter of making theories and adopting a new concept in any field of life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students are more willing to learn when they feel they are standing on a solid base that help them to understand more idias and they can learn fast when they feel more confortable with the way of getting the informatin and this will be through learning facts first the understanding the concepts . <\s>
<s> I agree w ? <\s>
<s> th the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> The facts are forgetten easily but concepts and ideas are more permanent than facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When I was at high school I took lots of lectures that are h ? <\s>
<s> story , geography , maths , biology and etc . <\s>
<s> I was actually a successful student and all my exam grades were really high . <\s>
<s> however there was a problem . <\s>
<s> When I did not attend to the class I was stud ? <\s>
<s> ng before the exam , Actually I d ? <\s>
<s> d not learn subjects in detail just knew what they were . <\s>
<s> Thus I passed all the classes with high grades . <\s>
<s> When I came to university I recognized that I d ? <\s>
<s> d not understand many concepts well . <\s>
<s> I have just known the names or dates but why they are important is a question in my mind . <\s>
<s> Somet ? <\s>
<s> mes ? <\s>
<s> n class teacher asks someth ? <\s>
<s> ng that must be learned before but I cannot remember even the main points . <\s>
<s> The only lesson that I am favor ? <\s>
<s> n ? <\s>
<s> s maths which I really worked hard and examined many hypothesis and concepts deeply during high school . <\s>
<s> In many lectures I benefit from my knowlodge related to maths , so I am pleased to learn the maths well in the past . <\s>
<s> Furthermore it proves the importance of understanding ideas and concepts when working on something . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students cannot understand the importance of this matter themselves , so instructions should be responsible for teaching something in an understanting way . <\s>
<s> Advertisments is one of the best way to interact and interfere with the audience . <\s>
<s> There are many ways of advertisements and there are also different rules and views . <\s>
<s> In order to attract the people , customers in other word , the advertisment should be such a great and attractive show that makes the customer very forward to get and buy the products . <\s>
<s> This is why most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> There are two opposite opinion in this issue . <\s>
<s> One opinion is the advertisement should not be that great and much better than it is in real . <\s>
<s> The other opinion the advertisement s should be as much as it could be in real . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my point of view , if the advertisement were not much better than it is in real life no one will buy the products . <\s>
<s> If I decide to sell a products the first thing I should do before produce it is to have a big advertisements . <\s>
<s> Although it might be unfair for the costumers , it is a way to sell a products and succes . <\s>
<s> In additon , advertising is not easy as it is seems to some people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertising needs a creative smart people to creat a good advertisments . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , advertisement has both positive and negative side it may drive you to success and it may throw you to the ground , so sometimes it is very risky . <\s>
<s> For example , there is many mistake that makes factories loose alot of money because of a misusing of advertisment such Nike . <\s>
<s> The only technique that attract people is the advertisment and most people search for a products because not only it 's quality but also it 's advertisment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In short , advertisments is the only method that interact with people and costumers and it should have something really interesting on it . <\s>
<s> No one will buy a product if the advertisments shows the real thing about it it would be very boring and repel people from getting it . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement that Nowadays Young people should not participated in Community programs . <\s>
<s> Becuse nowadays most of the people are educated and they are realized and planning in what way they can help to the people . <\s>
<s> Recently Tsunami occured in srilanka , at that time group of engineers from india went to that place and helping for their construction of shelters and arranged the necessary goods like food , clothing for them . <\s>
<s> Because `` Servicing to the people is Servicing to the God '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , many colleges are part time colleges . <\s>
<s> So , students have enough time to participate in NSS ( National social services ) programs . <\s>
<s> Since government encourage this program in our country in such a way that every one should participate in cultural programs . <\s>
<s> I have also participated in NSS programs . <\s>
<s> When I was participted I was always `` Cloud nine '' . <\s>
<s> I gave suggestions to my friends and they are also participated in many activities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For other instance , Most of the american people participated in rebuilding of Afganisthan , most of them are young , Do n't you think ? . <\s>
<s> In my opinion Nowadays people motivate themselves , spend most of their past times for helping to the people . <\s>
<s> Because of formar legislators and politicians has explained how people should respond in critical situations . <\s>
<s> Finally I concluded that Nowadays young people undersand the situations and are very well respond in relative situations . <\s>
<s> Genarelaising there are two different academic education approachs : one belives that is better to have a brite general knowlege in differens felds , the other thinks it is better to specialize in a specific domain . <\s>
<s> Though both positions have good arguments I belive that it is better to specialize on one fiel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First we have to admit that if a student is accepted to a university he or her has be tought for around 12 years . <\s>
<s> Thus the school schould have jet given a general culture , and had to present a panorama of the differents subjects . <\s>
<s> This is why the student how enter in the university normally has already choosen his field of interess , and applies for a specific preparation in a scientitic sector . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondary we schould not forget the obiective of Univesity an of a student self is to create a proffessionist who is able to manage with his subject and eventually to reserch on it . <\s>
<s> Who could be possible to work and reserch on different not related topics in differents subjects ? <\s>
<s> Rarely have the human being the faculty to manage on an higt level competence and knowledges of many academical sectors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We normally citate Leonardo da Vinci as a exeptional genial inventor ... <\s>
<s> but of course .. <\s>
<s> he is an exeption . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude we schould integrate the specialization in a well based background of genar knowledge . <\s>
<s> But at the univerisity In my opinion is better to achive the skills and to denvelope the knowlegdes in one specific subject , than cultivate many subjects which knowledge are not deep enought . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concepts and leraning facts are important for students . <\s>
<s> However , In my opinion , I disgree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , we can learn ideas and concpets in class and our teacher , but sometimes they do n't work in the real society . <\s>
<s> For example , I worked in one restaurant before . <\s>
<s> When I cook the fish by following the recipes which our teacher taugh me , the chef blamed me . <\s>
<s> He said , `` Customers wo n't like what you cook by this way . '' <\s>
<s> The fact improved what he said is right because the people who ate the dishes I cooked went to complained to my boss . <\s>
<s> I was upset and depressed . <\s>
<s> From that day , i do n't believe the recipets I took in my class . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , sometimes facts is very cruel , but we need to accept them . <\s>
<s> That 's the reason why I regard facts are more important . <\s>
<s> For instance , I almost lost my job when I cooked the awful dishes by following the recipets . <\s>
<s> My boss told me that the fact was whatever you cooked , the most important thing was the customers liked it , especailly about work . <\s>
<s> What he said made me trust fact is the most significant factor again . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In short , I learned the precious lesson by realistic and painful experience . <\s>
<s> I would n't say that understanding ideas and concepts are useless or not important ; however , I really believe that it is more importnat for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> I strongly agree with the following statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' for the following reasons . <\s>
<s> In my opinion it is the best age to enjoy and also if we become old we cannot enjoy as much as we enjoy during young age and also during old age we will be thinking of children and also their career , settlement and marriage and become very tired and some times exhausted also and also in my opinion `` time is precious '' once it has passed it wo n't come again . <\s>
<s> And also another reason is that more enjoyment will there during young age and also we wo n't have that much energy we do have in young age . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main reason for which I am holding this opinion is , when I use to observe my parents they are always thinking of my education and career and also marriage and always they won ' t take care of their personal life and they take care of children in each and everything . <\s>
<s> I recognized this from the way they are taking care of me . <\s>
<s> Once we \ they become older and we \ they cannot enjoy as they enjoyed before . <\s>
<s> This is one reason for my opinion and another reason is that the same thing we use to talk with our close friends or relatives and so on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One example for holding this opinion is , I am having a very close friend and we use to share each and everything and we sometimes use to think of future and talk about it , then we have taken a decision that once we become old we cannot enjoy as we enjoy during young age because in young age we will not have any responsibilities and also we will have energy to do every thing and we will be mostly dependent on parents or if married early husband and also we will get from parents each and everything we want . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I want to conclude that in young age there will be more enjoyment that in old age and in old age we can mostly see love towards family but not enjoyment as in young age and also only oneting everyone look after in old age is happiness . <\s>
<s> For all the above reasons and examples I strongly agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy more than older people do '' . <\s>
<s> There are lots of people in the world . <\s>
<s> Some of them just do what they already exactly know how to do well because they affraid of doing something new . <\s>
<s> They find that it is risky and also they think to not succeed . <\s>
<s> However , the situation is a bit more different from just their tought . <\s>
<s> If you look life of so many today 's famaous successful people , you will easily see that they did not make only one job , they change over their jobs without affraid to not be successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do not give you a familiar example . <\s>
<s> I try to write life of my best friend and his decisions . <\s>
<s> Name of my friend is Ahmet . <\s>
<s> He was attended to Industrial engineering department of Marmara University . <\s>
<s> He gone to his school two years and one they he decided to change his department to Computer Sciences which is really different from his own department . <\s>
<s> Subsequently , he worked hard and indeed he also attended to that department which he had wanted . <\s>
<s> After he graduated , he start to work as a refree for soccer games which was directly diverse with his educational department . <\s>
<s> He took to step very rapidly and raised to linesman position of Turkish super league into five years . <\s>
<s> Do you understand now what i mean ? <\s>
<s> He made a lot of changes in his life . <\s>
<s> Eventually , he reaches the success . <\s>
<s> I think he may change its job someday in the future . <\s>
<s> However , I always believe that he will succeed whatever he does . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I want to tell be not afraid when you made decisions which affected whole your life . <\s>
<s> Only be diligent and make what you want to do . <\s>
<s> You see you can succeed just like Ahmet . <\s>
<s> I do n't go with the statement made . <\s>
<s> In the present day society , young people face a lot of challenges most important being of them being coping up with the competition in every field of study and in various sports in order to excel . <\s>
<s> They have to meet the anticipations of their parents and others from them . <\s>
<s> Inspite of all these the youth today are giving enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> The youth today are well aware of the various problems that are being faced by their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We know the disaster of ` Tsunami ' that struck south Asia a few years ago . <\s>
<s> In rehabilitation of these areas , youth from these countries played a crucial role . <\s>
<s> There were students from all over the country who not only gave financial aid , but also organized camps to do service . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my own college , we have a famous group called ` My Nation ' whose primary motto is lending a hand to the poor and needy in the nearby villages . <\s>
<s> All the members of this group are students . <\s>
<s> Their activities include distribution of clothes to the poor , conducting evening classes for uneducated , and even electrifying the surrounding villages ! <\s>
<s> Funds are raised by various events conducted and through donations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The youth are also aware of the political situations . <\s>
<s> In India , recently youth agitated against the decision of the Government to reserve seats in educational institutions on caste basis and they succeded to some extent . <\s>
<s> If someone is successful and wants to try new things and takes risks it is her or his decision . <\s>
<s> It is a big challenge because you do not know whether you will success in this new thing or not . <\s>
<s> Anyways , there are some positive aspects that we can look at . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , if people try new things it will be a challenge for them . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact they will learn new stuff and maybe they will get successful in this one also . <\s>
<s> The people who like challenging can get successful if they really want to learn something new . <\s>
<s> For example I took in highschool Fashion Design although I had never done it before and did not know how to work with it . <\s>
<s> Of course it was a challenge for me . <\s>
<s> I got successful in it because I wanted to do it and because I had fun . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason why successful people want to try more things is maybe they are bored of the things which they already know how to do well and always do . <\s>
<s> Maybe they know that they take risks but they try it and if it will not work than they try other things . <\s>
<s> My friend was so bored of being a babysitter and working as a babysitter . <\s>
<s> She tried to work in kindergarten but unfortunately it did not work and she still tries to find a new job which will be a challenge for her . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> You can whether take a risk or you get successful again . <\s>
<s> But it is a challenge and if you take a risk and it did not work than you know you can try other stuffs because there are thunds of stuffs out there that everybody can try if he or she really wants to . <\s>
<s> Some of the people are just successful in everything . <\s>
<s> Different people have different opinions that the advantage of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects compare to having specialize in only one subject . <\s>
<s> I strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many subjects is more benefical for social person and solve problems efficiently . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , more vast knowledge allow us to be social person . <\s>
<s> Although specific information render to think deeply , a lot of knowledge is more benefical to think widely . <\s>
<s> In our society , where gradually increase piece of information because of internet , haves and not haves of infomarion has a considerable gap . <\s>
<s> At this time , wide infomation is more essencial requirement for living in society . <\s>
<s> For example , when I was watch the program of Olympic game every 4years , I need to absorb about the role of each game to totally understand whether win or not . <\s>
<s> Morever , when face social issues such as green house , we should have a information several subjects such as the aspect of social , knowledge of science and the law of world for talking with others about them . <\s>
<s> This shows that if we do not want to be isolated person , we should have broad knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Next , broad knowledge of academic subjets is necessary for solving problems efficiently . <\s>
<s> When people have a problem whatever faced in life , they need to solve that for using many information . <\s>
<s> For example , when my parent were having a problem with sell a house , they had to gather many knowledge such as economic , law and enviroment . <\s>
<s> They wants to get a money by selling a house , so they had to consider to economical aspect in society . <\s>
<s> Moreover , they wished to reduce tax , that is why they should to learn about law . <\s>
<s> They also consdiered region of new house which they will transfer for more convenient life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more better . <\s>
<s> With this set of materials I 'm really disagree ! <\s>
<s> Cars will be fewer is a fantastic future ! <\s>
<s> In fact in the last years the number of the cars on a road is moltiplicated ! <\s>
<s> Only if an organization like a GOVERNMENT or much importatnt like ONU or NATO will make some mesuerd like a laws for this problem We will see fewer cars turn around ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My thesys is supported from the known of human mind ! <\s>
<s> Some years ago people every day walk , go by bike or take a bus for go to work , to study or to do other things ! <\s>
<s> Today man is able to buy a car and use it for his things , this because the world changed and are changing on ! <\s>
<s> Many years ago peolple got up in the morning and think what the best ways for find a food ? <\s>
<s> Later in the years when man got up think : <\s>
<s> How can i do for live better ? <\s>
<s> This is one of the means of evolution ! <\s>
<s> So , I 'm sure , next years peaple will think , for example , <\s>
<s> how many cars can i buy for live better ? <\s>
<s> Another example to support my opinion you can find in the last years . <\s>
<s> Family ten years ago has only one car for family , that father usually use . <\s>
<s> Today for each family you can find minimun two cars , one for a wife and one for a husband . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now number of cars are increasing and next years you will see better in one family every components of a family has a car ! <\s>
<s> I know some my friends that have two car for each one . <\s>
<s> The evolution can help us to find a ways for limite a pollution for example or increasy the useful of a car , but modern people want to have everythind to take with the hands ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The strange things is that this man or woman that does n't want to walk or take a bus or move , in the evening will go in a fitness center for have a physicol activity ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For this reason USA that is a rich country people are became fat ! <\s>
<s> In fact fact is one of the problem of modern socety . <\s>
<s> Because machines like a car are doing the all thing that man did before . <\s>
<s> So i think that that sentence is very funny and fantastic !!! <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . <\s>
<s> This is like this . <\s>
<s> Lot of youngr people are very enthusiastic about their young life to explore the new things so as to enjoy up to the maximum extent where as the older people who have experinced almost all the things in their life tend to relax in their older ages . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now , young people who are new to the world with new intentions like to spend their time in enjoying the life as much as possible like doing many things , such as going to the theaters to watch films and pubs every weekends to have fun , can play a lot of games together and even participate in high level tournaments , can have sex , can enjoy their university life as a student and many . <\s>
<s> Many of these things can also be enjoyed by the older people even but they are bored of doing them as they did a lot in their young life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Playing sports must need a lot of strength and energy which older people lack . <\s>
<s> Having a lot of parties with friends in young life is the other important thing to be considered which the older people may find it difficult to do as often as young people do and they also think that thay are a waste of money . <\s>
<s> To some extent even older people who are still interested will enjoy attending the parties and pubs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One more important thing is the student life , which will not be repeated again . <\s>
<s> Students enjoy a lot in the universities in many aspects such as sports , research and even in some other co-curricular activities . <\s>
<s> Older people cannot definately do that again , but can enjoy as a professor which is quite different from the student life . <\s>
<s> Students can experience the newer generatiions of life that has been changing gradually and they increase their expectations that suits the newer generations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As the younger people having more expectations on life and more resources than the older people had , I can strongly conclude that young people will definately enjoy more than the older people do . <\s>
<s> In our world , everything can be sell , from a coke , a chair and alcoholic drinks , to security services , hair brushers and even medicines . <\s>
<s> Television , radio and internet are ways of advertising a product . <\s>
<s> I agree with the fact that the majority of these advertisements make things seem so much better than they truly are and there are many reasons to think that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , in an advertisement that is presented on television , the product that is being promoted appears like if it is the best thing in the world , and most of the times , it is not . <\s>
<s> For example , when a company is trying to sell a soda , a coke , it presents a cold coke with some ice on it and a woman , because a woman sells better than a man , drinking it with passion , and at the moment that she feel the flavor , there is an explotion of excitement and refreshment , making you think that you need to buy one of those because it seems amazing . <\s>
<s> After you bought one , you get frustrated because it was not what they told you it will be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , if something that is for sale is really the best thing in the world , the people that sell it would not have to promote it very much , the people will buy it without anything that makes them do it . <\s>
<s> For example , you never see a computer or an effective medicine that are being promoted by showing a half-naked girl . <\s>
<s> On the contrary , they just tell you its characteristics , and sometimes they do not even show the computer to you . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , it is good to conclude by saying that we all have to pay a lot of attention to things that are advertised on the means of communication , we have to do this because we might buy something that , at the beginnig , we did not even want it . <\s>
<s> In addition , we have to be very careful and not let this people to wash our brains , instead , we should know what we really want and buy what we truly need . <\s>
<s> To be general , students can be childeren , teenagers or university students . <\s>
<s> All of them are not so matured , especially childeren , then teenagers , the last one university students . <\s>
<s> Becuase of being so young , they need to learn first , then they can think . <\s>
<s> In primary school , first they learn how to write and read . <\s>
<s> To provide communication and understand what it is going to happen in their environment . <\s>
<s> They try to learn writing and reading . <\s>
<s> After learning reading and writing they start to read all books , newspaper and to write a poem , a letter , a note etc. , they start to learn more in highschool either about classes or about being person . <\s>
<s> After high school they go to university and again they still need to learn a lot of things about life and about their major area . <\s>
<s> Because of these situations they need to understand ideas first then they can learn facts . <\s>
<s> If they understand ideas first they can think themselves . <\s>
<s> They can have their own personality . <\s>
<s> If we do n't teach different but good ideas in school , they can not learn the facts in true way . <\s>
<s> Because of that in school , they learn all classses like maths , chemistry , physics , biology , history , phylosophy , religion , health , etc . <\s>
<s> After taking these classes they understand that which area they like and which occupation they want to have in the future . <\s>
<s> After graduating university when they get a new job they face to real life and they start to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Because they have responsibility of new job and they earn their own money after all . <\s>
<s> They do not live their parents anymore and they live alone to take their desicion themselves . <\s>
<s> At that time they start to real things in life and maybe they will be worried about their future . <\s>
<s> Because of that they will want to be again a family and they will marry and have a child . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to my witings in the above , first students needs to understand ideas then learn facts . <\s>
<s> In my opinian it is the healtiest way for students . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are both very important for students . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concept derive often form facts and facts are always influenced and produced by ideas , so I think these two elements are closed correlated . <\s>
<s> For example , students can learn a lot by studing history , which is a complex mix of facts , ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> They should learn what happened in the past , the facts , the wars , the movings of people , but they should also know why these facts happened and possibly try to connect causes and effects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you just learn abstract concepts and ideas it is not easy to put them in the concrete life . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concept have their origin in facts that have happened . <\s>
<s> So it would be insufficient to learn them and not to learn the facts that originated them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For the same reason I think it is very important to learn the fatct together with concept and ideas that help to understan why facts happened . <\s>
<s> I think that if you sudy just a list of facts without to try to find the reasons and the consequences of these facts you can understand properly the importance of facts you study . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that also in scientific fields facts and ideas should be learnt together . <\s>
<s> If students learn just theory they miss the real importance of ideas and findings . <\s>
<s> They should understand what the ideas and concepts they study mean in the practice , how they can be used and have already been used . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I think it is very important to consider both points and that students should learn ideas , concepts and fact together <\s>
<s> Recently , we often see various adverisments on the TV and boad in the cities . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that most advertisments makes products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , advertisments can attracts us more than the procuts really are because the advertisments highlights the good points which the products have . <\s>
<s> Most products have several charactoristics both good points and bad points . <\s>
<s> In the advetisments , producer want to explain that the advantages , convinient usage , good appearance and so on . <\s>
<s> Especially in the small miniutes of advertisment on TV , they can explain only good points of products . <\s>
<s> Also , in small piece of paper advertisments such as flyers , they can also expalin the merit to buy the products more . <\s>
<s> Additionly , we rarely see the disadvantageis of the products in the advertisments . <\s>
<s> As a result , we can understand the only part of products . <\s>
<s> So we can not understand the product fully . <\s>
<s> This is likely to cause the products more attractive and we recognize the products as much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , advertisements force us to believe the products is better by keeping the adversitments in our mind for long time . <\s>
<s> When I turn on TV and walk around town , we often see advertisments many times daily . <\s>
<s> Then , I remenber the advertisments and the products . <\s>
<s> In the case that I go to the supermarket , I often select the products which is introduced at the adverisment of product because I know the product more than other producta which are less advertized . <\s>
<s> In this situation , even though the product I choose is not better than the others , I choose that I know well It . <\s>
<s> As a result , product which is often advertised is selected for me because I have a mind that I know well the product even though the product might not good . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In couclusion , I think that most adverisments makes products seem much better than they really are because the advertisements attract us by highlighting the good point of the products and are kept in mind long time . <\s>
<s> The best advertisements we see in television are usually made in a special way to make a product attractive to the public . <\s>
<s> A whole branch of marketing is based on the idea that a product must evoke something charming , something which will convince the receiver of the advertisement to buy the product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Usually , the best advertisements have the capacity to evoke a charming atmosphere , a pleasant concept , or a familiar situation . <\s>
<s> In order to explain my point better , I will give some examples of three main ways that advertisements use to make products better than they really are . <\s>
<s> For istance , the best way to advertise a perfume could to evoke the charming atmosphere of Paris by night . <\s>
<s> This atmopsphere does not explain characteristics of the product or . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , it is a very effective way to make an advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An example of a pleasant concept related to a product could be the concept of freedom related to a car . <\s>
<s> Usually the car convey the idea of freedom , of moving and this is another kind of effectve advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example of a way to make a product better that it is would be the strategy of a familiar situation . <\s>
<s> In a familiar situation is evoked . <\s>
<s> For istance a family eating breakfast would be a good way to introduce products as cookies or cereals . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All these examples provides situations while advertisments evokes certain atmospheres , concepts or situations attractive to the receivers . <\s>
<s> Recently , there are many kind of way to enjoy own life . <\s>
<s> And old peple become active in many situation . <\s>
<s> For example , they join dance lesson , volunteer , and part time job . <\s>
<s> But I think young people can enjoy living more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , young people have more power than old people . <\s>
<s> Young people have more confidence that they can do everything , and more challenging whatever we want to do than old peple . <\s>
<s> In my society , there are much young people who success their job , dream , project , and so on . <\s>
<s> And their face is full of satisfaction . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , young people have enough time to study new idea . <\s>
<s> They have to go to school , but it is very good for young people . <\s>
<s> In the school , teacher give a good and new sence to student . <\s>
<s> and school friends can share their opinion each other . <\s>
<s> It may have a good time for us to obtain or to get a new idea . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the most important advantage is that young people recognize that they have much time than old people . <\s>
<s> When I become older , I may think about my die . <\s>
<s> So , I want to prepare to die and I want to pass quiet until I die . <\s>
<s> But young people do n't have to think about it . <\s>
<s> They only think about how they make their life more enjoy . <\s>
<s> Someone hope that dream come true . <\s>
<s> Other one want to play more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think young people is more enjo <\s>
<s> Well in my opinion having broader knowledge in many academic subjects will be better than having monarchy in one subject . <\s>
<s> Man learns basically to earn his living . <\s>
<s> In this fast generation what subject gets boomed at what time cannot be expected . <\s>
<s> so if u learn a particular subject when it is in boom sometimes it also happens that while the time you learn the subject it looses its importance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Quoting an example Java was famous few years back but now the boom of SAP has come , in the same way knowledge of computer hard ware was not learnt by many but now people attend special classes to learn computer hardware . <\s>
<s> The growing competition is demanding them to learn hardware along with software . <\s>
<s> Another example which implies to my opinion is a person who is learning dance . <\s>
<s> It would be difficult to him to just dance without any minimal knowledge of music . <\s>
<s> His learning will be incomplete . <\s>
<s> In the same way the basic acense of learning is to gain complete knowledge . <\s>
<s> Having knowledge of one subject cannot fullfill the requirement of complete knowledge . <\s>
<s> Even though a person is called `` Jack of all trades '' when he or she tries to gain knowledge in many subjects the fast growing world which is hungry for many more new inventions to come is demanding him to be `` The jack of all trades '' . <\s>
<s> With such talent only one can survive this world of highly competitive nature . <\s>
<s> Also when we learn different subjects a person can relate them and this can help him at the time when he gets interested in research or this knowledge itself can drive him to relate and make new inventions . <\s>
<s> Having one subject can also make us feel bored . <\s>
<s> Having knowldge in one subject will be like eating bread only for the entire life . <\s>
<s> This sounds difficult ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence I conclude that having knowledge in all subjects would be a better choice than to get specalization in one subject . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in so many ways . <\s>
<s> I want to give some of the examples why i agree with this statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason that i agree young people enjoy life more than older people is because young people have lot of energy than older people . <\s>
<s> For enjoying life it is not suffient having money , enregy also require a lot . <\s>
<s> For example travelling different countries gives so much of enjoy to us . <\s>
<s> For travelling different countries money will not sufficient , lot of energy also required . <\s>
<s> But in older people they have less energy and they cannot travel such long journies . <\s>
<s> In this way young people have more advantages to the older people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason that i agree young people enjoy life more than older people is that younger people can get lot of entertainment in so many ways which older people cannot enjoy . <\s>
<s> For example going to the discos and watching late night movies and playing games . <\s>
<s> But the older people are not intersted in watching late night movies , going to discos and playing games . <\s>
<s> This is the other way that older people miss alot . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , some young people are enjoying life by concentrating on his job or any bussines work . <\s>
<s> some people are enjoying life by developing their companys and bussines development . <\s>
<s> Inorder to develop their growth for their work , so much of concentation , patience could require . <\s>
<s> The advantages for young people is they can produce lot of concentration , patience . <\s>
<s> But in older people , they have very less patience and they cannot concentrate for long time . <\s>
<s> In this way also young people are more advantage than older people to enjoy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , for all the above reasons i have mentoined , i want to say that i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in many ways , however i mentoined some of these advantages to younger people for enjoying life . <\s>
<s> `` The ideas and concepts are based on the individual one . <\s>
<s> No one can force to the other to follow her/his ideas . '' <\s>
<s> - it is well known adage . <\s>
<s> According to the statement it is important to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts . <\s>
<s> I would also agree with this statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From my point of view it is very impotant to be a successfull person to understand clearfully about the concepts and ideas wheteher in whichever field she/he is . <\s>
<s> We can take the example of the mathematics to support my thought . <\s>
<s> In mathematics we see that , its just depend on the concepts . <\s>
<s> If you have the concepts you can easily understood what the mathematics is all about . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of theorems in it which are just derive from the concepts . <\s>
<s> When the concepts of it are not clear to the student then he/she says oh my god how difficult it is . <\s>
<s> Without knowing that how wonderful subject it is . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second example for supporting my ideas is Computer languages . <\s>
<s> The computer language is beautiful combination of the ideas and the concepts . <\s>
<s> What you think is in the language bust conceptually structured . <\s>
<s> Just take the example of Visual Basic language how nice and pliable language is this . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If a student just follow the facts without noticing the concepts and ideas then it would be difficult to him to understand many problems of day - to-day life . <\s>
<s> Since day-to-day life is based indirectly on the mathematics and which is total depend on the concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Since facts ca n't be changed so they are not flexible as the concepts and ideas are . <\s>
<s> The student ca n't be a poetic one if he just depend on the facts since for the poetry the idea is very essential factor . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So facts are necessary but with ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Because with ideas and concepts the student can get profound knowledge about the subject . <\s>
<s> Concepts are fit directly into the mind without any confusion . <\s>
<s> And this will help a student to achieve the goal and fulfill his dreams . <\s>
<s> I do not agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer usage of cars than there are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I dont agree with this because , firstly , when the technology is increasing there will be more cars in use than they are today . <\s>
<s> with the increasing technology we can have cars which seem same as being in our home . <\s>
<s> now-a-days we are getting formula1 cars which are the fastest cars in the world . <\s>
<s> as the saying goes `` increase in technology will increase the world in many ways '' .cars are also in the same way , with the increase in technology the technology of cars will also be increased rather than becoming fewer in coming years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , now-a-days each and every person is prefering to have a car because it is a best as well as convinient way to go in a car rather than going in buses and trains . <\s>
<s> because they may consume a lot of time waiting for all the people who are travelling at that time to come . <\s>
<s> but when this is compared to cars we dont need to wait because we have our own car to travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , as petroleum is decreasing day-by-day , we may say that cars will become fewer in use than they are today , but technology is now inventing cars which run by gases for example , gases which we use for cooking etc , . <\s>
<s> by this we can say that cars can also be run without petroleum and can be run with gases either . <\s>
<s> so this will also not affect for cars becoming fewer in the upcoming years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So i conclude by saying that cars will not become fewer in use than they are today with the above stated reasons . <\s>
<s> the usage of cars will increase rather than decrease in the coming years . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From the simple obversation , young people have more activites in their everyday life than the older people . <\s>
<s> They go out for travels , go sporting , or dancing , and so on . <\s>
<s> They seem enjoy life more than the older people . <\s>
<s> But it is superficial . <\s>
<s> We ca n't get the conclustion just from the more activites they take . <\s>
<s> Whether it is enjoying life or not depends on the quality , motivation , emotion of entertaiments and other deep factors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The motivations and quality of activities differ between the young people and the older people . <\s>
<s> This leads to the fact that the older people more enjoy life than the young people when doing entertainments . <\s>
<s> The older people usually have more spare time than young people . <\s>
<s> Therefore , when they do their actitives , they really enjoy their times . <\s>
<s> But for young people , a lot of pressures always make their activites rush or pushy . <\s>
<s> Most of time , the activities of young people just help them release and relax a little bit , because they will put themselves into tougher situations later or they just are exausted from a very tough time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The deeper factors affecting the conclusion come from social and psycholigical side . <\s>
<s> The society usually gives more expectations to young people . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the young people are still in the developing period . <\s>
<s> Thus , there are many uncertainties enfronted by the young people . <\s>
<s> They need to develop themselves , recognize the society , and adjust themselves into the world . <\s>
<s> Therefore , for the young people , chanllenges and unstability are good for them but they really bring many difficulities or obstacles for them , including physically and mentally . <\s>
<s> It is really hard to say thta they enjoy their lifes while facing so many problems . <\s>
<s> But for the older people , they have already experience most of their lifes . <\s>
<s> They are more calm , and stable . <\s>
<s> So , they are more enjoying their current time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In sum , young people do n't enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> We live in a rapidly evolving world , so we can hardly predict the changes that will occur in the future . <\s>
<s> The tecnologycal progress , in particular , modifies any aspect of daily life ( instruction , communication , transport , etc . ) . <\s>
<s> At the same time , progress involves serious and unpredictable problems , such as pollution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people belive that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> According to them , the rapid development of alternative kinds of transport will risult in a progressive decreasement of the use of car . <\s>
<s> Faster , cheaper and more advanced machines will replace cars . <\s>
<s> On the one hand , sophisticated airplanes and high-speed trains will provide a good alternative to car for a long journey . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , efficient public transport should replace cars in the cities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , these prediction are quite excessive . <\s>
<s> First of all , the entity of economic interests involved in the car market is too relevant to desappear in a few years . <\s>
<s> In addition , even in relatively developed countries , such as Italy or Portugal , the public transport system is still obsolete and not efficient , and it could hardly replace cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , although cars will remain an essential part of our daily life , it will be necessary to modify radically their production tecnology , in order to face the problem of pollution . <\s>
<s> The more cars will be used , the more they will be echological . <\s>
<s> At present , I donate some money to the Foundation of Bill Gates as a sponsor to be able to help AIDS patients who have suffered in the South Africa . <\s>
<s> As we know , Bill Gates who is a founder in the company of Microsoft established to AIDS foundation to spend an enormous money for the AIDS patients and support them to get a better life by the appropriate treatment . <\s>
<s> He is already one of the billionares in the world with a fame . <\s>
<s> However , he is turning to others ' lives to help them without personal greed and seeking only prestiges . <\s>
<s> He has already got almost all things whatever he really want to achieve . <\s>
<s> However , he is not satisfied with these materialism , he is trying to turn the poor and suffering people with AIDS to share his wealth . <\s>
<s> I think he is the most powerful , respectful and admirable person in the world because he has a good personality to take care of others such as AIDS patients not just instead of caring for his business and his purpose . <\s>
<s> If he is doing very well in his own business like Microsoft company , people would not say he is being success or prominent person . <\s>
<s> Many people who are aroun me , they are successful and outstanding in their field such as lawyers , doctors , and bussinessmen . <\s>
<s> However , they all are trying to do new things without staying convenient situation . <\s>
<s> They try to help people who have suffered with various diseases as a free doctor and to act as a probono lawyer for the disabled . <\s>
<s> There are so many successful people in the world , most of them are usually doing decent something for others b <\s>
<s> I will be agree with the specify points . <\s>
<s> As i know student graps the ideas and concepts very faster by interactive learning then exposed to the facts . <\s>
<s> As i think the experience with the concepts make him to understand it clearly , while facts are the written statement which often makes the student obcure or uncear with basic ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> i will like to put forward some reasons to clear the view . <\s>
<s> understanding the ideas and the concept behind the idea by the experiece of the student make him alert in future when he exposed to the same situation . <\s>
<s> while ideas and concepts can be made clear by demonstration such as visual effects or audio effects . <\s>
<s> one of the example i will like to make , if a person is prone to car parts such as cluch , break , accelarator , engine and given a demonstration over it . <\s>
<s> He will be confident about to drive it and will make him drive smoothly . <\s>
<s> And this basic idea or concept he will never forgot if any difficult situation arise in furture regard car . <\s>
<s> For some if the undestand the concept very counsiously they might tackel the difficult situation uncounsiously also as they are previously prone to it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> while the facts are the given statement which are not explanatory , which leaves a negative or positive remark over a person . <\s>
<s> Infact he might be not clear of the facts given . <\s>
<s> which leads to mislead and aslo loose of some confident over it . <\s>
<s> Example over it is , a given satement of fact about the car parts over break , cluch , accelarator or engine will not make him or put him in to reliability to drive a car whiout given demonstration of it . <\s>
<s> And their is chances of misleading or damaging a car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus for the students who are learning much of new things should required a basic concept very clear so they can easily and confiently approach the test and also get higher grades . <\s>
<s> while if students are been told to refer the library or other materials for the test without giving a explanatory lecture over topic may often confuse them and result will not be expectory . <\s>
<s> Thus undestanding the ideas and the concept behind ideas will leave student confidentially to approach . <\s>
<s> It is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> My reason is memorazing a bunch of facts about a topic will not able to indentify and clearly understand the concept of the subject would be awful for the student . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand only learning the facts about the subject the student only know about the coclusions . <\s>
<s> They always spend their times for memorazing the informations because of this many important hour for human life spend for nothing . <\s>
<s> The most important thing is understand the idea and the concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my hometown , many of high schools ' students have to pass an exam which is called OSS which is for apply the university . <\s>
<s> The stundent responsibles of the four yerars high school educations . <\s>
<s> The problem is you have to memorize lot of facts and details about the questions . <\s>
<s> The details which she or he will forget after some decades days later . <\s>
<s> This situation shows that facts of students take the exam and they spend a lot of moneys and hour for nothing it was onlly about the pass the exam and a result of this preparation courses do not give a chence improve the your knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion the students must be aducated in a traning which enables them to use their potentioanl about the subject . <\s>
<s> This kid of work gives a chance them to understand the ideas and concepts of work . <\s>
<s> In addition to this in an effective learning sytems for example learning with activities , diagrams , and traning useful for the students . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The students could choose their courses to understand the ideas of the subjects and concets , because if the student wants to study abour for his or her master learniong facts doesnt help him or her . <\s>
<s> Here the topic is about , is it more important to the students to understand ideas and conceots than it is for them to learn the facts . <\s>
<s> I strongly agree with the point of understanding the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every student should have the concept and understand the ideas rather than learning the facts about that . <\s>
<s> By lerning the concept the student can understand the subject very well and can be easy with that subject . <\s>
<s> If we understand the ideas of the subject the student can proceed with the subject very well , and go deeper into the subject of which he is understanding . <\s>
<s> For example if we take the mathematics we need to have concept in the maths than the facts regarding that , the ideas are more important in mathematics than the facts . <\s>
<s> If we have the facts knowing about the mathematics then the real concept is not concentrated . <\s>
<s> Because in mathematics practice is more important than knowing the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The student who is concerned about the facts it is of no use , because if he concentrated on facts he cannot be in the competitive world , as the oter students are going fast by knowing the concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> If you take a class room in which a student is intrested in knowing the facts rather than the concept and the ideas then he will certainly loosing something which other students are gaining , being a conceptual and knowing the ideas is the encoureged way then knowing the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At last i state that be a conceptual person and understand the ideas rather than to be knowing the facts . <\s>
<s> understanding the ideas will not featch a lot in the student life <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement , and feel that only a hand full of people spend enough time for helping their communities . <\s>
<s> The following are few of the resons why i agree . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , the young people are so much inclined towards their job and shaping their carrier and looking for leading a luxurious life , that they hardly get any time for helping their communities . <\s>
<s> They have time to go to the pubs and hanging around with their friends but hardly any of them spends time for their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Recently , i approached a friend of mine to accompany me to an old aged community , that runs for the old people who have been abandoned by their children , only to give some food to them that my mother had prepared . <\s>
<s> But he began to give all lame excuses that he has to go out along with his parent 's . <\s>
<s> Later i found out that he was at home the whole day . <\s>
<s> He did not even think that by doing so how happy will they feel . <\s>
<s> Also helping their communities implies that the person has some humanity feeling in him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , the young people in their teens are so much so influenced by their friends and other activities that at a point they even do not behave properly with their own parent 's . <\s>
<s> For them , their friends are their everything . <\s>
<s> Such people hardly spend any time helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Looking at this rate the young people , must realise that after some age even they will not be young and also they will be in need of young people for help . <\s>
<s> Atleast , having this in mind they must spend time for helping . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The above reasons makes me feel so , In order to overcome this , the young people , especially the student 's must make it a routine to spend some time , not much , but atleast half an hour per day for helping the communities . <\s>
<s> Being a member of the young people myself , I agree with the idea that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> It is sad that I have to admit it , but this word sounds unfamiliar to me , and I must imagine something that the older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It seems to me that young people are not even caring about the community , or do not think about themselves belonging to it . <\s>
<s> I often hear that the connection between neighbors are very weak in Japan , and I agree with that as I see many people not even exchanging greetings when they see a neighbor around their houses . <\s>
<s> I live in an apartment , and sometimes see young people like me , but they do not try to greet me from them , so I always speak out first . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think this connection between people has something to do with young people not helping their community so much . <\s>
<s> For example , whenever there is an event held by the apartment that I live , the people who take part in it are small kids and their family , and then the old people . <\s>
<s> The middle-aged people organizes the event . <\s>
<s> Young people could also take part in these events , but they , or we , tend to spend time on other things for our own fun . <\s>
<s> If we become more interested in the community , I am sure we could affect the community in a good way that can make the community more active . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I also think there is a problem or a point that can be improved in the community itself in order to get young people more interested in the it . <\s>
<s> Perhaps some young people think that they want to help the community in some way , but they do not know how , and think of it as something not easy to access to . <\s>
<s> If the community can make an atmosphere that the young people can feel comfortable , maybe they would show interest . <\s>
<s> In addition , I think the older generations should tell the younger ones what the community is , and how they could help in order to make followers of their work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I want to start from paying more attention to the comminity and then help in some way . <\s>
<s> For me , I would agree to join a group that led by a tour guide ; however , to travel by ourselves in an unknown plave in very dangerous and will spend lots of money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let 's imagine a condition . <\s>
<s> If we travel to an unknown place with only a map and confused by it , will we have a lot of fun in that place ? <\s>
<s> I think everyone 's answer is no . <\s>
<s> We can not just visit an unknown place on foot ; we should drive a car . <\s>
<s> If we miss the direction , we have to keep driving and spend lots of money for the oil . <\s>
<s> Without the help of the tour guide , we might live in an expensive hotel . <\s>
<s> If there is something we do not understand about the landscapes , there is no one we can ask , and it is not easy to ask a stranger . <\s>
<s> Once we meet the dangers such as medical care , it will be very hard to seek the volunteers who can help us . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If there is a tour guide , we can visit the place , which in the place we do not even know before , with happy heart and good consulors . <\s>
<s> We do not need to bring a map becuase the tour guide is our map . <\s>
<s> We do not need to walk or drive the car and spend the oil money ; we will have a comfortable bus and pay only a small amout of money for it . <\s>
<s> We will not have any questions about the landscapes becuase the tour guide will be a teacher . <\s>
<s> If we have dangers , the tour guide will find a way as soon as possible to solve it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , even though travel just by ourselves can make us have more freedom and time , but we will also bring anything that is uncertain with us , such as car accidents and miss the way to go . <\s>
<s> We all sure want the happiness and peace with us when we are traveling , but without a good helper , everything will happen easily . <\s>
<s> If there is a good helper when we are traveling , we do not need to worry much about everything becuase the tour guide can led us to the happiness and peace . <\s>
<s> Although we have to pay the money to the tour guide , but the most important is the safety and a nice spirit in a trip . <\s>
<s> I disagree that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> There are many reasons to explain my opinion of disagreement that the most advertisemnet make products seem much better than the really one . <\s>
<s> one reason is users and the other reason is showing the products to people . <\s>
<s> As we know the advertisement is used to show the product to the people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason is users . <\s>
<s> as we know that the users are the most important part of many companies . <\s>
<s> Most of the companies in the world work to find a good way to keep people or user to buy the products by advertisement and they try to provide good products every year . <\s>
<s> For example , if I have a company , I will provide good products to the people , and I will advertise my products in good way as it is . <\s>
<s> The advertisement will show my products to more and more people . <\s>
<s> So , most advertisement make products seem the real one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other reason is that the advertisement is used to show the products as it is without adding anything that makes the production seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> In addition , the advertisement is good way for people to have good products in homes . <\s>
<s> Fore example , the advertisement will show the advantage and disadvantage of the product . <\s>
<s> If it has disadvantage , the advertisement will show its disadvantage , because if the advertisement does not show the advantage and disadvantage , the company that makes the advertisement will lose its users and people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally , I disagree that the most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> the above two reasons explains my opinion about advertisement . <\s>
<s> Users are imprtants for the many companies and the advertisement is used to show the products to people . <\s>
<s> In our society , education is a main issue . <\s>
<s> On the one hand , people think that the education should promote a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , people think that society needs more specialists . <\s>
<s> However I believe that we should specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One reason for my belief is that we are all generalist . <\s>
<s> We have all a knowledge on everything . <\s>
<s> This knowledge is more or less accurate , it depends on the person . <\s>
<s> For example , when I have an headache , I never go to the doctor , I only take an aspirin . <\s>
<s> I have a whole knowledge on medicine care . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason for my belief is that the society needs to increase its knowledge . <\s>
<s> Specialist are the only people who are able to entertain to the development of the society . <\s>
<s> Others copy what they have learn form the specialist . <\s>
<s> For instance when I am ill I need the doctor , for his advice . <\s>
<s> But after , when I have the same ill I just need to take the medicine drug . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , specialist are the actors of the development of the society . <\s>
<s> With their sharp knowledge in only one field , they are the only people who are at the border between what has been discovered and what has not yet been discovered , in this field . <\s>
<s> To illustrate a researcher in developement of a product for a firm . <\s>
<s> He has no concrete idea of what he will create because there are nothing similar uim society . <\s>
<s> But he is sure that is new product had never exist before . <\s>
<s> This product represent a new thing to add in the human culture . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Society have a lot of generalist , but few specialist . <\s>
<s> Because society needs more specialist and because I prefer to be useful for the society , I would rather to be a specialist . <\s>
<s> Who does n't know advertisements for for sporting articles , like NIKE or Adidas or for cars , like the new Mercedes or simply for foods , like milk ? <\s>
<s> In these advertisements the products are looking always good or are n't they ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So the question what I want to discuss now is , if the advertisements make products seem much better , than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the one hand I think that the products that are advertised are very , very bad , because it is often shown only the whole article and in most of the cases never the details . <\s>
<s> You only have to look at the case of food , because there are often pesticides found , when this food gets tested in labors . <\s>
<s> I think everybody can remember the chocolate chaos at the big supermarket Hofer in Austria . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also the advertisement of cars looks always superb , but in reality there are so many failures , as I have seen on the car of my father . <\s>
<s> With this car we always had problems , because the electric was not well working . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result of these failures there will also be danger for humans be affected , from the bad technic , as well as from the underaverage bad food . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But on the other hand I think , that the products , which are shown in an advertisement are really as good as they seem , because behind this products it is very often a lot of innovation . <\s>
<s> Who does n't know the NIKE Air System in shoes ? <\s>
<s> It was a simple development in the past , but today still works , because the people know , that this is as good as in the advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover I think , that products , which have been tested for long terms by the companies , will increase more and more on quality and finally it is possible to itentify this product with the advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion I would say , that neot everybody should look only at the advertisements . <\s>
<s> In general , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts . <\s>
<s> However , I am not convinced that it is not neccessary to learn facts also . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On one hand , it is very important for students to understand the basic idea of different phenomenon . <\s>
<s> With this it will be much easier to learn new things and solve problems much more effective . <\s>
<s> The needed facts one can review later in a lot of books . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , for solving a problem one will need always a lot of facts and while working in a company , one will be always under time pressure . <\s>
<s> Therefore an employee with a lack of already known solutions , will need much more time for solving a given problem , while spending time in reading books . <\s>
<s> Moreover it is possible that he will find an already known answer for the task . <\s>
<s> For example , when one have to invent something new , the first point is always a patent research . <\s>
<s> Mostly one will find a already known proper solution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a scientific assistent at the faculty of mechanical engineering I met many times problems while researching on a specific topic . <\s>
<s> My experiences are , that in 98 percent I can solve these problems only with the actual state of the art and only in 2 percent I need to invent something new . <\s>
<s> Moreover I wrote a lot of exams in which I had known all basics , but , I was not able to calculate a giving machine , as I had not known specific facts . <\s>
<s> According to this , I am advising the students in my classes of thermodynamic to have an careful look to the different processes given as an example in the book . <\s>
<s> When they will write the examen at the end of the semesters , it is possible that one of this processes have to been calculated . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I think that it is better for undergraduate students to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> What is more , it is better for graduate students to specialize in one specific subjuect . <\s>
<s> My reasons are lised as follows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the first place , the majoritey of undergraduate students face the problom of finding jobs when they graduate from the university or college , except the students who plan to pursue the higher degree . <\s>
<s> If they have broad knowledge of many academic , it means that they have more oppotunitise to recieve a good job . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , it is obvious that undergraduate students just recieve a fundational education in the university . <\s>
<s> With the broad knowledge background , the undergraduate students will become move competitive in the job market . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As far as the graduate students , Since their tasks is be outstanding in one special field , and they have not enough energy to study deeply in various fields . <\s>
<s> Therefore , it is suitable for a graduate students to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , I always believe that a graduate student is a person who is so intellegent that can contribute to the field of science which he or she is studing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ademittedly , having broad knowledge of various academic subjects is definitely benefacial for graduate students to achieve success in his special field . <\s>
<s> As a result , it is greatly useful for everyone to devote himself of herself to enlarge the sphere of knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Taking into account of what have been discussed above , we may reach the conclusion that the undergraduate students should have broad knowledge of many academic , and the graduate students are more suitable to study in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Travelling should be fun and variable experience in my life . <\s>
<s> In order to satisfied with traveling , I disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , if I have to travel with a tour guide , I have to be controlled by the itnerary that is made by the travel agency . <\s>
<s> For example , I have to keep moving on followed by a tour guide although I would rather to stay in a museum . <\s>
<s> It is better to make my own schedule to see everhing I want based on my own lists . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , if I cam explore by myself , it is bigger chance to get some unexpected experience such as seeing famous people there , or getting paticular foods in the area . <\s>
<s> Exploring or challenging to do something in overseas or even outside of town is a part of fun . <\s>
<s> I like doing some special activities if I have a chance . <\s>
<s> Basically , those activities are not provided by the tour agency . <\s>
<s> To excute this plan , I need to ask people who live there , and I need to try it . <\s>
<s> Thinking about these plan makes me excited , I will do that activity for sure if I have a chance , I like challenging <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , traveling needs money . <\s>
<s> In order to spend money efficieny , it is good to travel without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> If I am with a tour guide , I might need to pay for somthing which I am not willing to spend . <\s>
<s> Insted of using money for that a tour gide suggests , I can use money for other things such as making another trip from the area . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , to travel without a tour guide is good for saving time and money , also , to enjoy some rare experience . <\s>
<s> In order to make the trip better , it is better to traval by my own plan without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> i agree . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> History has teach us that successful people take risks . <\s>
<s> When people take risks they take the dificult path . <\s>
<s> A more complex and difficult path its in front of them . <\s>
<s> They are in front of the unknow . <\s>
<s> The unknow its a very difficult path becuase people do not know what its going to hit them next . <\s>
<s> Important is when the people accomplish the unknow and make a use of it , they become a successful man . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I want to become a successful man , and for that reason i need to take risks . <\s>
<s> The risks that im going to take is to go away to a different country and study there . <\s>
<s> A new world with out my famiy is going to shape my soul . <\s>
<s> Im going to learn new things and take new risks . <\s>
<s> I am trying to become a better man . <\s>
<s> I am trying to become a better person , and that is success for me . <\s>
<s> In the path of success there are many unknow traps . <\s>
<s> I have to learn from the traps and use them in my future life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I could stay in my house and do what i do well . <\s>
<s> I know i can be a successful man doing what i know already WELL . <\s>
<s> But i ca n't stay home and not try to accomplish my dreams . <\s>
<s> I feel a successful person has to accomplish treir dreams and take new risks . <\s>
<s> This is the second time i take the toefl exam . <\s>
<s> I need 90 points and i got 89 . <\s>
<s> do you thing im going to stop there . <\s>
<s> No , i need to take risks and do the exam again and again until i pass . <\s>
<s> A successful person is someone who acomplish what ever they are looking for . <\s>
<s> When you want to accomplish something you have to take risks and do not stop ; you have to try new things and do not stop until you accomplish your dreams . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> my dreams is to study in Sydney and im not going to stop taking risks until i accomplish that . <\s>
<s> becouse that mekes me a successful man . <\s>
<s> That is what successful people try new things . <\s>
<s> i believe people have only one life and they have to take the best out of it . <\s>
<s> For that reason there is a need of every successful man to take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thank you , <\s>

<s> If we think about the statement , that `` It is better to have broad knowlegde of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific sucject '' , we can make a lot of comment on it . <\s>
<s> Because everyone have different ability to answer any question or make comment on any question . <\s>
<s> In this essay , the specific subject , that is stated before , is critisized and compared and contrasted . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , in my opinion , half of people living in the world may choose different one of the choises in the statement from rest of them . <\s>
<s> if I say something about that topic , I say that of course everyone should specialize in one spesific subject , that is beneficial for humanity , but he or she also have a little knowledge of everything , because nowadays human population is developing increasingly . <\s>
<s> So technology is . <\s>
<s> As the matter can be seen , specializing in one specific subject does n't enough for working somewhere you want . <\s>
<s> Bosses are searching for man who can do every job that necessery for the firm . <\s>
<s> For example , if you are a computer engineer , you must know management because in the future you will be a manager , There is no reason not to be maanager , because nobody wants to die as retired engieneer . <\s>
<s> Most people want more than they have . <\s>
<s> In order to that , besides you specialize in one specific subject , you should know another academic subject as a hobby . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , people who did n't choose specializing in one specific subject , are always loser , because there is n't any job anywhere . <\s>
<s> The cruel world makes us to study whole day . <\s>
<s> We must study English to pass prep class or must study buisiness administration to finish the school or must increas us culture to become more social , etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However I choose the second one , I suppose that the right one is the first choices to become more successful . <\s>
<s> To sum up everyone should make his own decision about that subject to becaome successful and happy , <\s>
<s> I agree with this statment because in the future less people will obtain cars due to the advanced technology in the mechanical feild which might produce new inventions that might be easier to use , safer for the enviroment , has a lesser consumption of fossil fuel and doesnt cause traffic jams which is a major problem faced by our community today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars now adays are a major head ache to the people who live in developed cities due to the traffic jam caused by them . <\s>
<s> This started making some scientists to think of macking hay while the sun shines by building flying cars which could have special air tracks and traffic signals which will stop the traffic jam . <\s>
<s> Ofcourse they are still working on the project trying to minimize as possible the cars price to offer opportunities to major people to buy this kind of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many goverments started thinking of building under grount trains that also will fasilitate the decrease in traffic jam and at the same time provide convinience to the people who use them as thy will make them reach to their wanted place in a lesser time due to their high speed and it makes them also save a lots of money as they dont have to pay for petrol or cars maintanence . <\s>
<s> Not to mention that the trains tickets pice will be very low . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other goverments like in china enhance the people living their to use bycicles to go all around the city by macking special tracks and signals only for bycicle users not to mention the secial parking rods that are placed in front of each building to make it much more esier for the people over there to park their bycicles safely and head on to their jobs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion the use of cars in the future will be alot lesser than now adays with the help of our goverments and scientists who are really working hard to give out their best to reach our comfort . <\s>
<s> There are many new things surrounding us and waiting for us to take an adverture on them . <\s>
<s> Sometimes when I switched on the television , there are some programmes concerning about how do people success , or which ways they are going in order to become a successful person . <\s>
<s> I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> On the following paragraphs , I will explain the reasons for that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , if you do not take any risks , you will not know what it will be after you have tried it . <\s>
<s> Though you may fail , you will gain some experience on that . <\s>
<s> For example , some successful people are very poor and do not have enough money to deal with business . <\s>
<s> But they still tried to use that small amount of money in a useful way . <\s>
<s> Though you have to bear a high risk , it is wealthy for you to do that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , accept others opinions . <\s>
<s> Sometimes we think that we already know how to deal with all the things and we just follow our own way to go , but actually we are not . <\s>
<s> We should accept more suggestions from the others and try to think over all the things that they mentioned but do not think I can do this well with just a little experience on that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , they always try new things and treat themselves as a new entrant . <\s>
<s> As a new entrant , you will eager to know more things and learn more from the others rather than become a senior on certain things . <\s>
<s> You may try new things and see whether you can handle this problem or not . <\s>
<s> There are so many stuff that you have never been encoutered before . <\s>
<s> And always trust and build up confident to yourself that you can do that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people think that they can do well according to their `` limited '' knowledge . <\s>
<s> They never try to explore some useful and helpful information to help them . <\s>
<s> That is why they cannot become a successful person and still walking in the same square . <\s>
<s> Therefore , take risks and try more new things can help you widen your sight and knowlege . <\s>
<s> At the same time , to become a successful person . <\s>
<s> Advertisements is a big part of the products in the manufacturing world . <\s>
<s> Many people will say that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Others will say that advertisements do n't make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Personally , I agree to this statement , that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , during the exciting day of the Super Bowl . <\s>
<s> Many companies fight over for a commercial spot for their product , which is usually alcohol beverages . <\s>
<s> These companies make these the most funniest , interesting , and catchy phrases for everyone to watch . <\s>
<s> Eventhough they are just regular everyday alcohol products . <\s>
<s> If the prospector sees the advertisement , many people will might get convinced to buy the product because they just make it better when you watch it with everyone during the Super Bowl . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A second example is advertisements for facial products , like make-up . <\s>
<s> Many women would want to have a efficient product of make-up for their face . <\s>
<s> The advertisements have pictures and small movie clips , showing how effective their manufacture are by Expressing that they are the best , than other advertisements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example is in a personal experience when there was a modeling contest in Japan . <\s>
<s> The production made advertisements that convinced people to join the contest because they offered many opportunities to the girls ; like money , magazines , and to be in a movie . <\s>
<s> These are some of the girls dreams , because of the advertisement for this contest more than 100,000 girls from the ages of tweelve to eighteen registered for this contest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisements are now a big part of the products , in the manufacturing world , because many people are convinced visually . <\s>
<s> Consequently , these are the reasons why I support the statement that most advertisements amke products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Today cars are considered very necessary for every travels we have to do during our life , but I strongly believe that the number of cars will decrease in twenty years for several reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason for the decrease of cars is that as the years go on the petrolium and consequently oil reserves will dramatically decrease and this will influence the cost of carburant , which will increase a lot , and so people will be not encouraged to buy a car knowing the fact that oil is so expensive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , there is also an ambiental reason that make me think that the number of cars will decrease , the fact that cars pollute air and so are a risk for our health : for this reason I think that governements will not encourage the bought of new cars by taxing them a lot . <\s>
<s> In addition to this , our cities are not only polluted but also full of cars which make moving in the city low : as a result of this situation I think that the mayors of the cities will not approve an increase in the number of cars in order to avoid that towns will get full and full of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I also think that in the future there will be a raise of different means of transport such as trains , bus , metro in order to decrease the pollution of the air , in fact it is demonstrated that trains and metro are more echological than cars ( and they are also more comfortable ) ; as a result of this increase of alternative means of transport the use of car will be destined to decrease since the majority of population will travel with trains or metro . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An example of this decrease of cars is provided by my own family , in fact I and my parents have decided not to buy a new car for my birthday because it costs a lot . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For all these reasons I think that the number of cars will decrease . <\s>
<s> I partially agree the idea and to travel in a group with a tour guide supposed to be one of the most efficient way to visit a place , especially when people go to the country where they never been so far . <\s>
<s> As for me , I usually travel with my friends and I have no experience to company with the person , such as a tour guide because I believe that there are following disadvantages to do it : I do not wast the time by visitting the place which I am not so interested in ; and I hope to have a look real aspects of the country or place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The people who participate in a gruop traveling must be varioused to age , interest or sex . <\s>
<s> To fulfill the satisfaction of every visitors , travel companies would take them many sorts of place regardless thinking about what or in where they actually would like to experience in the trip . <\s>
<s> The travel time is limited and at the same time I really want to make it fun , therfore I should go or do only what makes me have interest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Further , travel companies tend to emphasize only good aspects of the places to a travelor , in order not only to make them have a fond of memories there , but also to make them come back there . <\s>
<s> I am tired of seeing a place where most of tourists visit and having a meal which most of them have eaten . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Taken together , for the person who hopes to know the place where he or she visits deeply , like me , should have a coonection or freiend who dwell there for a long time and they diffinetely take he or she the restaurant or bar which tour group rarely visit . <\s>
<s> To my opinion young people appreciate life more than older people . <\s>
<s> The reason for this is towfold . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , young people are less aware of death than the older poeple . <\s>
<s> Usually young people are in good wealth . <\s>
<s> They do not think about their own death on a every day basis , exept in specific cases . <\s>
<s> There is no doubt that older people are more aware of their own death than youger people . <\s>
<s> Most of them have already been confronted to death . <\s>
<s> They may have loose close relatives : the husband or the wife for instance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not thinking about death too much is a way to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> As youg people fear less to die they can accomplish more things . <\s>
<s> Most of the young people do not fear to take risqs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The youth is the feeling that life is only at the beginning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , being young envolves that the person is able to have children and to build up a family . <\s>
<s> Having children is no doubt one of the most important joy of life . <\s>
<s> Nowadays a woman is able to have children until she is 40 years old . <\s>
<s> In today 's society being 40 years old is regarded as mid age but still young in a way . <\s>
<s> A child is like a sunshine in someone 's life . <\s>
<s> Seing your child growing is such a source of happyness . <\s>
<s> Only young people can enjoy this great experience . <\s>
<s> One may argue that being a grand parent is olso a wonderful experience but this experience is undoubtly different from the previous one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is commun place to hear old people talking about their past life with a nostalgic tone . <\s>
<s> After a certain age people tend to live in memories . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement , In my opinion it is better to be specialized in one subject field . <\s>
<s> In todays world where the economy is growing at an uncontrolable speed , every industry is no less than a global giant , every field is becoming a money minting arena , in such an environment is will be a gross mistake to have a broad knowledge . <\s>
<s> Specialization gives one an indepth of the subject . <\s>
<s> It gives one the chance to excel and give ones hundered percent to a specific field . <\s>
<s> It makes us clearly see our weaknesses and strenghts and helps us to evaluate ourselves and see where we really stand . <\s>
<s> Broad knowledge is like a half baked story where one is not exceling in any specific field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One can pick any field , art , business , music or even politics , everything requires the best peopleand those kind of empoyees who know their subject backwards . <\s>
<s> In such a senario one cannot take a chance by having a broad grip on all subjects . <\s>
<s> A situation such as this would only create doubt and ultimately a low pay or unemployment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is another alternative to this dillema and that is that alongside being specialized in any one field one can also have a hobby . <\s>
<s> For Example , a film star , She loves her news coverage , her fame , her glory , her fortune , but there are times when everyone wants to forget their work and find themselves by doing things that they enjoy . <\s>
<s> She can do social sevice or something small like pottery or photography at a hobby . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> ` If a bird spreads its wings beyond its reach , it will crash ' . <\s>
<s> Thus , according to me it is more sensible to choose one line of work and excel in it . <\s>
<s> But yes sometimes we must retrieve and pursue other samll activities as well . <\s>
<s> I completly agree with this statement because in all advertisement the product they show is the best of all , they show the product as if it is the 8 wonder of the world , but when you go to buy the product because you are completly facinated about it you notice that is n't even the half of what they said . <\s>
<s> This happens to all people in the world eventhouh all people know that what advertisements said are never correct they always want to go and buy the product and keep falling on buying the product they wanted . <\s>
<s> This statement should be place on every advertisement because sometimes that are really rare times the advertisement is correct and people think if they should buy it or just let it go because it may not be what they saw . <\s>
<s> This creat loses in some companies because they now need to show the people that what they are selling its the real stuff . <\s>
<s> In some way what they are doing is cheating the costumers in every way because costumers go buy things , things that they think are correct but at the end they lose their money , the product and they ca n't do anything about it because they have already pay for it . <\s>
<s> The advertisements that really cheat costumers are the ones given on the web , things that you can buy on the web are most of the time not what the costumer wanted . <\s>
<s> But they are also things that you can buy on the web like programs because they will always be what they said the program has . <\s>
<s> In conclusion I think that companies that make this kind of advertisment are doin it just to get a profit of it but what they are really doing is makig their company fall because if they at the beginning starte to show advertisements that are n't real costumers wont buy any thing else from thta company even if after the company startes to amke good stuff . <\s>
<s> As my advice I think that companies should show the product as it is or make the product look exactly as they show in the advertisement <\s>
<s> Advertisement is crucial for the companies that are trying to have a place in the market . <\s>
<s> These firms aims to show their products , or advertise them in a way that will attract the potential buyers . <\s>
<s> However , in that competition they are exaggerating the advertisement - making the products seem much better - for the sake of the profit . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Within the the communication network ( i.e. media , internet ) around the world , the advertisements can reach up to many people . <\s>
<s> The person seeing a great advertisement of a product that he \ she is planning to buy can easily believe the correctness and the reliability of the product . <\s>
<s> However , it may not fulfill his \ her requirements . <\s>
<s> For example , my mother had seen an advertisement about a machine that could decrease your belly size 3-4 in a month with regular activities . <\s>
<s> It seemed so great that my mother just got the idea to be thinner by exercising with this machine . <\s>
<s> Even though it was quite expensive , she bought it . <\s>
<s> She had done exercises for a month , but later she realized no change so she put it in a trash . <\s>
<s> The point that I want to mention by giving this example is that a person can be really influenced by the advertisement that is shown so great that might enable the audience just believe it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a second example of the false advertesiment , one day I have seen a small show whose sponsor is Gilette . <\s>
<s> That TV-show is always emphasing how good Gilette razors are . <\s>
<s> They are showing a handsome man , shaving smoothly , 3 - razors , nothing left after one sweep etc . <\s>
<s> At that time , I was using a cheap razor for shaving and it was quite enough for me . <\s>
<s> However , I have decided to change my razor , I do n't know the reason but I just wanted to try this `` hilarious Gilette razor '' . <\s>
<s> I dont think that I should mention about what happened afterwards . <\s>
<s> It had nothing special . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Growing communication devices enables the advertisements to reach to many people . <\s>
<s> However , companies are making their best to make their products seem better in order to improve their income , profit . <\s>
<s> Today it is very difficult to invent new things or find new ways to be succesful . <\s>
<s> But what is the best way to be successful ? <\s>
<s> Should you take risks ? <\s>
<s> And for which persons it is easier to take risks ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion it is not easy for an unsuccessful person to take a risk . <\s>
<s> Becauso there must by any reasons because this person is unsuccessful . <\s>
<s> So perhaps an unsuccessful person already took some risks which were not successful . <\s>
<s> So they are in a kind afraid of taking new risks . <\s>
<s> If the new idea is wrong they will lost again . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And this is different at successful people . <\s>
<s> They have a lot of success and for them it is no problem to take risks . <\s>
<s> They are not afraid . <\s>
<s> If the risk was wrong there is a base under them and nearly nothing could happen to them . <\s>
<s> But one reason why successful people are successful is that they take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For this I will give an example . <\s>
<s> You have to imagine you are the CEO at a big company and at the moment the number one with your products in the world . <\s>
<s> But there are several smaller companies which are coming closer and closer . <\s>
<s> One day a customer want you to create a new product , but with your machines this is not possible to take the order . <\s>
<s> The customer sais that he will go to the other companies if you do not built or create the necessary machienes . <\s>
<s> Taking the order will cost a lot of money and the success is not sure . <\s>
<s> What would you do ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think it is much easier to take the order for a company with very much success . <\s>
<s> They know they can take risks because if the order will not be good it will not be all over . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is different for a CEO who 's company does not work right . <\s>
<s> On the one hand the company needs the order but on the other hand it is the end of the company if the order will not be successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that successful people always want more . <\s>
<s> So they do not think about as much as unsuccessful people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I think it is easier to take risks if you are a successful pearson . <\s>
<s> Even if I am not asked , I am sure that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> There are principal 3 reasons . <\s>
<s> In this essay , I will introduce them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , we must quit using our cars inevitably when we think about environment . <\s>
<s> Driving our cars links to increasing environmental problems . <\s>
<s> CO2 which cars exhaust rise up our planet 's temperature , kill out a lot of forests , and dirt air we breeze everyday . <\s>
<s> So , we have to cease driving cars rather than will do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , there wiil bo no more rooms where we can park cars in common . <\s>
<s> Today , we have a lot of buildings , amusement parks , and othere public facilities . <\s>
<s> There are few empty area in Japan . <\s>
<s> And this must be continuing forbthe future . <\s>
<s> Cars are big objects . <\s>
<s> We will use not the big one but small convenient object like bike or our feet . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , about ourselves ' health . <\s>
<s> Because cars are so fast and confortable , we often use cars . <\s>
<s> When we drive cars , what only we use is arms . <\s>
<s> We hardly use our legs . <\s>
<s> This is unordinal for human . <\s>
<s> we must use our own bodies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From these reason , I am sure that there will be ferer <\s>
<s> Some people are called successful people because they try for something that others cannot achieve so easily . <\s>
<s> Because of these successful persons we are able to see refrigerator , micro owen , television , computer , aeroplane etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people are unique and risques are always part of thier life . <\s>
<s> They never mind taking risks during reaching thier goal . <\s>
<s> For example take the case of wright brother of America who has led to the discovery of jet plane , aeroplane . <\s>
<s> Wright brothers saw a bird flying in the air and he thought that why cannot a similar structure be made and make it fly in the air using two wings and a tail . <\s>
<s> He went to ahill and ran from the hill to downwards by letting to fly with the modelled plane . <\s>
<s> He had tried several times and has eventually failed . <\s>
<s> Even there was risk to his life he never minded and his goal was to run the plane . <\s>
<s> Atlast he finally succeded oneday . <\s>
<s> From this one can learn successful people try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can also take the case of Newton who was responsible to find the gravity of motion of earth . <\s>
<s> He was once sitting down an apple tree and he was seeing up towards the sky . <\s>
<s> While he was seeing towards the sky an apple has eventually had fallen on his head . <\s>
<s> He was surprised by seeing the apple that had fallen on his head and he thought that why does the apple does not go up towards the sky and why is it falling downwards . <\s>
<s> This typical thinking lead him to the finding of gravitational motion of earth . <\s>
<s> He was also responsible for finding the three Newtons law of motion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From the above examples we can conclude that successful people always try new things and those things make these people unique from others . <\s>
<s> Without risk we cannot do any thing great and we all people should do something new and find something new and contribute something to world . <\s>
<s> We can see many successful people is word such as BILL GHATES and EINSTINE . <\s>
<s> BILL GHATES made a lot of money form creating a software called windows and EINSTINE made a great theory such as E = mc2 . <\s>
<s> Even the way they succes is different the common thing is that they gave there entire life to built it . <\s>
<s> In my opinion successful people doesn ; t try new thing but try to develope the thing they can do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> BILL GHATES met his first computer when he was 14 years old . <\s>
<s> At that time there was two famous company called MACANTOSHI & APPLE ( well later they united though ) . <\s>
<s> He tried to learn computer because if was very interesting . <\s>
<s> later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself . <\s>
<s> This kind of result was able because he constantly developed his talent . <\s>
<s> In my opinion for succesing finding and challenging a new way is also important but constantly trying is also important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> EINSTINE is also a succesful persone is physics . <\s>
<s> His new theory about black energy , black holes , times , lights and movement destroied newton and platon 's theory and made a new page is the history of physics . <\s>
<s> It is hard to believe that this huge theory was made by a single man . <\s>
<s> In my opinion that the reasone it was able is because he always thaught about physics . <\s>
<s> Many books and researches says that he thaught about physics 60 percent of his time . <\s>
<s> As you can see successful people developes there talents rather than finding a new way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude I think that successful people find there talent and develope what they already know how to do rather than finding a new thing to do . <\s>
<s> It is because no pains no gains . <\s>
<s> not trying any thing and seeking for chances to succeed can never make a good result . <\s>
<s> In Japan , where I live , there are many travelers around famous places such as Kyoto , Fukuoka , and Tokyo . <\s>
<s> As the way of trip , some people feel that travel in a group with a tour guide is the best way . <\s>
<s> However , in my opinion , I disagree that the best way is to travel in a group . <\s>
<s> I prefer to travel individually . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> More importantly , I can go to travel when I feel to want travel . <\s>
<s> If I plan to go somewhere , immediately I can go everywhere and everytime . <\s>
<s> However , if I go to travel in a group , it is necessary to arrange the time that members in a group can gather . <\s>
<s> For example , last sunday I went to hotspring alone in Okutama , which is famous for hotspring location in Japan . <\s>
<s> At that time , I could go there soon because I did not need to gather friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , individual travel has a lot of chance to touch local people . <\s>
<s> When I travel individually . <\s>
<s> I try to talk to local people for knowing the real situation that I can never know from reading a guide books . <\s>
<s> When I went to the United States individually this January , I got wonderful experience thanks to talk to local people . <\s>
<s> When I spoke to police in New York , I could enjoy to speak English and have fruitful talk with police . <\s>
<s> If I went to New York in a group , I could not have such an experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , from these reasons I do not agree that the best way for trip is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I this growing population and devoloping technology , people show up with more needs every day . <\s>
<s> But these needs can easily be displayed in an ostentatious ways like making the product seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Even though the consumer already now that the product in not going to be a real solution to their question , they easily can get amased by the showy advertisements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe the best way to sell a product hides under the showy advertisements . <\s>
<s> Lets say there are to different componies which are trying to sell their hair loss product . <\s>
<s> The X company says that this product is not only going to be the permenant solution but alsothe costumer will be able to see the result in 2 weeks , even though it does not work like that . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the Y company just says that the consumer will easily see the hair lossing problem ending in 3 months , after finishing the first bottle of that hair solution . <\s>
<s> Also they add that if the buyer would like to see the permenant answers they have to use 3 bottles . <\s>
<s> I believe it is not that hard to decide choosing the product that work for you . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My answer would have been saying yes to the first company and buying their product which they empysize their product under the name of permenant solution . <\s>
<s> With that word group they can easily get the buyers attention , because the person who has the hair loss problem dos not want to face with the problem or spend their my on 3 bottles instead of 1 . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As buyers we should not believe every word we hear on commercials . <\s>
<s> We should be more picky . <\s>
<s> I absolutely disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concepts is maybe necessary but learning facts is obviously the most important matter in education life . <\s>
<s> My personal experiences have proved me that being aware of universal realities is worth to sacrify everything . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , facts are indispensable for everybody . <\s>
<s> After one learns the facts , one can understand ideas and concepts more easily . <\s>
<s> Namely , learning facts is the first step for being a cultivated person . <\s>
<s> For instance , in our education system depends on understanding and memorizing concepts and events . <\s>
<s> Thus , the students in Turkey are lack of discovering and realizing the facts . <\s>
<s> It is a huge problem for us and our posterity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , Learning facts will affect the students whole cultural and social life . <\s>
<s> If one does n't know the truths , how one can define his own way to live . <\s>
<s> Therefore , if we want individuals who ere enough concious to determine what is really good for them and their country , we must give extra importance to the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it is evidently more essential for pupils to have the facts than to memorize or learn ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Learning facts is the most impatta <\s>
<s> Unfortunately i am not totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is for sure that success encourage people to discover or invent new things but if there is risk i am not sure that every people would be courage enough . <\s>
<s> After knowing how to succeed feels some people would like to live with it instead of trying new things and have risk to fail on it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is obvious that if you can not take risk you can not success . <\s>
<s> But risk is something you can take mostly when there is nothing you can use . <\s>
<s> For instance think about a director who had won Oscar Prize . <\s>
<s> Now he did the best at his work and now people all over the world know him and expects a lot from him . <\s>
<s> The hardest movie he can make is his next movie . <\s>
<s> Since he already is known as best and he has to be the best for rest of his live . <\s>
<s> But what if he wants to direct another kind of movie than he always do ? <\s>
<s> And what if he fails ? <\s>
<s> You think he can be that courage to risk his famous for just to do his ambition . <\s>
<s> I think not many people would do that ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But on the other hand if people keeps doing same thing then who going to discover or invent or try new things ? <\s>
<s> Only the young people or the people who never had got awarded yet ? <\s>
<s> But what about experience then ? <\s>
<s> Experience is important to success something . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To put it in a nutshell i would like all successful people try other things than they had already done . <\s>
<s> That is how creativeness can improve i think . <\s>
<s> But also i dont believe most people can take risk . <\s>
<s> I agree the statement that successful people try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s> Those who were did something well tend to challenge for new things because they think that they will be good in other things . <\s>
<s> The risk is not important thing as they succeed . <\s>
<s> That 's why many successful people do new things even if they take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When I went to Japanese middle school in Japan , I had joined gymnastics club . <\s>
<s> I like gymnastics because I liked gradual steps to get new skill , and I can have successful feeling after I practiced the skill many times and did it . <\s>
<s> If I suceed in one skill , I could practice more difficult skill which may take risks , such as injure . <\s>
<s> I always tried to challenge new skill because I want to get the skill and show my friend how I am great . <\s>
<s> I did not care about the risk because I thought if I think about the risk , I cannot do anything . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The novel , great business , by Kyoko Mori shows how the certain businessman succeed and become boss of his company , although he was bottom of status at first . <\s>
<s> Tsukasa worked very hard for his family . <\s>
<s> As he worked many hours without any absents and his grade was the highest among the collagues . <\s>
<s> One day , he was suggested by his previous boss that he should be the boss of his company . <\s>
<s> Although he was uneasy since he need more responsibility to be the boss . <\s>
<s> However , finally , he decided to be the boss . <\s>
<s> He did n't mind the risk and become more successful person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Success often lead to another steps that people have never did . <\s>
<s> That 's important thing for people 's live . <\s>
<s> People cannot afraid of taking risks . <\s>
<s> They always have to challenge to do anything . <\s>
<s> In my view , In twenty years from now will be more cars in use than today . <\s>
<s> So I disagree the fewer cars in future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , It will be changed that people buy a car more cusually . <\s>
<s> Although , people started concidering environmentally friendly socity , like recomending a pubulic transportation , bus or subway . <\s>
<s> More atracting having a own car nowaday . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many car company are very competitive , producing a nice , new modle stayl every year to attract consumers thouth a media , televison , internet . <\s>
<s> And a cost of per car has been aceptable for even young single person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fortermore , a life of each family member might be more imdipendent . <\s>
<s> havind a car for as personal belings will be possible in nearlly future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , New nutural enegy or electronics engine have been found instad of oil gas . <\s>
<s> new type of car only uses a little oil and conbine electronic enegy and it is already useig some region . <\s>
<s> they are low cost and environmentally harmless for earth . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally . <\s>
<s> I assum that even a lot of cars in future dose not pollute as much as used to be . <\s>
<s> but more number of cars will appear . <\s>
<s> And I disagree that it will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> There are many reasons for this agreement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , young people take more rescue than older people . <\s>
<s> They can start any new venture , they can get into any new adventure . <\s>
<s> While older people being experienced and having lack of energy are not ready to take rescue . <\s>
<s> I belive to enjoy a life one needs to be ready to take new paths which will require rescue taking abilities which generally youngsters are fully equipped with . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , young people are very immature as compared to older people . <\s>
<s> Being immature they can take fun in small activities , gossips , hangouts with friends . <\s>
<s> They have not seen the hard parts of life so they tend to believe everything and try to take things light heartedly and enjoy whatever they are involved in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , older people have fewer friends as compared to youngsters . <\s>
<s> Friends are the most important means to achieve happiness and to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Having few friends make older people feel lonely since they have few people to share their joy and happiness . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , youngsters are always busy with friends . <\s>
<s> Youngsters have too many people around them to share their achievements and happiness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fourthy , older people are misers . <\s>
<s> To enjoy life I believe one needs to spend money on his comforts and luxuries . <\s>
<s> Money can bring the means to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> For example one can go for a world tour if he can afford to do so . <\s>
<s> Older people do not prefer to spend money on unncessary things , while youngsters enjoy spending money on friends , parties , travel . <\s>
<s> Because of being misers older people prefer to spend time at home . <\s>
<s> They do not believe in parties and always try to save every penny . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In sum , I believe young people have more fun in life than do older people have . <\s>
<s> The application of the knowlegde and skills of a future professional decide the relevance to understand ideas and concepts or to learn specifically facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I aggre with the concept that one student need to understand the idea and the concept of a specific topic in a knowledge procedure . <\s>
<s> It need to be the beggining to develop a task . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Actually , the education in different countries is based only in the ability that one person has to select practical alternatives looking for give problems solutions . <\s>
<s> When the problem can not be solved with the different options suggested , it could present in the person a disability to understand the magnitude of the situation and to generate a new alternative . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To learn fundamental ideas and concepts offer at the professional , the capacity to review and find an alternative way for a solution . <\s>
<s> When an individual apply works with mechanical procedures without learn the fundament of them , he will not be able to find , control and correct mistakes in an anormal condition . <\s>
<s> For example , when a person who works as technician , with a basical formation only in the development of procedures in field to determine soil or water samples , will be not able to determine what is the real importance to take and manage this samples with a specific protocol . <\s>
<s> In the other hand , is he has a conceptualization of his work empahsized in the relevance to generate a quality results , the technician will not work in a `` mechanically '' form . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , the apprenticement of facts looking for practical , fast and short decision is actually expanding in the normal education systems , where the education orient students to know the answer for a question that he needs to select from a test of multiple selection not paying attentio to the mistakes is more important than the formation of a person who need to analyse the fundament for that answer . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that Young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Although I agree with this , I think there is a difference of the meaning of `` enjoy '' between young people and older people . <\s>
<s> At any time , we have a large generation gap between youngs and older people . <\s>
<s> And I think nowadays that gap is increasing more and more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I want to show the example of the conversation between my mother and I , when we were watching `` Gohst in the Sell '' , which is Japanese TV animation about the future world that people live with robots . <\s>
<s> In the story , almost all people have a computer brain in thier head instead of real brain , and they can process the information or the data that they see through thier eyes , like a computer now we are using . <\s>
<s> In that world `` ture human '' which are like us , are decreasing . <\s>
<s> Even they have a real brain in thier head , which is just tiny part of it for living . <\s>
<s> After watching this animation , I excited about the concept of the sotry . <\s>
<s> For me the computer is a really familiar thing . <\s>
<s> Everyday I use my computer for the assignments which are given by my high school teachers . <\s>
<s> Also I stoarge my favorite pictures , musics , and movies in my computer . <\s>
<s> So when I watch `` Gohst in the Sell '' I even thought that I want the computer brain in my head ! <\s>
<s> But my mother was defferent . <\s>
<s> Firstly she could't understand any concepts about this story . <\s>
<s> She could't understant why the computer brain in people 's brain , why they are not robots and so on . <\s>
<s> Finally she said `` It is so boring . '' <\s>
<s> In truth , there are lot of dificult words about computer system , and also confusing time passege was in the story . <\s>
<s> But I really suprised at the fact that she did n't enjoy the story . <\s>
<s> And I realised that what I enjoy is not always what my mother enjoys . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The meaning of `` enjoy '' is different between young people and older people . <\s>
<s> However as I said above , these days , technology is everyday improving . <\s>
<s> New things such as computers are sometimes difficult for older people . <\s>
<s> But I know that there are many ways of enjoying life . <\s>
<s> I understand that everyone enjoy thier own life very much . <\s>
<s> Some people may say that they need to broaden their knowledge in many different subjects to get more chances . <\s>
<s> But I believe that it is more important to be specialize in one specific subjects than knowing little about everyting because of two reasons . <\s>
<s> Which is that it is a waste of time and effort and that the company wants a specialist in certain field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , studing all the subjects that you do n't need is a waste of time and effort . <\s>
<s> People are living in a busy life and I think that they should put these effort and time to their majors . <\s>
<s> For example , in Korean high school we have a lot of subjects that you do n't really need . <\s>
<s> Students do n't understand why they are learning this but they are studying for these subjects just because of the exam . <\s>
<s> I think that students should instead put their time and effort in the fun activities or hobbies that they like to do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , thesedays the companys need specialists who are good at one specific field . <\s>
<s> This is becoming popular because most of the colleges have many programs that the students can just get into college with one subject that they are really good at . <\s>
<s> These subjects can be such as computer skills , launguages ability , arts and ect . <\s>
<s> Thus , if you are way better at English than most of your friends , you can develop on your language skills to be better at it and you will become a specialist that many company wants to hire . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Because of these reasons I think that having a subject which you are extremely good at is better than being just good at many subjects . <\s>
<s> I believe that each every one has different interests and talents which should be encouraged to be develop . <\s>
<s> Some people think the successful people always try the new things and take risks , whereas other people think the successful people usually do what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> As my point of view , I think the successful people will try to use the different views and do the distict things that other people never do before . <\s>
<s> There are several reasons to support my viewpoint as below . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I suggest that the successful people will always view the things in the different way , That is because the society now changes dramatically than before . <\s>
<s> Therefore , if we did n't know the trend of society , we will be phase out one day . <\s>
<s> In this situation , successful people must be a person who monitors the change of the society and always reminds himself to be the pioneer of the society . <\s>
<s> In this reason , they will always to be the person who have willings to try the new things and to understand all the new concept of lots of fields such as political views and managing perspectives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , since the competition of the world is enormous and lots of the things is changing day by day . <\s>
<s> A successful people must to be use the latest way or thoughts to keep up his advantages . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if someone always focus on what he has known and what he is good at , he will never know that the new things have brought the quite big impact on the world and his skill will be never be used in the future . <\s>
<s> So , a successful person must be a person who always know the trend of the world and try the lastest the method to deal with the things he faced . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To take Bill Gates to be an example , he is no doubt to be a successful person who try the new things and take risks rather than only doing what he already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> He has the uniqe view to realize that the software will be very popular and important in the world . <\s>
<s> Although lots of people though that the software was not so vital as the hardware is , Bill Gates still insisted his opinion , and then created the Microsoft and to be one of the greastest influencing person in the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think the successful people must be a individual who have brave to do somethings that no body have courage to do it . <\s>
<s> Therefore , he can always keep his advantages and continuously create the new things and bright the benifit for the world . <\s>
<s> I believe that understanding the ideas and concepts is more significant than learning facts for students . <\s>
<s> There are two reasons which make me think like that . <\s>
<s> First , when the student try to understand the main idea of a particular subject , it is easier for the student to examine what is really meant . <\s>
<s> By this way , the student gains the opportunity to think and critisize the concept of the subject . <\s>
<s> When the student has the ability to critisize , the student may draw new conclusions for that subject , I mean the student may have a different point of view , and discuss its advantages and drawbacks with his classmates and professors . <\s>
<s> This really helps to improve the thinking skills of the student and very useful for further researches such as attending a graduate program after the school , if he intends to . <\s>
<s> Second , as we know the human brain is open for new ideas , memorizing what is told in the class would not be helpful to the student for his upcoming classes . <\s>
<s> Because when you just memorize the facts without knowing its causes for a specific time period , for instance memorizing classnotes before the exam , it is inevitable to forget all of it after a meanwhile . <\s>
<s> To conclude , I think learning the reasons for a certain subject is for the student 's own good to understand a specific subject clearly . <\s>
<s> Facts are those that often people believe . <\s>
<s> If the facts are not derived from the ideas and concepts of the relevant subject then they does'nt have strong roots to be considered as facts . <\s>
<s> People are almost all fooled if they believed in the facts in which they does n't have enough understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> so i prefer in ideas and concepts in which most of the facts are emerged . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In favour to my decision i can suggest the examples of physics area in which Newton has made a theory that every body in the universe is attracted towards the earth due to gravitational force . <\s>
<s> This fact has not just emerged from the idea that an apple thrown up has fell down . <\s>
<s> He went deep into the idea why the came down and made him do a research that prooved their is a force of attraction towards the earth . <\s>
<s> As a result we learn today the Laws of Newton . <\s>
<s> so as far as the example is concerned i strongly believe in ideas that led to facts and the student community should focus on that The example i give is the invention of electricity that Benjamin franklin has given . <\s>
<s> The mere idea that she felt the shock during flying her kite didnt led to the electricity . <\s>
<s> she made efforts to learn why this happened and she felt that their are some charge particles which are responsiponsible for that shock . <\s>
<s> This led many theories in physics and later scientists created wonders with this concept . <\s>
<s> The argument can proved in all other areas not only in science . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students does understand the facts unless they are projected with concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> So unless the facts are supported with enough ideas and concepts the facts are never facts and there will be a black spot always if it is believed blindly <\s>
<s> Some people believe that it is better to have broader knowledge than specialize knowledge , others think not . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I would agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> There are many reasons as followed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , we could combine many different knowledge into one way . <\s>
<s> If we learn as many academic subjects as we can , we might put them together one day , and inventions will happened . <\s>
<s> Take the invention of cellphones for example . <\s>
<s> As we know , somone invented traditional phones , he used his academic field to invent it . <\s>
<s> But , nowadays , we increase the profits on many special kinds of cellphones . <\s>
<s> That is , what will make commercial profits ? <\s>
<s> It is not only the professional part but also combines others , such as ads and designs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , we can communicate with each other by using other several academic knowledges . <\s>
<s> In the other words , our friends may appriciate us because of our wide knowlege . <\s>
<s> We will not have a good social relationship if we only concentrate on our own field . <\s>
<s> It is because that we are too boring to stay with . <\s>
<s> Thus , we should get more and more academic subjects as we can , then we can chat with any kinds of friends who take part in different fields . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , we should also specialize our academic subjects . <\s>
<s> It is because that when we work in our professional part , we should give a confidence to our customers , it is impossible that we put too many emphasis on other things but cannot answer any questions which our customers asked . <\s>
<s> Moreover , we should study hard to our own academic field and we could get a better job than broader knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As all reasons I have mentioned above , the first is that it is important that having broad knowledge to combine them into a new one . <\s>
<s> The second reason is that it is easier to communicate with any kinds of persons . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , if you want to get a better job , you should specialize your academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Successful people always try to learn new thing and tell you wheter or not they had a good experience or not . <\s>
<s> Experiences are what you would like to have to get into a job and it is always good because you get to leat something . <\s>
<s> You can learn `` that '' something that people might not know about and share it with others . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I really agree with this susuccessful people because I am one of them . <\s>
<s> When going to the school you might experience new things by risking yourself and asking question in class in a positive way , not by being rude or trying to get attention from your classmates . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is always way to take a chance of trying something new because of the things surround you . <\s>
<s> Technology is the best new thing in the world , and scientist and mechanics try to do new things with their ideas like the newest car that does n't need you to go and pump gas in it but just charged as your cell phone . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A good example of a rich successful person can be your dad that is working on the computer everyday taking care of his stocks in the market . <\s>
<s> He risked himself by putting what your house is worthed in businesses that can really do very well or do bad and lost all his money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example , are the pharmacists and doctors that save lifes everyday by using new medication and work it on pacients to get their life on . <\s>
<s> You cannot just use herbs like traditional people to fight the HIV , but try to look for medicine that can cure or technology that can let you see how the virus does his dirty job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , amazing new ideas can come to your mind and it is your decision to follow it or let it go . <\s>
<s> But for later on , you might be sorry of not trying what is now conventional and revolutionary . <\s>
<s> Do like the million dollar guy , Donald Trumph , take a risk and a chance to get into new things and learn from it . <\s>
<s> The bad experiences let it go away , because it is not worthed . <\s>
<s> `` There is always something new to learn about '' . <\s>
<s> there are many types of teaching style in school . <\s>
<s> Some teachers emphasize to understand idea and concepts , but others emphasize just fact and result . <\s>
<s> Both of teaching styles might have adventages . <\s>
<s> However , I think the statement that unerstanding idea and concept is more important than learning facts . <\s>
<s> Before we know a result , we have to know procedure , and we have to understand ideas and concepts to know procedure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In Korea , they emphassize fact and result . <\s>
<s> we just learn how to approch the facts and results . <\s>
<s> we do n't know why some facts do that . <\s>
<s> we just know the facts . <\s>
<s> We just memorize the fact . <\s>
<s> For example , when I learned about multipling , I just memorize the facts as 2 multiply by 2 is 4 , 2 multiply by 3 is 6 . <\s>
<s> It also happened in high school because students in Korea have to take a Korean S.A.T for going to university . <\s>
<s> Korean S.A.T questions want to just fact . <\s>
<s> In contrast , In the united states , they emphasize to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Students in the United States learn mathmatics less than Korean students , but they learn why the fact happens . <\s>
<s> It 's different . <\s>
<s> Students in Korea learn `` How '' , but Students in the United States learn `` why '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A friend of mine , for example , came to the united states when he was a high school students . <\s>
<s> At that time , he was good and high grade about mathmatics in his school in the United States because he previously learned in Korea . <\s>
<s> However , when he went to a university , and he also studied mathmatics , he could n't very well rather another american studens because he did n't understand the ideas and concepts , also he did n't know procedure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> it is not only mathmatics . <\s>
<s> So , I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important and a kind of best learning skills . <\s>
<s> The statement advocates that having broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects is better than having specilization on one . <\s>
<s> However , in my opininon , the question can not have a binary answer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There could be situation when a broad knowledge of all concerned subjects is really needed . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , in some cases specilization os more important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In some case , one might just need particular skillset and other skills might not be of much use . <\s>
<s> For example , an MBA student who is aming to become an investment banker need not be strong in all the management subjects , but he/she really need to be specialized in fiannce . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , sometimes job requires a good overall understanding of all related topics . <\s>
<s> continuing on the last example , if the same MBA student want to be a genral manager in a firm , he/she should have a broad knowledge of all the management practices and subjects . <\s>
<s> In this case , specilization can not be of much use . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There could be cases when secilization is needed ` on demand ' . <\s>
<s> Once one might be working in some area , and sfter some time he/she might need other skills . <\s>
<s> In such case one need to have good knowledge of all related subjects . <\s>
<s> With a solid foundation like this , one can gain specilized skills easily if needed and this wopuld not require seperate acadmic specilization . <\s>
<s> For example , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , in my opinion , while one must have some knowledge of all the concerned area he/she is supposed to work on , whether specilization is required depends on specific case . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , its better to be master of one , while sometimes being jack of all trades might be more useful . <\s>
<s> If I will have a both of things , as good as it gets but I 'm not a superman . <\s>
<s> So I think that it is better to have broad knwledge of many academic subject . <\s>
<s> I see the problems in painter 's sight . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am a painter . <\s>
<s> but I studied in Economics in undergraduated . <\s>
<s> and I prefer to studying Fine arts . <\s>
<s> I have a great exprience than other artists who just studied art . <\s>
<s> So I have a greate advantage of my new major . <\s>
<s> I can organizide my articles in economic ways , and I also use economical thinking in my pieces . <\s>
<s> It is a great thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fine arts is very difficult . <\s>
<s> Painters should have painting skills and they also should have social thing , philosphy and many other back ground . <\s>
<s> If you had the specific background , you have great adventage to doing art . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In now days , Post modern things flows very strange ways that we had never seen . <\s>
<s> You are artist , but if you have a idea , you should not draw painting . <\s>
<s> I know , it heard so strange . <\s>
<s> but idea is everything for pieces . <\s>
<s> Where is idea from ? <\s>
<s> It from very various background , broad academic things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you had a many academic subjects , you can use a everything for your art . <\s>
<s> Did you studied biology ? <\s>
<s> You can use it . <\s>
<s> When artist have a broad knowledge , people can more feel about pieces . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Someone said , The articles not explaned it 's visual , it just explaned logic . <\s>
<s> What makes logic ? <\s>
<s> It makes only broad knowledge of many academic things , backgrounging these knowledges , you have a <\s>
<s> It is well known that gazoline is the main driver in car production . <\s>
<s> in fact , if the gazoline cost too much , people will less be likely to buy cars . <\s>
<s> As a result two potential hypothesis concerning the future of cars can be find . <\s>
<s> First , the decrease of gazoline will limited the numbers of cars . <\s>
<s> Second a new powerfull subtitued will be find . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To answer the question : ` will the number of decrease within twenty years ? <\s>
<s> ` , this essay will explain the two hypothesis , their consequenses and it will conclude buy answering the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first hyppothesis stating that a decrease in gazoline supply will decrease the number of cars . <\s>
<s> It is comon sence . <\s>
<s> If the gazoline suplly is limited the price will goes up . <\s>
<s> As a result comsuption and demand will goes downs down . <\s>
<s> In twenty years , people will find-out that having a car and especially with gazoline into it has becomes a luxury good . <\s>
<s> People , individuals , will not be a afford the new prices of gazoline , only major firms or government . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second hypothesis is more relevant . <\s>
<s> Find new sources of energy is possible . <\s>
<s> We already develop the nuclear which is of course not the best solution for cars but show how human been can find alternative solution . <\s>
<s> The ` ethanol ' which is a comple nature source of power can be a solution for cars . <\s>
<s> What we need to underline concerning the Ethanol is that the smoke created out of the car using it is horrible . <\s>
<s> it just smell very bad . <\s>
<s> unless a solution concerning the smell is find it will not be the best solution . <\s>
<s> Entire cities of Ethanol 's car can not be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I belive that the number of cars will decrease within the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> Alternative solution are possible but , not easy to find and use . <\s>
<s> However , the price of the alternative powers or the comon gazoline will be high or going up . <\s>
<s> As a result , the number of cars can only decrease with time . <\s>
<s> Lets not forget that numbers of cars must decrease unless the hole earth will suffer . <\s>
<s> Now advertisements have come to pervade every aspect of our lifes and , as a result , we can see advertisements every where , where in the school or in the store , where on the TV or on the newspaper . <\s>
<s> Some people think that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s> I agree this point . <\s>
<s> I will reason and give concrete evidence to support my point . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , I think the products in the advertisement seem much better than they really are is because that a lot of company want to earn much from their product and so they boast their products by using various kinds of methods . <\s>
<s> So the products seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s> For example , a advertisement says that this new product is beneficial to people . <\s>
<s> Maybe it just benefits the old people and maybe it just benefits to the children . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , I think that different people have different opinions when they talk about the same topic . <\s>
<s> As for advertisements , some people like advertisement because they think that advertisements can tell them about the new products and they can learn quickly aobut the new product from the advertisement and then they believe the advertisements ; while others do n't like the avdertisements and they think that the companies alway boast the founction of the new products and naturally they think that the products seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s> For me , I do n't like the new things and I always doubt about the new products and naturally I feel that the products in the advertisement is not as good as what they say . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I believe that products stated in the advertisement seem much better than they really are . <\s>

<s> Take the risk ! <\s>
<s> It is an one of the rules in guiding the way to Success . <\s>
<s> It has always been that successful people have been noted as Risk-takers when they face a critical cross in the lives . <\s>
<s> They try new things instead of doing only things that they already know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Trying new things will not always lead into loses or disappointments . <\s>
<s> On the contrary , it sometimes lead to new paths , and great brand new results . <\s>
<s> It is in fact the way behind most of the discoveries and inventions of the human race . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , Christopher Colombus was so persistent in running after his dream of sailing into the east through the Altantic ocean , and not through Africa to the Indian ocean . <\s>
<s> After he got his nessecary funding , he took the risk of shipping into the Atlantic ocean , though many people thought that earth was flat , and then eventually , he and his ships will fall down to to the bottom of Hell . <\s>
<s> But , his out-of-the-box thought led him to discover the Americas . <\s>

<s> In fact , he tried sailing to the east , and he reached a land that he thought was India , but it was not . <\s>
<s> His discovery has changed the whole world and humanity . <\s>
<s> Moreover , it proved that the earth is not flat , but rounded shape . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , we have seen that successful people did not do what they already know to do well , but they take risks that led them to the glory of success . <\s>
<s> In my opinion it may be better to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects rather than having knowledge on a single subject and it may not be true always .. <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , i believe this because now a days the competition is more . <\s>
<s> It may be touf to compact with this competition we must have our leg on different areas . <\s>
<s> For example take a company it wll prefer the employee who done a business course and degree course rather than the person with only degree course . <\s>
<s> This is because they think that he wll be usefull to the organisation more than the later . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> second , Every subject we learn wll be usefull to us in our life at a point . <\s>
<s> For an instance take mathematics it wll be usefull for us to calculate the sum , measure measurments etc . <\s>
<s> So if a man have knowledge on only one subject it wll be hard to survive the life . <\s>
<s> And he shold depend on others for simple reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , Some subjects may be disappear . <\s>
<s> This is because lak of intreset in that particular subject . <\s>
<s> Take a subject that is not intrested by many of the students for example history . <\s>
<s> Many people donot like the history subject because they feel it bit boring . <\s>
<s> If they donot have a knowledge on history then there may be the consequences like forgetting our old traditions , cultures completely . <\s>
<s> Which may not be good . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although we must have a broad knowledge on many subjects we should be perfect in a specific subject that is our intreset of study . <\s>
<s> By getting a minimal knowledge of the all subjects may answer all the question posed above . <\s>
<s> But itself wll not be sufficent . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advantages of having a knowledge on a specified subject are as follows . <\s>
<s> By getting more information on the particular subject may help us to built our carrier more systamatically . <\s>
<s> Not only that by having a more knowledge on one subject helps us to motivate developing new ideas . <\s>
<s> We may know the erros generally done by the people and we may solve them easily effectively and more efficiently . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So we have advantages in both of the statements ! . <\s>
<s> so i like to solve the problem by saying that `` It would be good to have a knowledge on subjects to all subjects in young age say before graduation and have a knowledge on specific subject from the graduation which will sounds good for all the answers '' . <\s>
<s> There is in my country an common and old proverb that says : `` Innovation is the mother of the success '' . <\s>
<s> I have mentioned this proverb because I definitely agree with the idea that the most successful people try new things and take riks rather than only doing what they already know . <\s>
<s> People who try to introduce and develop new ideas and take riks get good recognition and can achieve most often the succes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If societies and business want to develop in a good way , they need to introduce innovative ideas and new developments . <\s>
<s> For that , usually societies and businness appreciate so much the people who have new , creative , and innovative ideas . <\s>
<s> In fact , societies and business give the best recognition and gives the best rewards to the most innovative people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , the people who try news things achieve , under normal circunstances , the best results in their carriers . <\s>
<s> The big corporations have established a rewards programs and competitions to promote innovation in the organization . <\s>
<s> Organizations know very well that innovation is crucial to continue in the market . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the organizations give the best positions to the people with the most innovative way of thinking , and they do not give the most important positions to people who just do what they already know . <\s>
<s> It is common to listening in the organizations a general suggestion to the workers : `` Think out the box '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the new ideas and new developments in the business and even in the societies come from the people who try new things and who take risk . <\s>
<s> This kind of people normally get broad rewarded and usually are the most successful people . <\s>
<s> I do agree with the statement ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . <\s>
<s> By doing so , they also bring about a change in the way of how things carry go on conventionally . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We do have well renowed people in each field say cricket , art or music who have given it a new definition by trying out things differently . <\s>
<s> Let us consider the example of ` Abraham Lincoln ' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During those days , when blacks were discrimated . <\s>
<s> It was he who fought against it by taking numerous risks and stood for them and became one of the most famous presidents who ruled America . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We do have several business who have started their career with hardly a few penny in their pockets and did eventually turn out to be of the most successful and richest people . <\s>
<s> By doing so , they do increase the economic growth of the country by giving new ideas but also do stand as a paragon for others to follow their footsteps . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Apart from the business field , we can also consider great personalities who have renounced their life for the sake of humanity . <\s>
<s> For example , let us consider the example of Mother Theresa . <\s>
<s> She could have always let her own life in luxury and peace rather than spending her entire life for a different country and leading an austure life . <\s>
<s> She has taken various pains in helping out the needful . <\s>
<s> She has also contributed so much to the society by building many santoriums and homes for the poor and old aged people . <\s>
<s> I agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are . <\s>
<s> Let me talk about two reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One reason is that products in magagine advertisements seem more beautiful than they really are . <\s>
<s> For example when the beautiful woman wore a dress in the magagine advertisements the dress seemed so beautihful because of the beauty of this woman . <\s>
<s> But when I wore the same dress the dress did not seem beautiful . <\s>
<s> Because I am not beautiful . <\s>
<s> Also the shape of the dress changed because I was fat and the dress was really tiny . <\s>
<s> I could not realize that the dress was tiny because the beautiful woman in magagine was really thick and beautiful body . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second reason is that products in TV advertisements seem more useful than they really are . <\s>
<s> For example when the famous cook uses the knife in TV advertisements this knife will seem more useful . <\s>
<s> Because the famous cook can really can cook very well . <\s>
<s> But If I or my father buy this knife we will not use knife very well . <\s>
<s> Because we do not like cooking and we hardly use the knife . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore I think most advertisements make products seem much better than really are . <\s>
<s> i disagree with that say that after twenty years there will be fewer of cars than today , which can be answered at once without even thinking of reasons and someone would say : how we are going to move ? . <\s>
<s> and after thinking in the sentence , then all the thing and sircumstances around us doesnt agree with this sentence . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> first , until now the most effective and cheapest way to move from a special place to one another is to use my own car , in which i will be the owner of my self , and i can go from any place to another in conveient and cheap way . <\s>
<s> and if we think in a different way , like busses or trains , then i preffer using my own car to move rather than to use train or bus , especially in short movements , and because of beautiful things that are exist in cars those days , in which you can feel you are at home . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the second reason , is that the number of peaple using cars those days is increasing , and the need of cars is incresing , for example ; before 10 years there was only one car in my house , but now after we grow up , we need our own cars for me , a car for my mother , another for my sister . <\s>
<s> and that is clear for not only my family , for a lot of families . <\s>
<s> although , the demand of doing thing quickly ask us for more cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the final reason , as the oil exist , then we will have cars to move , especially , cars age now is 100 years , and the technology of prodction cars is now 100 years , so what can come in cars place and do what cars do with the same quality , the same luxury , the same performane with less problems . <\s>
<s> although , is it possible to find peaple to deal with any new technology within 20 years ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> in a conclusion , i can say that its imposible to abanden cars if there is not anything better to take cars place , especially we didnt hear any reasercher come with anythin new to take cars place . <\s>
<s> also , i think that the use of cars is incresing , and will continue incease . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Because I think young people can do many things than older people . <\s>
<s> For example , one of my experience . <\s>
<s> It was when I went to India . <\s>
<s> In India , we need a lot of power to walk , wating for vehicles , and so on . <\s>
<s> There are no official standard of the costs , so we always have to discuss with the drivers or selles . <\s>
<s> I felt they ware very stressful . <\s>
<s> Because of these reasons , I think they need a lot of physical power . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is pretty difficult for older people to travel to India . <\s>
<s> It is a special case , but I think it is adjust not only in India , most of other countries . <\s>
<s> second , last year my father broke his leg and he became not to be able to run fast . <\s>
<s> He has many hobbies , like golf , climbing mountains , and playing sports and so on . <\s>
<s> But now he can not almost of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The doctor said to him that the reason he broke his leg is that he moved too much despite of his age . <\s>
<s> These days , he always says to me that I had better do various things while you are young . <\s>
<s> Now , he cant . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , there are some things older people can do too . <\s>
<s> But while , there are a lot of things they can not do either . <\s>
<s> And they are going to increase . <\s>
<s> Because of these reason , I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Education system based on unchangable knowledge , leads students to learn this ideas ; and this undesirable situation will continue for a long time and it seems to pass over next centuries . <\s>
<s> In spite of the fact that it is more important and preferable choice to learn the facts instead of learning same ideas and concepts all the time , it is necessary for students to be successful in their class , and also many teachers do n't open new facts in the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , for many students , it is quite important to succeed in their lesson ; so it motivate them in a way that they should learn ideas and concepts instead of facts . <\s>
<s> The education system in our country is also the same . <\s>
<s> Many of my friends try to learn something that is given in classroom and do not give any importance to search facts about that subject . <\s>
<s> It is enough for them to know the idea , and other aspects of that area is not necessary . <\s>
<s> This reality is not something appreciated , but systems make people behave in such way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other aspect of this choice is based on some teachers who are quite old and still try to teach and give lessons to students . <\s>
<s> They don ' want to learn new innovents in the world , and try to create students in a way they know and think . <\s>
<s> If student do n't lead the same way , their teachers always criticize thame and do n't threat them in a nice way ; therefore many student feel upset and it will affect their study life badly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it is more important to understand ideas instead of facts to be more successful in this education system , and also to get teachers admire . <\s>
<s> Otherwise , students can face with some unpleasant situations and it could make some bad influences on their working area in the future <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that is more important for students to understand ideas than learn facts , but with some limitations . <\s>
<s> I think that for young people is very important to understand concepts in a deep way because after the graduate they should use what they have learned . <\s>
<s> So is good that university force students to study a lot and do conceptual exams . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But many of the people that attend university are not young , and for them i think that the lesson have to be more interactive and with facts . <\s>
<s> Infact they need to match what they are studing with what they have learned from their experience . <\s>
<s> For a young student this is not so important because we do not have work experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I attend the second year of undergraduate course in Bocconi , a university of economy in milan . <\s>
<s> During the course often happend that the lesson is boring . <\s>
<s> The lessons usually take about 2 hours each and it 's difficult to keep the concentration during all the time . <\s>
<s> It will be better if sometimes the lessons contain facts because that help to hold the concentration and sometimes help to understand concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With this type of lesson students can both learn concepts and facts , start to understand how the things they are studing are related to the work . <\s>
<s> In my opinion good universities should prepare you with lots of concepts but also with some real example to apply what you have learned . <\s>
<s> Moreover you can chage your idea during the life but before you have to understand that idea . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts are better than facts for students but a preparation only with concepts will not make you able to join the world of work . <\s>
<s> Although some people prefer to say that the advertisements show what you got , I prefer to say that this might not be the case . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , The people that make those advertisements not only have a gap in the knowledge of about the characteristics of the product , but also they have a good knowledge about how to use secret messages that makes the product essay to sell . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the following essay , I will defend my opinion with pertinet reasons and illustrative examples . <\s>
<s> Most of the people that meke advertisments for whatever product is on sell , they realy do n't know the characteristics about the product . <\s>
<s> If some company is seeling shampoos for example , they are not going to tell you the specifics about that shampoo . <\s>
<s> Even more , they wo n't show those characteristics that makes the product cheap on the at . <\s>
<s> they prefer to show us only the good things about that product . <\s>
<s> I believe , that this happen because the companies want to make money as soon as they can , and they do n't pay attention on waht is realy important for costumers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> They realy know how to sell the product , not because they studyied the product , like the shampoo I just said above , they realy know how to sell the product because they sometimes use secret messages on their advertisements . <\s>
<s> For example , they show up on their advertisements nude women , they use sex to sell , and as a result of that they sell more and more shampoos , because everybody wants to look like that woman or that man . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the essay above , I have defended my choice with pertinent reasons and examples . <\s>
<s> As you can see , I rather buy my staff not paying attention at the advertisements , and I strongly recomend to get more knowledge about the staff that you are just going to buy . <\s>
<s> In my opinion it is more important for students to understand concepts than to study or learn the facts pertaining to the subjects . <\s>
<s> I have experienced a lot of problems in this matter in my childhood days where i usually concentrates more on the facts than ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One such experience occured in my tenth class where i usually learn facts of my subjects such as physics , social , mathematics before exams . <\s>
<s> By the time , it is ready to write the exam i usually forget most of answers or facts which i learned earlier and get less marks in exam . <\s>
<s> My friend of mine on the contrary , usually concentrates on ideas and concepts in physics , social subjects and he is able to reproduce successfully what he learned in exams without any trouble . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another experience i faced , when i am writing entrance exam for Engineering course , where i concentrates more on formulaes and principles related to mathematics and does not concentrate on ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Due to tension in the exam i am unable to recall the formulaes what i learned and ended up with low score on the exam . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However for undergraduate students it is not necessary to understand ideas and concepts pertaining to their subjects because actually undergraduate course is of four years so it is hard to remeber ideas and concepts for various subjects . <\s>
<s> Instead they must remember only facts except their favourite subject , where they are going to do research in graduate coure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion one thing can be drawn that students must study ideas and concepts upto intermediate education and not necessary to remember concepts in their undergraduate course . <\s>
<s> The humankind always need to trying to reach goodlife standarts therefore trying new things is a very important aspect of humanslife . <\s>
<s> Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of trying new things . <\s>
<s> Some assume that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrary to those som think that people should execute things which they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I actually agree with the first idea . <\s>
<s> these are my following reasons <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , success is releated with responsibility . <\s>
<s> When successful people try new things and take risks they trust on their responsible characteristics . <\s>
<s> For example i know a proffessor who is so successful at his job . <\s>
<s> Furthermore he always knows his duties and behaves according to it . <\s>
<s> In addition to this he never leaves his jobs about a luck . <\s>
<s> He usually plans his works and live for it . <\s>
<s> Actually this feature brings the success to him <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition to this , success is reletead with the experience . <\s>
<s> If a person has experiences about the life or business or human psychology he/she can get the success very easily . <\s>
<s> Also these experiences help the person to try new things and take risks with a comfortable way . <\s>
<s> Plus the person can feel relief depending on the experiences . <\s>
<s> for instance i have a friend who is so willing to travel and see the world . <\s>
<s> Moreover she has many kind of experiences all over the world . <\s>
<s> Basically these experiences help her in her job to be more successful . <\s>
<s> She does not afraid of trying new things thanks to her experiences . <\s>
<s> If the people do not live the experiences they can not know the things which they face . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The last but not least success is releated with knowledge . <\s>
<s> Knowlegde enables the people not to hesitate try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s> Furthermore people can get the risk more easily because of the fact that they can know diversity of information what they will do . <\s>
<s> Next people can feel more self confidience with the knowledge that they have . <\s>
<s> They do not think what to do in a long time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all as i said before success is releated with both the responsibility and the experience as well as the knowledge . <\s>
<s> These valuable things make people try to new things and take risks than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> The long and the short of it is that there is an old saying that change brings life . <\s>
<s> i hope people do not disregard what i mentioned <\s>
<s> Today you found a lot of products on the market . <\s>
<s> Many firms give you a big variety . <\s>
<s> On the one hand there are different kinds of products . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , there are differences within one group of product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the following paragraphs , I explain , why I agree with the statement , that is told . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An important aspect of a product is the function , that means , whether the product could work in the way , it is bought for or not . <\s>
<s> In regarding to that , most advertisements do not underline the function ; they replace the main point with other extra facts . <\s>
<s> Sometimes it is impossible to find out which product is the best or functional . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To explaint it in a clear way , let us use an example . <\s>
<s> A mobil phone is a important part of modern life . <\s>
<s> If you want to use it only for phoning , than you do not need a camera . <\s>
<s> But such an additional function can confuse you . <\s>
<s> But it is important to know , that it could be differed between several countries . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another main point is that products with advertisment cost sometimes more money , than similar products without the advertisment . <\s>
<s> You have to find out , if you need the advertisment . <\s>
<s> Sometimes it costs less money to buy the advertisment seperat . <\s>
<s> If you want to have a personal computer , it cost less money , if you buy for example a painting programm seperate than as a part of the personal computer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result of those reasons I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I think you have to find out , what you want to have and for what use you need the product . <\s>
<s> Also , a comparison between two products or more but of the same kind of product could help you to find out your personal solution . <\s>
<s> The products can be from different firms . <\s>
<s> I HAD JUST READ A SAYING `` KNOWLEDGE IS THE ART OF KNOWING THINGS ORGANISEDLY '' I STRONGLY AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT . <\s>
<s> A PERSON MAY HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF MANY THINGS , BUT ONLY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT . <\s>
<s> BUT WHAT IS THE USE IF HE INTENDS TO SPECIALIZE IN A PARTICULAR FIELD . ??? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> IN THIS CASE HE WILL JUST STRUGGLE IN ALL THE FIELDS . <\s>
<s> HE WILL NOT HAVE ANY THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE IN A FIELD . <\s>
<s> HE WILL HAVE A MIS - MATCH OPTION AS TO WHAT TO CHOSE AS HIS MAIN STREAM . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> CONSIDER A PERSON WHO IS WELL QUALIFIED FOR A PARTICULAR TRAINING . <\s>
<s> SIMILARLY ALSO CONSIDER A PERSON WHO IS JUST A PERSON WITH WIDE KNOWLEDGE WITH EVERY FIELD BUT NO SPECIALIZATIONS . <\s>
<s> SUPPOSE IF BOTH ATTEND A JOB INTERVIEW , IT WOULD BE A CAKE-WALK DECISION TO CHOSE THE PERON WITH THE RIGHT QUALIFIATIONS FOR THE RIGHT JOB . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> IF A PERSON IN HIS CHILDHOOD IS QUESTIONED WHAT HIS PLAN TO DO IN THE FUTURE WAS , HIS SPONTANEOUS ANSWER WOULD BE A DOCTOR , ENGINEER SO FORTH . <\s>
<s> BUT NO ONE RESPONDS THAT THEY HAVE PLANS TO HAVE WIDE KNOWLEDGE IN EVERYTHING . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I PREFER THAT LEARNING A SUBJECT WHICH INTERESTS US MOST IS DEFINITELY INCREASING OUR GOALS . <\s>
<s> SPECIALISING IN A PARTICULAR SUBJECT HAS ITS OWN ADVANTAGES . <\s>
<s> WE GET TO HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE AND FURTHER WORK ON THE SUBJECT MORE KEENLY . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> BUT MY IDEA IS NOT TO BE A BOOK WORM !!!!! <\s>
<s> WE SHOULD EXPLORE THE WORLD AS IF IT IS OUR OWN . <\s>
<s> BUT SPECIALISATION IS ALSO NECCESSARY ! <\s>
<s> THOUGH A WIDE KNOWLEDGE IN ALL FIELDS IS ALSO ESSENTIAL , SPECIFIC GOALS ALSO OUGHT TO BE PRESENT WITHIN EVERYONE . <\s>
<s> I believe that successful people try new things and take more risks than other people . <\s>
<s> Being successful means to built new ways . <\s>
<s> When we search about successful people lives we could see what made them successful is that they find new subject , creat something new , they found new ways , new styles etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To continue what you know well does n't make you successfull but it can make you experinced . <\s>
<s> Being experinced is a good and essential for doing a job but it cannot built your ability to create something and change your life style or thinking style . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When we look at some artists or scientists life we could see that they tried to live in a different way and change sometihng which they never lived before . <\s>
<s> So what makes people remember and artist because he different things and make a cange in people lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Why Gandhi is well known figure in the World that he does n't want to live like all people live in his country and he made a decision and take a risk . <\s>
<s> The risk also can take his life from him but without taking any risk no matter can change . <\s>
<s> It is so politicial issue to discuss in this section but I want to mansion about only one thing if he never want to change his life and protest soldiers with a quiet way he can never show the people how successful politition he was . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people have take risk to be successful , and being successful also needs new things to try and never give up . <\s>
<s> When asked about whether there would be less cars in twenty years than now , different people , however , have different viewpoints , depending on their personal experience , insight of the development of nowadays society and some other factors . <\s>
<s> The prediction , nevertheless , is difficult to make . <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , the number of cars in twenty years will increase in developing countries . <\s>
<s> On the other hand decreace in developed countries . <\s>
<s> Among those countless factors that affect my opinion , I would only explore a few primary ones as follows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The essential reason why cars in developing country will become more and more in 20 years is that developing countries are more likely to develope their industry as their first goal in the follwing years . <\s>
<s> As a result , car , an important criteria to show the level of the development of a developing country , will be more and more under the leading of government . <\s>
<s> A good case in point is the faster and faster growing number of cars in China . <\s>
<s> The goverment of the country has recently imported the core technology of car-manufactory from some Japaness company . <\s>
<s> This would lead to the decline of the price of cars in domestic market to encourage people to buy cars . <\s>
<s> So , there is no doubt that there would be more and more cars in China . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I believe that in developing countries , there will be more and more cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And an important reason of the decrease of number of cars in developed country is that the developed coutries are paying more attention on the protection of enviroment in these years . <\s>
<s> And their public transportation system is good enough to support the growing number of people who use bus or underground . <\s>
<s> Countries such as England , Fance and the USA are now undergoing the situation I have illustrateed above . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As , what has been discussed above , you will be sure to know why I has the opinion stated in the first paragraph . <\s>
<s> Personally , I do prefer to travel by myself . <\s>
<s> Traveling with a group has limitances that I think reduce your experiences in a place you have never been at . <\s>
<s> Everytime a person is leaded by a guide , his preferences or opinions are more likely to be affected by other 's opinions and , also are predeterminated by a person that already has a point of view based on his own experiences . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When a person travels by his own , the only way to enjoy the travel is to be always aware of the world around , due to it is a new place and your senses are open to any movement . <\s>
<s> It is exciting because if you do n't take care of the things around , bad experiences will happen easily . <\s>
<s> From this perspective , there is not doubt that traveling in group is much better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A group gives you a safety sensation , even if you do n't know the people around , a feeling that whatever happens you will have somebody to share with , negative or positive . <\s>
<s> Also , a lot of friends can be made in a group trip , I believe it is another advantage . <\s>
<s> It is usually a long time spending together with new people that at the end , you share your new experiences with them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In other hand , traveling alone is a great idea to make new friends . <\s>
<s> Although it is true that it 's only you in the trip , it does n't mean that it is only you at the places you are visiting at ! <\s>
<s> Also , at the end , you will share your experiences with other people and the most important , other 's will share experiences quiet different from yours . <\s>
<s> As far as you are willing to meet new people and know different places , a predeterminated group is not necessary to enjoy a trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In regards of the tour guide , from my standpoint , learn and search information by myself is the most reachness way to expand your knowledge about a new place . <\s>
<s> A tour guide will only tell you typical things , memorized information from a book or a little guide . <\s>
<s> Then , if I just want to know general things , I do n't need a guide , I need a book . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Traveling by your own , you need to get information , maps , places and people . <\s>
<s> However the difficult but also the most rewarding part is not to have the data , is how to get this data . <\s>
<s> Due to there is nobody that will provide you all the instructions for the next day , schedules and rules , it 's necessary to create yours . <\s>
<s> Creativity is the most important ingredient in a succesful trip , you need to define what to see , when to be there and how to enjoy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides , traveling in group is much more expensive than traveling by your own , and in fact , it has sense . <\s>
<s> If you want somebody to be your tour guide and a complete schedule of your next days activities , you have to pay for it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , a traveling experience is much more appreciated when it is created by the person , it is a way of live a trip even before you leave home . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree or disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I think that there are benefits as whell as problems related to traveling in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some of the benefits of traveling in a group with a guide in my opinion are : if you have a profesional guide he might shown you places that are not so common for tourists and that otherwise you would n't know of ; he could also tell you some history behind a place ; and the most important for me , normally locals know the best places for having a great lunch or dinner . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some of the problems that one might have while traveling in a group with a guide are : you need to follow a schedule , so there is not to much freedom ; the guide will show you what he thinks is the most important sites , but that does mean that you will agree with that or that you will enjoy that ; there is also the economical aspen the guide might not be cheap enoght for you to pay and finally there is the group issue , the group may not the type of persons that you would like to share your vacation with and this could make the trip less enjoyable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I thinks that you need to evaluated before getting into a travel group if that is realy the type of experince that you what to get out of a specific vacation . <\s>
<s> If you are going to a place for the first time or for shorth time a guide could be good idea . <\s>
<s> On the other hand if you are visting a place for the second time you might already know what do you want to do for the trip and whell as when , so not being with a guide will probably be better then . <\s>
<s> Will the advertisements make products seem much better than they reallt are ? <\s>
<s> I 'm going to have to say that I agree with this statement because I am one of the people who watches advertisement show and buy products that I want . <\s>
<s> I do n't think this is a good way to choose which products to buy , but how are we going to buy the products without an advertisements ? <\s>
<s> And why dose it make products seem much better than they really are with advertisement ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The answer is really simple , it 's just that some compnay make look the products better in advertisements . <\s>
<s> Basically what they are doing is lieing . <\s>
<s> In oreder to find a good products without using the advertisements , people should ask their friends about the products they want to buy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One day , I bought this watch that was said in the advertisements that this watch never brakes and could hold on to great amount of gravity . <\s>
<s> When I went into the deep pool , it was broken . <\s>
<s> I was really sad and mad at the same time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisements make the products sound better , but the product it self is n't good as what is said on the advertisements . <\s>
<s> Since the product it self is n't good as it says on the advertisements , the company who pruduce the products would not make a great amount of money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Like I said in the beggining , I do agree with the statement , but I do n't agree using the advertisements to sell the products . <\s>
<s> Without a advertisements , it would tough for the compnay to sell . <\s>
<s> Same as people who wants to buy the products . <\s>
<s> For doing this , only the good products which costs less and has good quality is going to be sold . <\s>
<s> What is the purpose of making an advertisements ? <\s>
<s> Customers could be the advertisments . <\s>
<s> I do agree with the fact that : in twenty years time , there is diffenitley going to be much fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> and the reasons are multiple and very logic , first of all and most importantly is fuel , obviously and up to now every car as any other machine needs some sort of energy to function , in case of cars this main source of energy is oil , and as we all know the oil reserve in the plant is decreasing every day , and the supporting examples in this case is very clear , and it has been proven scintefically that the oil reserve is dramatically decreasing . <\s>
<s> secondley is maintenance of cars , which is aslo proven to be very costly process . <\s>
<s> another good reason is expansion of people , buildings and other things , which is making space less available for cars these days . <\s>
<s> another very good reason is the availability of other ways of transport , which is making it easy for us to commutte with less effort and lower cost , and at the same time giving us other safer ways of transport and the supporting example here is the very bad safety records of cars as method of transport . <\s>
<s> I personally think that the most important reason and supporting examples for the above mentioned fact , is the effect of cars on our environmint , the amount of CO2 emmission cars throughs into our environment every day is unbelievable , and i think it is the main reason which is going to make the number of cars is much fewer in the future . <\s>
<s> At first sight it appears to be easier for young people to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> The context of academic studies , into which most young people are , makes it a lot easier to repeatedly meet new people , and also provides them with a lot of free time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Everything is yet to be discovered , and a lot of activities are designed for younger people . <\s>
<s> Being in a better physical condition during youth allows you to practice sports , even if it is still possible for older people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> ln our society , adult life is mostly devoted to work . <\s>
<s> It does not leave a lot of spare time anymore , and often its primary function is just to make a living . <\s>
<s> It seems to be harder to find one 's life exciting then . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But enjoying life as an older person is not impossible , it is just more challenging : a good career and an exciting job , or just a happy and united family can give a feeling of acomplishment that it is impossible to have as a young . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Each stage of life thus has advantages and inconvenients , but no one is more enjoyable that another . <\s>
<s> The feeling of happiness is only psychological ; there is no age to be an optimistic person , or to have a passion for kittens or anything else . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One should keep in mind that someone 's life is what one does with it ; there are always means to make it more enjoyable . <\s>
<s> Enjoing life <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> ` `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' <\s>
<s> In my openion i think it 's not true that young people enjoy life more than older people . <\s>
<s> Happiness does n't come by age it comes by satesfaction <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> You may find a young man who can do every thing he wants but at the end he is not happy . <\s>
<s> Or you may also find a young man who he is not happy because he does n't have the aportunity to get maried and to creat a familly . <\s>
<s> Enjoing life is not about doing things that will make you feel younger . <\s>
<s> You may find an old person who he enjoys eech second he spends in this world by seeing his grandchildren . <\s>
<s> It depend through the persons intrest . <\s>
<s> For example my father is an old man who have grandchildren but he is enjoing his life by spending time with his family and taking care of his house . <\s>
<s> His happiness when he sees his children and espescialy me because i am the youngest getting high grades in school . <\s>
<s> This is what happiness mean . <\s>
<s> I strongly belive success requires to try new things and take risk in the life . <\s>
<s> Everyday is first day of rest of our life and can be a new refreshing start . <\s>
<s> A new start / change gives more energy to accomplish . <\s>
<s> As we all know ; all methods and ways change by the time . <\s>
<s> Even the way we think , we see the world need to be changed as well . <\s>
<s> The way people travelled , dressed has been continiously changed over years . <\s>
<s> The way govermenst admimistrates , companies advertises changed as well . <\s>
<s> Even today war strategies changed . <\s>
<s> Keeping same way and insisting in doing things old fasion way can not be a key for success . <\s>
<s> We were not burn as a fully experienced educated person . <\s>
<s> During life or school we continously learn and experience things . <\s>
<s> One time things we thougt was best to do may not be right to do later . <\s>
<s> Even the the right things we have been doing may not be best to do an other time . <\s>
<s> I exprienced these from my own life . <\s>
<s> I worked as a pizza maker for 3 years in the past . <\s>
<s> I was a good professional pizza maker but i was not happy with may job and never felt i was successful . <\s>
<s> I never thought it was right for my caracther and abilities . <\s>
<s> I wanted do a different job have more action involved . <\s>
<s> I took risk of changing my job and established a company . <\s>
<s> Now i sell overseas and earn lots of money . <\s>
<s> I go different part of the world and do different things every day . <\s>
<s> I feel more happy and successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful is the level of life makes you happy . <\s>
<s> If you dont feel happy with what you have or what you are doing you should take risk and change it . <\s>
<s> To understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts . <\s>
<s> For example , the math is the important subjcet to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Students are not able to learn math without understanding the ideas and concpets . <\s>
<s> The Korean teachers value to learn facts . <\s>
<s> As the result , the students cannot understand the problems and use in the lifetime . <\s>
<s> The purpose of the learning is using in the life time . <\s>
<s> To learn the facts is required to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> The advantage of the human 's brain is enable to understand things . <\s>
<s> The students are going to school to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The purpose of the learning is using in the lifetime . <\s>
<s> Without the understading , everything is usless even though the student can get good grade on the test by learing facts . <\s>
<s> The counter who has shop next to my house is bad at counting . <\s>
<s> She told me that she already took the Algebra and calculus classes in her high school year . <\s>
<s> She is really bad at counting because the teacher teaches only the facts of the mathmatics and ignores to understand how the facts got . <\s>
<s> Understanding about the objects , facts , ideas , and concepts affects how the students live their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Without understanding ideas and concepts , the students can not learn the facts . <\s>
<s> The facts are proved by understanding about the facts . <\s>
<s> Facts is made by the person who understands about that facts and everyone could agree about that facts . <\s>
<s> Undestading concepts and ideas directly relates with learning facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advantage of the human 's brain is enable to understand things . <\s>
<s> Many animals can memorized the facts . <\s>
<s> Even the birds can memorize the facts and repeat it . <\s>
<s> If learning facts is more important than understanding ideas , the robots and mamals can be replacing us . <\s>
<s> Understanding about the human-being , objects , ideas and concepts are the very important advantages that human has . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are many things that people can learn and understand . <\s>
<s> It is required to be aware of why the students are studying . <\s>
<s> To learn facts , students have to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> The purpose of the learning is using in the life time , so the students need to understand ideas to use in the life time . <\s>
<s> The students cannot learn the facts without understading the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> They need to use the advantage of the human brain which is enable to understand the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concpets is more importnat than learning facts for students . <\s>
<s> Everyone wanted to be a successful person , right ? <\s>
<s> You and me want to be and everyone try to be . <\s>
<s> Everyone know that being a successful people need to be very smart and hardworking . <\s>
<s> Do you have ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you really want to be a successful person , you need to try something different between the others . <\s>
<s> Different things means try new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Be a successful preson should make some products or something can let the people forus on your new trying things . <\s>
<s> It should be fresh and new for the people . <\s>
<s> Then the people will disscus your products during their working time or shopping time . <\s>
<s> Immately your products will be a fashion , famous and everybodys topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course you need to have a lot of ideas . <\s>
<s> Otherwise you will out dated in the whole world and need to think a lot of new products pre year . <\s>
<s> So be a successful preson take risks is very important for the new ideas . <\s>
<s> I think they need to go somewhere travel and learn mor different culture . <\s>
<s> It should be suitable for them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do n't think successful preson only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> If you only do something you already know well it is improssble to successful because may be a 1000 people have the same company as what you already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> It is hard to show up in that much company . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To be a successful preson is really hard . <\s>
<s> in the next few years the technology will develop more than today . <\s>
<s> so i agree with this point of view that in twenty years therr will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because in future because of development of science and technology the trains will develop more than present days . <\s>
<s> and it is to travel by train than by cars . <\s>
<s> because trains are much more faster than cars and it will develop more . <\s>
<s> we can take the examples of metro trains of present days . <\s>
<s> these are much more faster than the old time trains . <\s>
<s> we can reach in few minutes to same place on which it will take many ours by reaching with cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> also in cars there is a pressure of driving . <\s>
<s> if our family is going on a place then one has to drive . <\s>
<s> if we are going on night then also some one has to drive which is very dangerous . <\s>
<s> also the person who is driving cannot enjoy like other people . <\s>
<s> in trains there is no pressure of driving and all of the family members can enjoy equally , because of the development it will become easier to afford the plains also . <\s>
<s> so everyone prefer plains rather than cars . <\s>
<s> as we all know that it takes only few minutes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> also in cars there is a very conjusted space which makes it uncomfortable . <\s>
<s> it is very difficult to travel long distances in cars . <\s>
<s> it is very expensive to travel in cars . <\s>
<s> because of the rising prices of the fuel . <\s>
<s> i think this is the big reason to the decrease in use of cars . <\s>
<s> we all know very well the fossil fuels are declining day by day . <\s>
<s> there is a big decerase in the natural resources from the last few years . <\s>
<s> so everyone must tried to control this . <\s>
<s> and we can do this by controling the use of fossil fuels . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> another reason for decrease in the use of cars is that it increases the pollution in the atmosphere . <\s>
<s> which is a very serious problem . <\s>
<s> as pollution create many kind of problems like many kind of diseases like skin diseases and also breathing problems . <\s>
<s> many children are suffering from these diseases in there young ages . <\s>
<s> so this problem can be solved by controllling the use of pollution creating vehicles . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> there is a lot of traffic on the roads also . <\s>
<s> which is very irritating . <\s>
<s> so we can avoid this by using trains and plains . <\s>
<s> so in next some years people will prefer less use of cars than today to all of these problems like pollution , traffic , longer time duration and also the pressure of driving . <\s>
<s> There are studenst in the world . <\s>
<s> They want to learn something from their teachers or their families to become success . <\s>
<s> If a student want to resolve the situation to become sucess , he/she must know the idea . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas is more important than learning facts for students because of the features and the usages . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students want to know the specialities of the idea and concepts . <\s>
<s> Specialities show where the topic comes from . <\s>
<s> For example Turks are living in a democratic city . <\s>
<s> If they do not know their past they can not know the importance of that democracy . <\s>
<s> For this reason people learn their past and their history . <\s>
<s> If people can not know their past and they live in domocratic country . <\s>
<s> they can not discuss or protest something is oppsed to their country . <\s>
<s> They must know how they become in this situation and they can use it if it is necessary . <\s>
<s> Knowing specialities means that knowinf ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Understanding what the idea is about is necessary for learning something . <\s>
<s> If a student start to learn something first of all she/he must know the name of the idea and than the information about the idea for using it . <\s>
<s> If she do not know anything about that she/he can not realise the facts . <\s>
<s> Facts can only demonstrate the results but to understanding well it is not enough . <\s>
<s> For example there is OSS in Turkey and the students study OSS for getting a chance to pass a good university . <\s>
<s> I studied too and I learned the idea and concepts . <\s>
<s> If I learn only the facts I can forget the facts during the OSS . <\s>
<s> Understanding facts means memorizing because we can not know the idea . <\s>
<s> We can only know the fact and this is not enough . <\s>
<s> For this reason teachers explain the topics with their concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> So the students can know the fact whenever they want because understanding ideas pass the people to the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To summerize understanding ideas is important for remember and using ideas . <\s>
<s> Many people are trying to succeed in their career . <\s>
<s> Some of them fails , but others can reach the goal . <\s>
<s> those people who became successful , used to work very hard but to be very well skilled . <\s>
<s> When a person succeeds , then they are more likely to chalenge themselves . <\s>
<s> Because they feel more satisfaction , they feel like they need to try themselves in higher position and in a risky situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When somebody has already succeeded on their normal life , they become proud of themselves . <\s>
<s> They feel happy and tend to have more self-confidence . <\s>
<s> That motivates the person to try something new and more successful things . <\s>
<s> They also could do everything what they would like to do if they have succeeded the most difficult in their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , that person , because he/she believes that everything will be fine , starts preparing to do new things . <\s>
<s> Even when something goes wrong , they believe that it could be solved quickly with their own experience and knowledge . <\s>
<s> Those backgrounds before being a successful people is another strengh to keep them trying on a new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason for people who takes risk is because they want the profe of being so well . <\s>
<s> Being such charismatic person is to say like being a hero . <\s>
<s> They want to realize and show other people that they are really a great person who does n't feel satisfied of what they already achieved . <\s>
<s> They want to see how much they can do further . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in words , successful people want to try new things for their own pleasure . <\s>
<s> They need to continue challenging something to be sure that they can go higher more than they are now . <\s>
<s> That desire of going upper is what makes the person chalenge in whatever thing they whant to achieve . <\s>
<s> That 's why the ones who reached the goal keep trying themselves to continue being better . <\s>
<s> In an aspect of shot time , It seems more effective to learn facts than understand ideas and concepts because we can see or realize that how much information or how many facts we learned and knew . <\s>
<s> However , I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of following 3 reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , understanding lasts longer than learning or memorizing something . <\s>
<s> For example , if a student understand the ideas that why sky looks blue when she is very young , she will know the ideas until she die . <\s>
<s> She can also explain it others who wnat to know about it . <\s>
<s> However , if the women learn it by heart without understanding , there is high possibility to forget about it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , understanding something has a power to apply others . <\s>
<s> There are two aspects in all information we face everyday . <\s>
<s> One is fact that we can see easily . <\s>
<s> It is like a penonmenon in nature . <\s>
<s> We can believe what we can see . <\s>
<s> The other is concept that we can see only when we study it and we understand it . <\s>
<s> If people understand a certain infomation , it means that people know how the information is formed , what the infomation and how they can apply it others . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is good for students because they must have interesing about the information when they can understand it totally and apply it others . <\s>
<s> It can make students keep studying and learning . <\s>
<s> Lastly , understanding ideas is less boring than learning fats . <\s>
<s> Students do not like to learn something without certain reasons . <\s>
<s> They are not interested in learning hard and difficult facts . <\s>
<s> Therefore , we make them understand something to learn . <\s>
<s> Understanding is different from learning . <\s>
<s> It can give students a motive to learn and let them feel funny . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Understanding is loger and interesting and have a power to apply . <\s>
<s> That is why I a <\s>
<s> Today , we can clearly notice that practical learnings is being more and more important when theorical learnings are seen to be more and more unefficient . <\s>
<s> In fact , there is fewer and fewer borders between people , all goes faster than in the futur . <\s>
<s> in a word : our society lives in the instant . <\s>
<s> That is why today , many students prefer learning facts than understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Something is true : students are not able to get rid off learning facts . <\s>
<s> A million of diplomas represents nothing without experiences in companies . <\s>
<s> it is very important to acquire practical knowledge and skills in order to be directly efficient when setting up in business . <\s>
<s> further , factual learnings are more attractiv than theories and students pay more attention to this way of teaching . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , it is impossible to learn pratical courses without a solid theorical background . <\s>
<s> why not ? <\s>
<s> it is so because markets , laws , and ratings change very fast . <\s>
<s> Theories change slowlier . <\s>
<s> Today many 50-aged people have problem in order to find a job after being made redundant because they do n't have any theorical background . <\s>
<s> They are obliged to go back to university . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> a pratical learning needs a theorical background . <\s>
<s> On the one hand , theories allow us to always have a guide in our work . <\s>
<s> if we must face a problem , we are armed for managing the situation . <\s>
<s> but a good knowledge of concepts and ideas without operational skills is absolutely unefficient . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is not more important than learning facts . <\s>
<s> Both walk together . <\s>
<s> we need both in order to be able to face with any situation . <\s>
<s> Student must learn facts , it 's true but without a basis , a background , they won.t be able to manage with the fast changes of the economical world . <\s>
<s> In my openion successful people try new things and take risk rather than going in the old fashion or method . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are a number of people who used new ways and helped them to succeed in their life . <\s>
<s> If they go with the old fashion as they already familiar with in their life , they may go in same way in the career which may not help in the challenging environment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Dheerubhai ambani , a great business person in India used to go in the new unconventional way in his life aswell as career . <\s>
<s> It worked alot so as a result of it he became a great person from school teacher son . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let we take about Google founders , they didnot gone in a old fashion . <\s>
<s> Even though they are software professionals , they didnot tried as normal employs . <\s>
<s> They wanted to go in a new way and wanted to take risk . <\s>
<s> They started with a new idea and now we can see the difference . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If all the persons going in the traditional way which already excisted no new inventions will occur . <\s>
<s> so people are going in new ways and succeeding in their life and in their career . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hollywood directors also comes under this same group . <\s>
<s> Most of the successful directors used to present their movie in a different manner with new ideas and some people tries to present their movies in the old fashions which already working . <\s>
<s> `` Jurasic Park '' came with this policy only . <\s>
<s> The producer and direcor knows that they are doing risk but they want prefer to go in the new way and they succeeded . <\s>
<s> Eventhough some movies with sory is coming now , we remembered only Sephen Speilberg , who started the way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Eventhough some people going in the same route and succeding , we can call them as followers not the initiaters . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I strongly agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' <\s>
<s> I really have to say < I do n't know > . <\s>
<s> This is a question that I ' ve discussed in the past a lot of time , particullary at the school . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that the students often think studying like a great possibility to improve their knowledge but also their personality . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a better man or woman in this society . <\s>
<s> An opened personal culture can give the possibility to have a lot of relationship . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The problem related to this opinion is the false dream that it gives to persons like me . <\s>
<s> I do n't think that the current society can accept a man or a woman that love learning many things , but noone like specific . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To find a job today it 's more difficult than ever , and if you have not a specific competence you will only enlarge the big world of unemployed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now I 'm still studying so I ca n't speak about the job world thanks to my personal and direct experiencies , but I can see my friends and my brother 's life . <\s>
<s> They have studied for a long time to be good workers , but I see this is not sufficient . <\s>
<s> The job and the society require everyday a better work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So like I usually have to do when I speak about the difference between a broad knowledge of many subjects and a specific one , I must write that today that 's impossible living in a dream , where everything in your opinion is interesting . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today the only possibility to create a future is to leave at home the passions and all the rest , and thinking about a specific competence that you like and that can give you the possibility to realize a part of your dream . <\s>
<s> I am agrre with the statement ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The successful people are always think about new things . <\s>
<s> Because that is their confident behaviour to reach their goals . <\s>
<s> If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think how to solve that problem . <\s>
<s> And they are perfect in that because they already doing their present job well . <\s>
<s> The persons who are already succed in their field are able to do any risks for new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The successful people try new things because they know the all secrets to reach the new goal . <\s>
<s> And they are able to face the problems occuring with new things . <\s>
<s> They try and they can easily done the new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company . <\s>
<s> Assume , he works on projects with ` C-Language ' , and he is very successful in that field . <\s>
<s> However , he has to learn the new upcoming softwares like `` JAVA '' , `` ORACLE '' , `` VB . <\s>
<s> NET '' , and `` SAP '' programmes . <\s>
<s> And he may take risks for that courses . <\s>
<s> He attended the coaching to learn those at the time after completion of his work in present job . <\s>
<s> He can effort more to learn those . <\s>
<s> Because he has to enter in that field to work . <\s>
<s> then confidently he can succeed in his thoughts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example , assume a successful state player of any game , he succeeded in his team with the state players . <\s>
<s> Then he try to get the chance in national team . <\s>
<s> He knows that it is very risk to get the place in national team . <\s>
<s> However he struggle for his aim . <\s>
<s> He is able to face the difficulties , because he already struggled to get the place in state level team . <\s>
<s> So it is easier to him to get the place in national team . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , with the resons and examples discussed above I am agree with the statement `` Successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . <\s>
<s> In this text i am going to deal with the question if young people enjoy life more than older people . <\s>
<s> Young people do not have a lot of problems like older peoples because they do not need to work for getting money . <\s>
<s> They get money from their parents or grandparents . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , young people do not have fear of the future , because they do not think about it . <\s>
<s> Additionally , they enjoy playing with their friends , e.g. playing football . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , young people enjoy about little things , for example a young child is happy about a small bubble gum . <\s>
<s> Young people like children have to do what their parant want because the parents give them a little money and food . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people have to work because they need money for food , a flat or a house , clothes and so on . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , they have not a lot of free time like young people . <\s>
<s> Otherwise , older people have some advantages like driving a car because of their work . <\s>
<s> They decide what they want to do and do not rely on other people 's decision like young people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , i think young people enjoy life more than older people because they do not fear the future like older people sometimes do . <\s>
<s> There is a statement that says `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . <\s>
<s> In this essay , I would like to respond to the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fisrt of all , I would like to define the word success . <\s>
<s> I define the word sucess as to achieve something that can be admired by others . <\s>
<s> So if there is someone that has done something that everyone else admires , that person is said to be successful . <\s>

<s> Now I would like to respond to the statement . <\s>
<s> People tend to admire someone who has done somthing that everyone else has never tried to do . <\s>
<s> If there is someone who has tried to do something that is tried by anyone yet and succeeds by doing it , everyone admires him/her for taking risks . <\s>
<s> This happens often in the world . <\s>
<s> For example , there was a physicist who invented an idea called `` anti-matter '' . <\s>
<s> This concept is never thought by anyone else because in order to come up with this idea , you need to take account negative numbers which do not seem realistic in this case . <\s>
<s> Now in physics , the concept of `` anti-matter '' is known and it seems to be true . <\s>
<s> The physicist who invented this idea becomes very popular and he wons a Nobel Prize . <\s>
<s> This example tells you how taking risks lead you to success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are many people who have succeeded due to their challenge ; yet there are also many people who have failed to succeed because they tried to take risks . <\s>
<s> In these cases , people ignore them and people only look at people who succeeds by taking risks . <\s>
<s> There is a bias and in order to discussing fairly , we need to know the risk of failing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are also people who have suceeded due to what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> For example , There is a famous football player called Ronaldinho . <\s>
<s> He has won a World cup and other titles as well . <\s>
<s> He has many great skills and his most famous skill is called elastico . <\s>
<s> However this skill is not invented by him and it was invented by a player called Falcan who played many decades ago . <\s>
<s> Ronaldinho uses Falcan ' s skill and he became very famous . <\s>
<s> This example tells you that doing what they already know can also lead you to success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The most important thing to succeed is not how to do ; it is how well you do . <\s>
<s> If you try something very hard and very effectively , there is a chance to succeed . <\s>
<s> I would agree to the statement becasue taking risks is better than `` only doing what they already know '' . <\s>
<s> It is good at doing what they already know but it is important to at least try to invent new things . <\s>
<s> I have a simple idea about this question , because there is not a subject more important than other . <\s>
<s> I think that a person must know many academic subject because it is a important for all life . <\s>
<s> For example in my school I study mainly lecterature , matematic and science . <\s>
<s> Probably in my future life i will do not use the lecterature or the science but I will use more matematic because I want to do a architect . <\s>
<s> This does not mean that I do not studi lecterature or science . <\s>
<s> It means that , of this two materials i can not know specific subject but it is quite a general knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To difference , probably i will use more matematic in my future work and of this material i must know more specific subject . <\s>
<s> My idea is this , It is more important knowledge of many academic subject but it is not important ( maybe impossible ( know all of all in specific . <\s>
<s> It is important have a general know of all and know the specific materials and aspect of own intrest . <\s>
<s> The specialize is a important aspect for the future work but it is impossible whitout a primary general knowledge . <\s>
<s> Many materials are correlated and more aspect are interrelated , so it is important have a general know of this . <\s>
<s> It is very erract think at general knowlwdge or at speific subject , both are important . <\s>
<s> In my specific , i like know many academic subject because i have many and different intrest . <\s>
<s> For example i like studies botany and pop music . <\s>
<s> Naturally i can not studi this in specific way but i try to do it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion i think that the peaple must know all in generic and some aspect in specific subject . <\s>
<s> The important is study very hard and <\s>
<s> In my opinion , there 's actually no certain answer to this question . <\s>
<s> It depends on different situations . <\s>
<s> In different cases , the qeustion has its different answers . <\s>
<s> We can not deny that some of advertisements do n't make products seem better they really are . <\s>
<s> However , most of advertisements make product seem better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some companies do n't make the advertisements of their products seem better than they really are because they know how important for their customers to believe them . <\s>
<s> If the make a very good advertisement of a product , people might buy this product . <\s>
<s> However , the product is actually bad . <\s>
<s> People would find that the product is not as good as it is in the advertisement they saw after the use it . <\s>
<s> It will make the customers feel disappointed and not trust that company anymore , so the company will lose a lot of customers . <\s>
<s> That 's reason why some companies keep making `` true '' advertisements . <\s>
<s> They want to have more returning customers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Those false advertisements are usually made by some small companies which do not care if they will have returning customers or not . <\s>
<s> Once these kind of advertisements are showen on TVs or newspapers , there will be a lot of people to buy this product . <\s>
<s> Atfer they use it , they will realize that they were cheated by the company and wo n't buy its products anymore , Some of those small companies usually do n't spent much money and time to produce those products , so that they will get more benifits from these products after the mass of saling . <\s>
<s> They do n't need returning customers because they already gain enough profits from the first time sale . <\s>
<s> However , it is also the only time for them to sale thier prod <\s>
<s> I would agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> I think successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , there are successful people who tried new things . <\s>
<s> Eveyone knows about these companies named Microsoft , Honda , and so on . <\s>
<s> These are now big companies but started by few people . <\s>
<s> They made new buisiness and made lots of money . <\s>
<s> Nobody thought that they were going to success first . <\s>
<s> They took risks and opened buisiness and successed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ssecond , even if you do n't try new things , some people ca n't success on their life . <\s>
<s> If both people who try new things and not try new things ca n't success , I think people who tried new things are more brave . <\s>
<s> Even if they ould n't success at the time , they might success next time . <\s>
<s> Because tthey once tried and learned what is not successful . <\s>
<s> Nothing is born form challenging new thing . <\s>
<s> I also think it is boring to do same things again and again . <\s>
<s> People used to live without light long time ago . <\s>
<s> Now , people invented light and we can do anything at night . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , I think their attitude for trying new things is hard but they can get to learn some thing . <\s>
<s> Even they cant success first , they will success at the end . <\s>
<s> People tend to respect who is working hard . <\s>
<s> Some people might bring good plan to you . <\s>
<s> I think the important thing is learning and not making same mistake again . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to above , I think successful people try new things . <\s>
<s> I want to success in my life so I will try new things . <\s>
<s> I want to challenge new things and learn lots of things . <\s>
<s> I hope those things I learned will help me in the future . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , driving cars will spend more money than other public traffics because the price of car fuels , gasoline and gas oil , will be raising . <\s>
<s> For example , I remember that in 2003 when I was in my first year at Showa-Shell-Sekiyu , a large oil company in Japan , gasoline price of Japanese market was less than one dallor . <\s>
<s> However now , it is raised about one half dollars . <\s>
<s> As the above example shows , driving cars will spend more money than other public traffics . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of cars . <\s>
<s> For example when I was a eleventh grader at Okayama Joto High School , a public high shool in Japan , I was able to swim in the river next to my high school after school . <\s>
<s> But now , the river has been very duty because the new road was made by the river and a lot of drivers throw away their garbage in the river . <\s>
<s> At last , our city makes a new low of emitting from the gas oil cars . <\s>
<s> If the number of cars had been increasing , the beautiful environment would have lost away . <\s>
<s> As the above example demonstrates , people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I strongly agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> Learning Facts means knowing the past , who the culture of every incident and every facts are created and followed by our people . <\s>
<s> I agree the above statement , Its is every important for a student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Learning facts are more essential than to understand these facts . <\s>
<s> Mainly the students must know about the fact and he must understand the facts and then he must understand the concepts . <\s>
<s> The importance of these facts show a good nature and brightness on the students by telling him or explaining these facts to him . <\s>
<s> He will be so active and will not do any misbehaviour in any certain accepts . <\s>
<s> After knowing the effectiveness on thes efacts the students will be more positive in nature . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The importance of these facts is , we can learn easily these facts . <\s>
<s> It is very difficult to understand and perform in the real life . <\s>
<s> But putting on to the real life this lead a big role . <\s>
<s> For example take a students , telling the future or subject is simple for a teacher , the student will easily grasp the subject , but inside these subject the exists some many facts that evena teacher does n't know . <\s>
<s> The Teacher must get through these facts and must explain to the students so they may understand these ideas and the concepts must explain by the teacher to the student as to developed the sudents brain . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For Example take our Indian Culture , We can tell the students that out culture is this and we must be in such a manner who our beloved neighbour and the past people will be living . <\s>
<s> The students make take this lightly and they may not be has every one live . <\s>
<s> They live ther own life . <\s>
<s> But if they understand these ideas and concepts they will complusory be like a past people be living . <\s>
<s> Students are only one who make bring out nation forward . <\s>
<s> so , they have to understand every facts and they have to improve the skills by calculating and producing the concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally i conclude that students must know eney moments and facts . <\s>
<s> Atlast i say that students must not only learn the facts but they must have understand ideas and the concepts . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Even though I think it ^ s true that young people has more power to do new things , so that can make them excited . <\s>
<s> About me , just few days ago I went to my x junior high school to get in the pool with my friend . <\s>
<s> It ^ s forbidden . <\s>
<s> in the midnight . <\s>
<s> We get over the fence and suceeded to get in the pool . <\s>
<s> We laughed and laughed and laughed . <\s>
<s> it was fun because the task was risky , wasnt allowed , etc .. <\s>
<s> too many reasons . <\s>
<s> Ill never forget this . <\s>
<s> So , young people can do anything , and easy to find something fun . <\s>
<s> I wouldnt find the stupid thing that we did fun when I got old . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But I guess there ^ s another way to enjoy old people ^ s life . <\s>
<s> may be to do flower arrengement ? <\s>
<s> Im not sure but , I think Any person at any situation can enjoy their life if they want to enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> My friend , who is 18 years old recently had to stay at hospital for almost 2 weeks , firstly she complained about that often like * why me ?? <\s>
<s> it is middle of summer break ! <\s>
<s> I had many plans that i cant do now ! '' <\s>
<s> I was sorry for her . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A week later , when I went to her hospital room , she was doing a game that I gave her . <\s>
<s> She had never played a game before , but she started , and found it so much fun , and she is still now a big fun of games , My grandfather , who is dead when he was 87 , I love him so much by the way , enjoyed his life soooo much ! <\s>
<s> he always said in his life time , that ` I am the happiest person in this world '' He went to war comming back with nothing , He lost all his family and house then , but he worked hard and he built 3 buildings and became quite rich . <\s>
<s> He was in hell once but he used to say that ` working hard was fun because the more I work , the more money I get ! <\s>
<s> money counting was the omly fun I have at that time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And He got me and my little sister as stepdaughters . <\s>
<s> He loved us more than anything . <\s>
<s> When he lost his ability to move his body , we went to his hospital everyday . <\s>
<s> He still said : Im the happiest person in this world `` then . <\s>
<s> As I am the person who feels OK to everything that comes to me , If you are not healthy , If you are not pretty , If you do not have boy friend , If you are not young , if you are not old , you can make your time or even your life full of happiness . <\s>
<s> Now a day , the most used way to move is car . <\s>
<s> From eighteenth century when the first car was producted , many changes have occurred in the cars market and in the ways to use this kind of transport . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Since the past , people needed to move from a place to another place . <\s>
<s> For this reason some kinds of trasport was invented , for example train , bus , airplane and car . <\s>
<s> The growth of cities made the need for people to find a way to transport over the city in a easy way , so they can get to work or to school , for that a personal transport is neeeded and the car is a personal one . <\s>
<s> Thus even more persons bought cars to move . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nevertheless cars produce a lot of pollution that contribute to damage the atmosphere in which we live . <\s>
<s> But at the present day , there is much more consciousness about this poblem , so many people are finding some ways to reduce the use of cars , for example using carpooling , or using public transport . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , at the present day there are a lot of cars that produce a lot of pollution , but I think that man is more counscious about this problem now as he was in the past , so i think that there will be fewer cars in twent <\s>
<s> Imagine the earth has nearly 7 billion inhabitants . <\s>
<s> Almost 60 percent live in Asia , which is a growing market for the car industry . <\s>
<s> Yes , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to the market in Asia let us assume that almost every citizien has a car down in Asia . <\s>
<s> The car industry is going to be as happy as they were never before . <\s>
<s> For instance they are going to raise their annual income to a never forseen hight . <\s>
<s> Which is good for the economy of the whole world . <\s>
<s> Because the rate of unemployment is going down enornormously . <\s>
<s> And every person who is working for the car industry will benefit from that boom . <\s>
<s> Firstly the employers live more savely because they are going to have more money to spend for luxury . <\s>
<s> But what is more the surrounding economy like the travel branche or the apparel industry is growing too . <\s>
<s> These are just two examples I like to indicate . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand all these cars are going to cause havoc to the environment . <\s>
<s> Most importantly to the air because the cars producing a lot of chemical stuff like CO2 which will harm the atmosphere . <\s>
<s> According to the atmosphere which is our weather kitchen . <\s>
<s> It produces rain , snow and even oxygen , without these elements we are not able to live . <\s>
<s> To put it in a nut shell even if it rains the rain is not free of chemical combinations . <\s>
<s> So the rain causes harm to the forests and animals and yes even to the whole mankind . <\s>
<s> Unfortunenatly none of our well payed scientists have discoverd a system to prevent acid rain , which is the main problem to the environment in which we live . <\s>
<s> So it is our task to save the nature for our fellowers . <\s>
<s> To ensure this task is going to be succesful we have to put more money into education . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let me sum it up , more cars of course , but not with more danger to the environment and mankind . <\s>
<s> Let us build even more environment friendly cars , like hydrogen cars or with solar power . <\s>
<s> Than there will be no harm the the atmosphere and everthing is okay for our future genarations <\s>
<s> There are some people saying that there will be more cars in the future than today , because the car is convenient for ourlife and it saves our time . <\s>
<s> But others say that in the 20 years after there will be small amount of cars than now , because the energy is running out and the car is no more can work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> These two opinions are reasonable , but I agree the latter opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , there is lesser and lesser petroleum the energy source of car . <\s>
<s> But those kinds of resources are limited and someday it will be runned out . <\s>
<s> Then , the car cannot work any more without constituting the energy source . <\s>
<s> But within the 20 years it will be impossible to develop and commercialize the new energy sources . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , there are many regulations and consensuses about prohibiting the air popplliution . <\s>
<s> The main source of air pollution is came from the car diving . <\s>
<s> It will be more and more lessened to use cars all over the worled . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , the traffic is so busy . <\s>
<s> There are limted roads available which the car can go . <\s>
<s> But it is overcrowded day by day . <\s>
<s> As a result , the government construct many different transportation systems , such as railroad , bus , and subways , which reduce the road traffic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In cities , at rush hours , traffic cause many people to waste their time on the road . <\s>
<s> It results inefficiency to their work and everyday life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , in twenty years , the cars will be used little than today . <\s>
<s> Because , there is little resources to run the cars , the car produce much polution which is regulated all over the world , and the traffic is so serious that the people use other transportation systems than choose cars . <\s>
<s> Well , this is an interstiong topic to be written about . <\s>
<s> Coming to the point of knowledge , it means that mastering a field of work at study . <\s>
<s> And this is divided into many branches like different subjects we take . <\s>
<s> Many people try to take a few subjects or a single subject alone for their study . <\s>
<s> This also counts for the field out of education system . <\s>
<s> This could be for the reason that they are interested in it and like to work on it . <\s>
<s> And moreover , people who are job minded , would work inyensively on their subject of choice to master it and a good job based on it , leaving the other subjects unexplored ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to me , the involvement of a person in a particular type of job is totally need based . <\s>
<s> But I would prefer to work on all the areas ad gain knowledge of everything around me , then concentrate on what I need to . <\s>
<s> This could be a pretty way to do our job . <\s>
<s> You will have the minimum kowledge of everything . <\s>
<s> This ought to be followed because , you cannot keep quite when group of your friends is discussing about a particular topic . <\s>
<s> You need not be familiar with it so that you can atleast join the discussion . <\s>
<s> Or else it would look odd if you dont join the talk . <\s>
<s> Afterall our skills are guessed by rthe work we put up . <\s>
<s> And we can also advice some person in a familiar topic we know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , lets take a person who is very well aware of a subject in which he is interested , but is unaware of many other things . <\s>
<s> And take person who does knows about all the things he is interested , and also the other things . <\s>
<s> For instance let us assume an interview conducted for each person . <\s>
<s> And in todays world , a person who knows his subject of interest and the other things also , is only accepted . <\s>
<s> That would keep him as an allrounder . <\s>
<s> Though the other person is a master in his subject of interest , that alone would not help him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly I conclude that , `` A sight towards the alrounder is always different from that towards a fish in a pond , which , though knows everything about the pond but never knows anything about thje world around it . '' <\s>
<s> Concerns about global warming and cuts of green house effect gases tend to make us believe that in the future , there will be less cars than there are today . <\s>
<s> However , I feel that this assumption is a bit rough and should be balanced . <\s>
<s> To put it straight I do not think that there will be a dramatic decrease in the number of cars . <\s>
<s> At least I do not think that it will occur everywhere . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , car is a means of transportation the advantages of wich are somewhat hard to challenge . <\s>
<s> It is probably the only means of transportation combining speed , 24/7 instant availability , high standard of comfort , security against attacks and possibility to reach in a decent number of hours any withdrawn place in a country . <\s>
<s> All other long distance means of transportation make you dependent on departure times , exasperating delays and complicated correspondances . <\s>
<s> For all these reasons I do not believe that need for cars will fall . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What makes us think of an upcoming abandon of cars is the feeling that huge expense is done to incite people not to take their cars in city centers . <\s>
<s> In France , for instance , constant effort is done to improve the standard of service of railway networks in major towns . <\s>
<s> For example , the city of Paris is building a tramway network at the moment . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , whatever important may be these efforts , cars will remain necessary to reach precise places at any time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , in the countryside , it will long remain excessively expensive to create a powerful transportation network . <\s>
<s> What I feel is the most elevant reason why cars will not be abandoned is the feeling of independance that they bring . <\s>
<s> For young people for example , buying the first is an important step towards independance fromth <\s>
<s> I agree with that students should understand ideas more than facts . <\s>
<s> With the development of technology , more and more people pay their attention on learning knowleged . <\s>
<s> But which is a correct and effective way to learn knowledge ? <\s>
<s> Some people may think that learn the fact is much better than learn from books , but actually they are totally wrong . <\s>
<s> Since if you want to understand a thing , the only way is to understand the concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , learning ideas is a system and logical study . <\s>
<s> It is going to help people learn a thing very logically and effeciency . <\s>
<s> For example , when you face a big problem , the first thing you should do is to find out what is wrong with it and then get to know how to solve it . <\s>
<s> These processes are all based on the understand of ideas . <\s>
<s> To imagine that you do not even know what is the idea , how can you solve it ? <\s>
<s> Obviously , the ideas are more important than the faces . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , the ideas and concepts can help students to see deep part of a thing . <\s>
<s> When you know the fact , you may think it is right or wrong from your point of view , but actually that 's may not true . <\s>
<s> At this time , you need to know the ideas , the idea can help you to analysis the thing , and make you really understand what is that mean or how things work , that 's really very important . <\s>
<s> A really understand is not mean you know the facts , acutally is the concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , learning of the idea is very essential and useful . <\s>
<s> Actually the idea is the main part of learning a thing , only if you understand what is the idea of it , then you can study it . <\s>
<s> For instance , when I read a book , first of all I need to know the concept of it and then I will read it and know the entire book spontaneously . <\s>
<s> So it is easy to see that an idea is very important even in our daily life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum of , the most improtant thing for a student to learn is the idea and concept . <\s>
<s> It will help you to understand a thing very logic and deep , more than just know the fact . <\s>
<s> Knowledge is the basic root of humanity development . <\s>
<s> It 's the foundation of any developed country . <\s>
<s> Knowledge can be gained from plenty sources . <\s>
<s> It could be wether from the internet , text books , researches or even from mass-media . <\s>
<s> But the point is which knowledge you intend to aquire . <\s>
<s> In which field you want to develop yourself . <\s>
<s> There are two kind of people when it comes to aquiring knowledge , The first one is prefer to be a wide knowledge man having a background in many fields , The second one prefer to be a professional one in his career . <\s>
<s> In my opinion and from my experience i think it 's better to be a professional in a specific career rather than normal in many fields . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> High rate of life and with the variety of information and cultures proposed through television and satellite . <\s>
<s> The person may feel that he got lost inside all of that . <\s>
<s> Knowing many information in many fields will make you lost inside them . <\s>
<s> consequently , you will not be a professional in your career . <\s>
<s> for example , am studying civil engineering , specifically in steel structure department and i think am a successfull man in doing my job and intending to get master 's degree which will provide better life for me later by having a better job with higher salary . <\s>
<s> while being a person have a shallow background in many fields will not lead me to a better life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> ` Best one among hundreds will take the seat ' . <\s>
<s> That 's mean that you have to fight in this time of life . <\s>
<s> You have to fight to find a job willing for a better life . <\s>
<s> Having a job these days is so hard . <\s>
<s> So you have to improve your skills . <\s>
<s> You have to be a unique in order to get a respectable job , high salary ones . <\s>
<s> while being a broad knowledge man will not lead you to the point that life needs nowadays . <\s>
<s> Once i heard a real story from a friend about finding a job in a multinational company . <\s>
<s> He told me that he went for an interview and surprisingly he found about one hundred and twenty person want to admitt for that job that will only choose one among them . <\s>
<s> i think that 's enough to make me prefer to be a unique and professional man rather than being a broad knowledge one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nothing is perfect . <\s>
<s> Everything has it 's advantages and disadvantages . <\s>
<s> But we have to focus on what we need and what the life want from us . <\s>
<s> Life is a good place if you come up with it 's needs . <\s>
<s> To be a wide range knowledge person will probably help you in many situation you face each day . <\s>
<s> unfortunately , it 's not the good time for that . <\s>
<s> Life is narrowing your future path in one direction . <\s>
<s> Which will definitly lead you to a better life and success in your career . <\s>
<s> In my opinion it is more important for students to uderstand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts . <\s>
<s> Although it is very important to know facts , because they are necessary to understad many of the events which are occurring in our day-life , it would be very hard to deeply understand them just learning everything by heart . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact , it is important to understand concepts because it 's very easy to forget facts . <\s>
<s> For example , it would be quite impossible to study litterature or better history just trying to remember al the facts by heart . <\s>
<s> Maybe it would be possible to learn like that for an university test but there are a lot of possibilities to fail the test because it 's very easy to forget some informations or to invert some facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , it would be better just to try to undersand and to make some general schemes about a topyc in order to have some clear and general informations and in this way it would be easier to remember the facts because they would have a logical order . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For istance , once I tried to remeber all the facts which occurred during the French revolution for an high-school test . <\s>
<s> I had little time to study so I thought that the better solution was to learn as much as possible all the facts by heart . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I did not sleep at all to be prepared for the test , but anyway , I did not pass . <\s>
<s> The test day I was so nervous and tired that I almost forgot all the facts occurring during the French Revolution and I was not able to pass the test , that it was actually very important to me . <\s>
<s> It would have been more usefull just trying to keep in mind all the main ideas and maybe I would have passed the test , or at least , I would have slept during the night time ! <\s>
<s> Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> First of all as we know in the market companies are trying to sell more and more to get money . <\s>
<s> The television and marketing on stores influenced on people about benefits of products and try to convincet you to buy them . <\s>
<s> For example products for women : creams and lotions antiaging , products to loose weight , products to make you hair nice , smooth or curly , etc . <\s>
<s> When I go to the store and I 'm looking for the best option for my skin and health I always read the ingredients , if those ingredients are vitamins , how to use it and contraindications on the box and I compare with others products . <\s>
<s> After a couple of months using the new cream I noticed that there is no positive change or improve , and talking to others people that the use the same product , I found out that advertisements and marketing either pictures or comercials saying buy others consumers that they try it before convincent people to use it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I agree that people can find a lot of products on the stores saying all the benefits or even lie with the only proposit to get them for more and more people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If I can mention more examples I 'll never finish because there is thousand of products seem better than they really are . <\s>
<s> In my opinion is how is made the advertisement and how much impact in people . <\s>
<s> If you dont try it and have the experience you 'll never know about the p <\s>
<s> The mans need for decrease in time for travelling has resulted in increased number of vehicals . <\s>
<s> The most common means of transport is through public . <\s>
<s> But , with growing needs of man this is not the case . <\s>
<s> Man has started to buy his own vehicals mostly cars as they provide a convenient mode of transportation . <\s>
<s> The one of the reasons behind this is that a car provides a perfect mode of transportation for the whole family . <\s>
<s> The car is more benificial as it provides a lot of space sit and provides a lot of space to carry things that are required to make a perfect holiday . <\s>
<s> this is unlike public transportation were you will have to carry your own luggage where ever you go thus , leaving your belongings to their own fate . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is an increase in number of cars used now a days . <\s>
<s> As they not only provide total satisfaction but also provide an image in the society . <\s>
<s> Today we distinguish people by their clothing , their social behaviour and their social status . <\s>
<s> Thus , in a race to prove their social status men have bought cars and bikes that are real expensive . <\s>
<s> Not only that the modern day youth is obssesed by the fastest cars available thus leading to increase in motor sports like formula 1 and etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advancement in technology has drasticaly effected the requirements to built a car that fits the modern day world . <\s>
<s> The companies like hundai etc ; have made techincal advancements like introducing microprocessor chips inside a vehical feul system . <\s>
<s> Have made the youth crazy them . <\s>
<s> unlike the past there are a lot of companies that offer quality products thus insearch of a good marketing stratagie these motor vehicals were made more technically equiped . <\s>
<s> Thus leading to technical advancements where one could automat his vehical to reach his destination , he could find which hotel is nearby and can even access internet and could see where he is . <\s>
<s> This is made possible through satellite communication known as gps . <\s>
<s> thus all these advancements in technologies would lure even a common man to buy a car rather than travelling through public transportation . <\s>
<s> Thus i see a growth in increase in number of cars rather than a decrease . <\s>
<s> From the primary school to the end of highschool , in France , England or in the United States , students learned a significant number of various subject which means they not have to operate a decisive choice in one or two subject they will have to study . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This choice of specialisation happens when they are graduated and have to go to the University . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Somebody who knows little things about a unbelievable number of academics subjects is cultivated and often it is interressant to talk with this kind of people because they always have something to say whatever the subject of the conversation but because he is not specialized he will maybe never teach you something . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In another way , speaking with a too specialised man could be fast becoming boring . <\s>
<s> But here is not the question . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I really think that is essential to master one subject perfectly , to possess a domain where you are excellent but I also believe that is vital to remains open to others academic subjects . <\s>
<s> For example , great thinkers from the past like R.Descartes had knowledge in mathematics , philosophy etc ... <\s>
<s> And I really believed it helped them to improve their predilection subject cause all or almost all academics subjects are related . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To my mind , beeing unskilled or too skilled in a subject are not good things . <\s>
<s> Between these two exteme models , everyone must find his own way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude I would like to add that our educational systems , often highly criticised , are finally not so bad . <\s>
<s> It offer the opportunity for the students to learn about a lot of thing , it gives them the choice to eperiment the subject they would like to study later . <\s>
<s> Understanding facts are more important than understanding concepts . <\s>
<s> Some people said `` We have only some real facts and others are theory . '' <\s>
<s> But I disagree about that because of make problem when we make standard , make confuse , and attitude . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When I was in high school in second grade they have problem in Korean SAT . <\s>
<s> They make a question about universe . <\s>
<s> But the fact is different from the answer because our text book is old one . <\s>
<s> Some students complain about the question . <\s>
<s> The goverment have to agree about that . <\s>
<s> So they have to make two answer at one question . <\s>
<s> Even it suppose to has one answer . <\s>
<s> Our country usually think facts is more important than concepts . <\s>
<s> But this kind of problem always happend when they make standardize test . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Make confuse is other important reason that I disagreement . <\s>
<s> If school teach concepts more important than facts they have to make mistake when they teach their student . <\s>
<s> They have to make some example for explain their concepts . <\s>
<s> But Concepts is more important than facts they use wrong example but easy to explain that concepts . <\s>
<s> Maby this problem make students dum . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If school teach concepts more than facts students atittude can go wrong way . <\s>
<s> In every work or problem they just think about the problem 's concept . <\s>
<s> If they get bad grade because they use wrong facts they always complain to teachers and schools about their grade . <\s>
<s> They think they are right because they use right concepts . <\s>
<s> Their facts are not important for them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Learning concepts is useful for study ; because it 's one of the easy way to unerstanding problem . <\s>
<s> And it 's work pretty well at socail work . <\s>
<s> But in math and other important sceince subject it never work because it does n't need wrong facts for explain their concepts . <\s>
<s> I quite agree with the statement'intrinsic meaning . <\s>
<s> I would personally support the idea that the kwoledge of concepts and ideas is extremely functional in order to better understand facts and phenomena . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would like to clarify my point , stressing the important functional relation that exist between the two cognitive processes . <\s>
<s> Actually , I would get beyond , saying that undersanding concepts and ideas is essential in order to ace real phenomena . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For instance , we know that many wall street investment banks sistematically hire Phd students from top US school , for their researche departments in order to get a better understanding of what was going on around the economic world and for bringing into their organization the great theoretical kwoledge they have . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On an overall basis , It'also real that learning facts gives an important opportunity for students in order to put on to a practical dimension what they have learned from books . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> a clear example of this approach is provided by the Harward business school teaching method . <\s>
<s> It was totally based on bringing real business cases into the class , so that the students could touch the essence of the reality , and at he same time , improving their problem solving skills . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would better suggest to see the problem in its complementar nature , saying that the two aspect are both important and students should enrich their knowledge regarding concepts and ideas but simultaneously go in depth analisying real life facts , getting a more pragmatic view . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This approach is intended to be largely supported by stronger relationships between Academic environment and Corporations world . <\s>
<s> If someone told me that it 's better to have broad knowoledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject I would say he is right . <\s>
<s> If you choose to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects you have the possibility to choose better in future in which subject you want to specialize . <\s>
<s> In addition you can decide which kind of job you will do in a better way , because if you 're not specialized in one specific subject you can count on your broad skills to do various jobs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides you do n't need to spend a lot of time on the same subject , and it 's for me an advantage because studying the same subject for many years could be quite boring if you realize that you do n't like that subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand if you like the subject you have choosen and if you choose to specialize in one specific subject , you have the possibility to study what you like but it can even be possible that you don'like that subject thus you will be frustrated for the choice you 've made . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I 'm a student of management engineering at Politecnico of Milan and i took this choice of academic course just for these reasons . <\s>
<s> Because I know that this course can give me a broad knowledge of academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conslusion I can say that having a broad knowledge is better than having a specialized knowledge because it gives you more possibilies to decide your future , more possibilities to change your future and because this choice gives you the possibility to be more happy of what you 've choosen . <\s>
<s> Young peoples are majorly useful to build a nation . <\s>
<s> They play a vital role in economic development . <\s>
<s> They have to build communities to help the nation . <\s>
<s> Unfotunately , they are not showing interest to participate in a community . <\s>
<s> They dont have time to help their own communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Community means that discussing their views in one place . <\s>
<s> This could be developed through the internet or by the clubs . <\s>
<s> Here they will communicate with their colleagues and freinds . <\s>
<s> When there is more discussion there will be more development . <\s>
<s> The discussion should be healthy . <\s>
<s> In communities people exchanges their views . <\s>
<s> They wil gain more knowledge with in a time . <\s>
<s> But unfortunately they are spending their time to help their communities . <\s>
<s> This is loss to a nation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , a computer engineer have time to help their community but they are wasting their time in consumig liquor , parties , and sleeping . <\s>
<s> This situation ocurs because of working overtime . <\s>
<s> They have lots of work to do , lots of competition and new tasks to be done . <\s>
<s> They can spare half an hour to help their communities . <\s>
<s> They are not caring it . <\s>
<s> Every one has become selfish . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example is in the case of a doctor . <\s>
<s> doctors are gained mainly through their communities . <\s>
<s> Even they have more to work but they should spend some time in helping their community . <\s>
<s> They have become busy in their work . <\s>
<s> They are taking more rest . <\s>
<s> If this is the case nation have to face severe problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young poeple should be made help their communities . <\s>
<s> It is the respnsibility of the government to encourage them . <\s>
<s> They can encourage through news papers , advertisements and movies . <\s>
<s> They should be told the advantages in helping their community . <\s>
<s> Ofcourse they are inspired quickly and positively . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In coclusion , young people have to spend time to help their communities . <\s>
<s> If this is not the case they will loose communication which may effects the nations economy growth . <\s>
<s> They have to realise in the importance of helping their community . <\s>
<s> Most of the people believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better . <\s>
<s> They think that whether they know everyhing about a subject or not is n't important . <\s>
<s> In contrast to these , I believe that specializing in one specific subject is better than having knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I always give importance to complete a job that I work on . <\s>
<s> It is n't enough for me to do only some part of it . <\s>
<s> I think , for getting a success it is very important to complete the job . <\s>
<s> Eveybody wants to have broad knowledge but there is an important point , do you specialize on it or do you know only a part of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In daily life , there is lots of people who are trying to talk about a subject whether they have a knowledge about it or not . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree with it . <\s>
<s> If I do n't have a knowledge about a subject , I wo n't talk on it , I will only listen people to get their ideas and learn something about this subjects . <\s>
<s> If I want to specialize in this subject , I begin to research about it . <\s>
<s> And for days I study on it for having the true knowledge . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , I always try to add knowledge to my knowledge day by day dy . <\s>
<s> Because I know that for getting a success , a person should be adaptable to changes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do n't forget a discussion about this situation with my best friend . <\s>
<s> We are talking about tennis . <\s>
<s> I have been playing tennis since 1991 . <\s>
<s> I know every detail about tennis . <\s>
<s> However , my friend never plays tennis . <\s>
<s> She asked me a question about a racket and I g'ce information about her question but she said she know better than me . <\s>
<s> And she began to give wrong information to my friens . <\s>
<s> And after this experince , I decide not to talk on a subject that I do n't know or only know a part of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conlusion , I always think that foir getting success it is not better to have broad knowlede than specialize <\s>
<s> I desagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I have several reasons why I think so . <\s>
<s> First , travel lad by a tour guide is titely scheduled so you are not allowed to spend time freely . <\s>
<s> As a result of it , you can not experience the real life of the people who live in the place you visit . <\s>
<s> Tour guides show you only what they want you to see . <\s>
<s> There are many other places you should visit to understand local peoples life . <\s>
<s> For example , the houses they actually live or parks local children gather in , not the places such as famous temples or historic buildings . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , it is better to travel alone than being in a group . <\s>
<s> To travel with your friends may make you feel relaxed , but , especially in the case of going abroad , you can learn how to deal with troubles by yourself . <\s>
<s> It will make you tough and much more self-confident . <\s>
<s> It is true that traveling in a group led by a tour guide banefit you much in terms of seculty and safety , but one of the most important things you can learn from traveling is to acquire the ability to handle the problem even if you are in a strange place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , traveling in a group led by aguid tour is passive . <\s>
<s> If you go abroad , it is bettter to study the language that local people speak . <\s>
<s> Language can not be separated from calture so in you would really like to understand its culture , you need to learn their language too . <\s>
<s> I feel certain that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I consider having knowledges of various subjects could be a valuable advantage for general culture . <\s>
<s> I really think that is important to be polyvalent and to be interested in different subjects . <\s>
<s> However , you should be aware that all informations are not right . <\s>
<s> Consequently you should n't be lost in a ' `` vast ocean of information '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , you are not limited , that means you are able to talk with different persons about various subjects whereas a person who is specialized in one specific subject are not . <\s>
<s> When you are speaking with friends for insance , you can take part at the conversation and express your opinion about the topic since you have studied several points about it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In a nutshell , although being specialized in one particular subject do seem to offer certain advantages like depthy knowleges , they are outweighed by the advantages of acquiring knowlege of several topics . <\s>
<s> Some people believe that successful people shoud try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s> Others believe that successful people shoud only do what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> However , I believe that people should only do what they already know how to do well rather than trying new things and taking risks . <\s>
<s> I have two convincing reasons . <\s>
<s> They can save time and money by doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , we can save time . <\s>
<s> If people want to try new things , they have to do error and trial to establish new things . <\s>
<s> It takes time to establish new things . <\s>
<s> If I want to establish new physics theory , I have to spend a lot of time to think about the theory , probably I have to spend my whole life . <\s>
<s> In contrast , If they only do what they know how to do well , they do not need to spend so much time . <\s>
<s> In the case of physics , they just need to remember physical laws which alreadly known . <\s>
<s> Thus , we can save time by doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , we can save money . <\s>
<s> If people want to try new tnings , they have to take risks . <\s>
<s> Often they lose money because they fail to try new things . <\s>
<s> Many people want to have their own company . <\s>
<s> However , they do not because they want to avoid risks . <\s>
<s> For example , if I have enough knowledge about car technology and want to have new company to make cars , I have to invest enormous money . <\s>
<s> In addition , I have to compete other car companies like GM , Ford and Toyota which have far more money than I. Thus , my car company will bunkrupt easily . <\s>
<s> Then I will lost money . <\s>
<s> Therefore , if people want to success , they should do what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> They cannot expect to earn more money than they expect , but they can earn money as they expect . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I believe that people should only do what they are alreay know how to do well rather than trying new things and taking risks . <\s>
<s> I have two convincing reasons . <\s>
<s> They can save time and money by doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I think that broad knowledge of academic subjects is ever a good thing for a student . <\s>
<s> At first because in this way he can know different aeras of the human knowledge and he can also decide to insight one of that subject that is not extremely similar to his effective academic pathway or even radically change his pathway at all . <\s>
<s> At second because only earlier in his life , a person has the skill and brain resources for achieve a lot of information of every kind of subject , that may have utility in his future or simply serve to increase his culture and his knowledge in humanistic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion is important , for example , for a student that choosed a scientific pathway or studies a lot of scientific subjects , to cultivate any interest in humanistic subjects like literature , philosophy , art etc. because in this way he can achieve a different point of view of the things that sourrounding him and even of this life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that have a broad knowledege is important for personal formation even spirit formation but , at the same time i think that if anyone decide to specialize in one specific subject he can really excel in that subject and become a true expert of his favourite subject , so specializing is important for professional formation . <\s>
<s> Young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities , i agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> I feel Young people nowadays have no time to spend in helping communities there are given work by the college and schools after that they have to work for their pocket money . <\s>
<s> However young people have several interests in pratcipating in these kind of activities but have now time . <\s>
<s> I feel that school and colleges must provide some kind of helping communities during the period of college . <\s>
<s> If the colleges would provide this kind of facility students can easly parcipate . <\s>
<s> Young people are busy with homeworks given by their institutions they always think helping communities , after they finsihed their work they feel tried feel to rest . <\s>
<s> Their is no enough time to spend in these activities . <\s>
<s> Every young person have to think about they should help communities whatever they can do . <\s>
<s> Nowadays its totaly a busy life now one is showing such an interest towards these activities , but some have the tendency to do it but they do n't have the time . <\s>
<s> The government should think about it because young people are those who will change the future of the city so they have to give order to the institutions of helping the communities . <\s>
<s> I have attend the society welfare association at my place and i partcipated in social welfare activities . <\s>
<s> Its not complusory for every young people to help their communities , it 's their interest in it . <\s>
<s> Most young people intend to do it . <\s>
<s> For a better community every person should feel the responsibilty in helping . <\s>
<s> Communities bring a great development in the enivronment . <\s>
<s> In a community their are resources to develop it , but no one is help it . <\s>
<s> My community was is a well structured and desgined because every one help our community and most of them where young people . <\s>
<s> Now our community has stadiums , parks and several other places . <\s>
<s> And our place is well attracted by others due to cleanginess and beautiful site senes . <\s>
<s> Young people are who can change every thing not a community and even a city . <\s>
<s> I fully disagree with this sentence . <\s>
<s> Some people say that it is more useful to have bread knowledge of many academic than to on specific subject . <\s>
<s> they argue that by two reason ; these days , much informations are more valuable than any other things and It is more useful if you find job . <\s>
<s> I , however , have convincing evidence to the contrary . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , some people argue that much informations are most valuable . <\s>
<s> However they do not see why their argument is far-fetched . <\s>
<s> Actually , information is very important to anybody . <\s>
<s> Also many medias provide various information ; like Internet , TV news , and so on . <\s>
<s> So we can get a much information by medias . <\s>
<s> But they do not provide always true . <\s>
<s> If you get wrong informatin , you could get disadvantage . <\s>
<s> So many companys and people effort to find currect information . <\s>
<s> Therefore Their argument which much informations are most valuable , does not stand to reason . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , some people claim that if you find a job , broad knowledge is more helpful . <\s>
<s> However this is not always true . <\s>
<s> Actually , thease days , many company reguire knowledge of specific subject when they employ person . <\s>
<s> If you have knowledge of specific subject , you will easier find a job . <\s>
<s> Actually , many companis emphasis that when they introduce their company in university or other places . <\s>
<s> Hence , their claim , which is broad knowledge is more helpful , has no persuasion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , with unswerving conviction , I firmly disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic . <\s>
<s> All in all , I strongly believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> It is more helpful anybody . <\s>
<s> In university I am often confronted with this kind of question from my friends or other students . <\s>
<s> Of cource both , a broad knowledge of several academic subjekts and a special knowledge on one subject are important . <\s>
<s> In my opinion one has to find the right balance between these to options . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the one hand , it is more important to have a broad knowledge of many different subtjects in early stage of studying . <\s>
<s> I try to illustrate this on an example . <\s>
<s> I am studying geography . <\s>
<s> This main field consists of many different fileds such as geomorpholgie or climateologie . <\s>
<s> When you start studying geographie you even do not know about the existence of these fields . <\s>
<s> This is the reason why you first have to get known all the different parts and fields of geography . <\s>
<s> You first have to find your field of interest On the other hand it is really important to specialize on one specific subject when you achieved a certain amount of broad knowledge in the second part of your studying . <\s>
<s> After you finished university you have to find a job . <\s>
<s> Therefore it is essential that you are specialized in on certain field . <\s>
<s> Companies do not nead people who just have got a broad education . <\s>
<s> To come back to my example of geography , the special subject of geography `` geogaphic information systems '' is a really uprising field . <\s>
<s> Persons who specialice in this field will have it easy to find a job when they leave university . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I think the right answer to this question depends on the point of time . <\s>
<s> First of all you have to reach a certain amount of broad knowledge such as given in the Bachelors degree . <\s>
<s> Later on , it is important to specialize in your field of interest such as given in a Maters programm . <\s>
<s> BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY SUBJECT IN COMPARISION TO ONE SPECIALIZATION ON ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is a famous saying that `` knowledge once gained is gained forever '' . <\s>
<s> Academics play a important role in one life it prepares a base for a person to reach a highest point of attainment of knowledge , but as with just a mere knowledge about anything we cant get the successs so therefore specialization is needed . <\s>
<s> Today world is greatly moving forward going for new advances in every aspect of life either it may be in terms of health , engineering , agriculture , pharmacy , commerece , management etc or any field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every day advances are coming in every field , this change in society can be through change in field of research and technology . <\s>
<s> The scientist , engineers who are experimenting new techniques is through specialization in one single stream . <\s>
<s> if a persons do not get specialised in `` it would be like jack of all and masters of none '' , but this it is also important that a person can lead to final assesment through collecting all the evidences for every single conclusion a approach to other field is also desirable so basic knowledge of other subject is very necessary to reach the result . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Knowledge is a process of continous learning , it requires lot os skill to learn knowlegde same as during schooling it is necessary to study all subjects as it interact us with worldly important things and later on when we move to subjects of our choice we move to particular stream we gain knowledge about every basic aspect about it later on we reach to specialised subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The concept is same as child when he comes to this world he needs to take small steps first to learn to run in future . <\s>
<s> So at the end i would i like to say thatbroad knowledge of many academic subject is essential but to reach a hard core research or invention specialisation is compulsory . <\s>
<s> I desagree with this statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The cars are one of the most creative inventions of the human being that have contributed with the tranportation . <\s>
<s> The invention of the car comes from a long time ago when someone discovered this new way of transporation that would change their lives forever . <\s>
<s> And since then the human being has been trying to improve the car in all of its aspects . <\s>
<s> Growing like a trained dog , following every step that the humanity take , satisfying their transportation needs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now cars are maybe the most succesfull way of transportation and people is not still satisfied with the last innovations of this cars , in fact they want more , they want better cars that can be able to satisfy their personal demands . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So now year with year there is more people born , people that then grow and develop new ideolgies and new demands for the car designers . <\s>
<s> So with the time passing by , and the technology improving day by day future car designs are gonna be maybe 100 hundred times more succesfull than they are nowadays and still , people will be looking for new innovations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In twenty years the scientists and car designers could be able to get these cars to the sky , and just imagine how many demands for this new cars are going to be made . <\s>
<s> I 'm sure that some day there is not gonna be more space for this cars but I am also pretty sure that people are not gonna care for this , instead they are going to develop new ways to store them but never get rid of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that the cars have left a very big footprint in the heart of the humanity and its going to take a while for it to disappear . <\s>
<s> They are gonna be used for a long time . <\s>
<s> Success is a word that brings the glance in people 's eyes . <\s>
<s> I might say that alomost every person in our system tries to get successful . <\s>
<s> In the end success shows the ability to stand up for something or against something and earn the `` applause '' , what mostly appears in money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One one hand there are people who understand the word `` success '' in a collective luck . <\s>
<s> Many of these people help other people to get to know the word success . <\s>
<s> Imagine a kid in today 's Africa . <\s>
<s> Probaly he just tries to survive the night . <\s>
<s> And in this point people see their on sucess , in helping others to live on and get to know what success could mean . <\s>
<s> No doubt , it is one of our major problem we have to solve . <\s>
<s> We must help the people in Africa to show them there is an other life than starvation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand we have people that understand success only for their own benefit . <\s>
<s> They do things , taking risk just to have their own soul in a good mood . <\s>
<s> And no matter what , they going to try as hard as they can to achive their goals even if they take other peoples chances and luck . <\s>
<s> Let 's say , that today 's `` bad guy '' are these guys . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Personally , I think , someone who wants to be successful must have a little bit of both sides . <\s>
<s> I just can relate from myself . <\s>
<s> As a former Tennis Professional I was - and maybe still am - an egoist . <\s>
<s> Starting with tennis I had no choice but to focus on myself and win against my oponent . <\s>
<s> There is no help from a team mate or a coach during the matches , it is only you . <\s>
<s> This fact made me somehow an egoist . <\s>
<s> But it does not mean that I have not learn to think about the others around me . <\s>
<s> I trz hard to do both ways . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I had to take risk to achive my goals even if everybody around was laughing at me . <\s>
<s> On that way , I fully agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Because floating with the mass is not a way to achieve something . <\s>
<s> Fighting against the mass is the way to become successful . <\s>
<s> Most people are successful if they to something special , somthing noone has done before . <\s>
<s> If everybody does the same it is hard to outreach the mass , because so many are doing exact the same thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , the only way to be successful is , to take risk . <\s>
<s> Movement or rather transport is an esential part of day to day activity . <\s>
<s> Cars are included in one of the many means of road transport . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Coming to the topic proper , i DISAGREE with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the near future to come . <\s>
<s> There are many reasons as to why i support my decision . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the technology is advancing in leaps and bounds . <\s>
<s> So , in the near future , cars would be available at a cheaper rate to the commom people . <\s>
<s> The advancing technology would also help in combating the problem of air pollution by devoloping cars that run on electricity or hydro power . <\s>
<s> The science can also be used to produce more fuel efficient cars which would inturn help in conserving our limited natural resources . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The present world is becoming more developed and the basic attitude of a developed society is to maintain good status . <\s>
<s> Cars indicate the status of a person financially . <\s>
<s> Thus more and more people would be inclined to buy cars in the near future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Coming to the most important factor , `` The safety factor '' . <\s>
<s> Travelling in a car is far more safer than travelling on bike . <\s>
<s> This fact has been recently prooved . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but not the least , when it comes to individual concerns , luxury takes the upper hand . <\s>
<s> Cars are far more luxurios than other conventional vehicles . <\s>
<s> For example , one would prefer to travel in a car with the AC on , rather than travelling on a bike under the scorching heat of the sun . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ruling out some facts that cars are robust , and things like that i conclude my topic by saying authentically that there will be more cars in the near future to come . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree that the best way to tavel is in a group , specially a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> There are some reasons why . <\s>
<s> Firstly , tour guide prepare the schedule about travel . <\s>
<s> They do this regardless personal preference . <\s>
<s> So we cannot satisfied about their schedule about travel , because the travel is our travel , not their . <\s>
<s> As a result , a costomer may complain about their schedule . <\s>
<s> So I preper travelling alone scheduled by myself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , travel in group led by a tour does not provide personal time for us . <\s>
<s> A tour prepared schedule whole travel time in advance , so they shoud punctuate the time . <\s>
<s> As do that , they complish their responsibility . <\s>
<s> As a result , we are very busy to obey that time , and we cannot have enogh time to enjoy in one place that we are very interested specially . <\s>
<s> So we cannot appreciate a place or landscape . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I 'm sure that person each other must be having the thought of preference . <\s>
<s> They 'll be unsatisfied about this schedule . <\s>
<s> Thirdly , there are many people in a group , so I cannot have my time . <\s>
<s> In my case , I like to picture the sight , enjoy and think about the place , and meditate alone and silently . <\s>
<s> But , in a group , there are noise about conversation and voice of tour guide , so I cannot concentrate to my notion . <\s>
<s> I disagree with this statement because there are a lot of way to travel . <\s>
<s> You can travel alone or with a gruop , with a guide or without guide , all of these depend of the motivations of your trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think the best way to travel will depend of the motivations of your trip . <\s>
<s> Maybe if you want to expend so time quitely to relax yourself or maybe to meditate , you will prefer travel alone without guide . <\s>
<s> The motivations in that kind of trip is only relax and have a good time . <\s>
<s> Some people need these time , in this rush society where all the things pass very fast . <\s>
<s> Some poeple need space to enjoy and have time to theirselves . <\s>
<s> For these reason I believe if you decide have your time the best way to travel is alone . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But in other way is you want enjoy and take a trip for education reason you will choose go with a group and guide . <\s>
<s> The guide will give direction and inform you about the places you will go . <\s>
<s> In this ocasion I think the best way to travel is in group because in the group you can share ideas , information and you can learn in social enviroment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other example that ilustrate my point is this : supose two men decided make a trip for El Yunque ( forest in Puerto Rico ) . <\s>
<s> The motivations of the first person is have a good time with friends and explore all the forest , but hte motivation of the second person is pass a good time reading in the high of the mountain . <\s>
<s> The first person will agree that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , but the second person will agree that the best way to travel is been alone , without guide . <\s>
<s> For me this example ilustrated my point . <\s>
<s> This statement depend directly for the motivations or the intentions of the trip . <\s>
<s> I could n't decided until I can figurate why I want make this trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Perhaps I decided that the decision depend of your motivations , most of the time I choose travel in group and in my experience a enjoy a lot when I travel in group . <\s>
<s> For me is great go with my friends to other contries to explore . <\s>
<s> This is my experience but in conclusion I agree with this statemen : `` The best way to travel is travel that are accomplish with your motivations '' . <\s>
<s> Well I strongly agree that for students it is more important to understand ideas and the concepts rather than learning only the Facts . <\s>
<s> Firstly , In our daily life , we come across many situations from which we are able to gain knowledge , and thus we learn the concepts and idea from that particular situation . <\s>
<s> Just take an example of a school . <\s>
<s> I n school every student is suppose to study varieties of topics in various subjects . <\s>
<s> When we go on reading , we understand the concept , what that particular lesson implies , and after understanding that lessen we are able to evaluate our own ideas . <\s>
<s> We can even clearify all the doubts from our professor and then our mind becomes more clear and we are able to expand our ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But if we just learns just the facts , without even bothering about its concepts , meaning , then how can we develop idea ? <\s>
<s> Secondly , Nowdays , every work whether its business work , school work , or college work etc , everywork requires us to understand the concept of work , why is it to be completed , what is the advantage of such and so on . <\s>
<s> Then only a person is capable of developing ideas and putting them in use . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Computer now have become the weapon for every work . <\s>
<s> Where ever we see , we find people are operating on computer to carry loads of their work . <\s>
<s> One cannot understand the facts of using such instrument , if he first does not understand the idea of such neither the concept of using that instrument will be clear . <\s>
<s> Only educated . , well advanced in knowledge , whose all concepts are clear can continue working on the computer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , In business , a person should be kept in mind the idea of developing a business . <\s>
<s> A successful person is the only one who understands the idea and concept of building up the business . <\s>
<s> He has to keep up the records uptodate , transactions have to be regularly checked out , profits and the losses have to be viewed , and so on , after understanding all these concepts of business only , a person can set up his business well otherwise he have to bear losses . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally . <\s>
<s> students need to understand the IDEA of a CONCEPT , then only he can learn the FACTS for variety of topics in day to day life , not only in studies but must understand the importance oh their lives , as Life teaches them to experience many things , and from there they should learn the ideas , because a person learns more from experiences ... <\s>
<s> When we look from the past to nowadays , we would discover a lot of successful people . <\s>
<s> These people had mostly pay a lot of time trying new stuffs and experienced new things , and that is why these people can succeed . <\s>
<s> Therefore , a lot of time , it is true that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather than onlly doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well often succed . <\s>
<s> These people often work really hard to find new stuffs and new ideas . <\s>
<s> People who wants to succeed oftne need to take risks in order to succeed . <\s>
<s> Although they might not end up liveing with good respects or beliefs from other people , their successes are undoubtable . <\s>
<s> For instance , one of the famous scientist who had exclaimed that earth is round ended up by putting in to jail for a while , but his successful career is now no doubt that his theory was right . <\s>
<s> Therefore , people who are able to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know what to do well often succeed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , people who do not try new things and take risks but only doing what they already know how to do well do not often succeed . <\s>
<s> If a person do not try new things and discover new things , one would only be a professional in one 's field . <\s>
<s> Meanwhile , that person would be a really tiny chance to find new things like those who succeed . <\s>
<s> For example , if a smart student is good at science but he does not try to find any new thing in science , he might only be a good teacher or professor in his field , but instead of being a successful people who find new things . <\s>
<s> Hence , it is clear that people who do not try new things and take risks would probably end up being profession but not succeed in finding new stuff . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people often try new things and take risks to accomplish their goal rather than doing what they know how to do well . <\s>
<s> We should learn good characteristics from these successful people , and trying to do our best . <\s>
<s> Hopefully , one day we would become those successful people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I believe that successful people are successful because thay have taken risk in their lifes , however some people could argue that a successful life stands on what you think is being success for you . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It probably depens on the way you have been educated . <\s>
<s> Some people find their success in doing what they are doing good . <\s>
<s> Others are always trying to go a step forward . <\s>
<s> The unexplored part of going a step forward has a strong risk that people has to take only if they want to . <\s>
<s> And this is what I believe make us being different or at least , not being as everyone elses . <\s>
<s> Successful is related with being strange , in a unique way , to stand out of the rest of the people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I think it is totally related to you own culture . <\s>
<s> Being successful in the United States is not the same of being successful in China or a small town in Africa . <\s>
<s> My personal experience travelling aroung the world has given me a different idea of what is means to be successful in life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Usually , I relate the success with my own culture and place it in what we call the first world , which means being successful in bussiness enviroment or economy talking . <\s>
<s> However I think it is neccessary to take a step back and think of other cultures : being successful could mean be the leader of a small town in India were it is related to the one how was able to do something ( for example bring water to a village from a long_distance river or to be able to kill a lyon in the middle of a forest ) . <\s>
<s> In all those cases people needed to take risks , but risks that had a meaning on their culture and circumstances . <\s>
<s> In this sense only people how is brave enough to take the risk have the chance of being different can be successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I definitely agree with the statement , and actually I believe that people is successful becasue those risk they have taken , have given them their success . <\s>
<s> Everyone learns a lot of facts in life . <\s>
<s> The humans learn the whole life and are always improving ways to get a larger knowledge . <\s>
<s> While studing everyone should decide about the level of deepness about a certain academic subject . <\s>
<s> The knowlege could be useful , but a lot of times it happens that it does n't have any purposes in real life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For some academics it is important to learn a huge amount of knowledge and it is easier for them to get an overview of information while making a decision . <\s>
<s> These people need jobs with the task like combining different aspects for a certain problem . <\s>
<s> For instance , a manager who has to check out all kind of consequences for a problem . <\s>
<s> A basis for thst is to have a broad knowledge for finding the best solution for the problem . <\s>
<s> Another example could be a doctor who cares forr general sicknesses . <\s>
<s> He has to know about serveral looks of deseases to offer a quick help in a proper way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Sometimes it is also important to have a specialist on a certain subject who is able to solve the problem faster than someone who has just an general idea of the subject . <\s>
<s> For instance , a doctor in a hospital which is specialisted on cancer . <\s>
<s> He would be able to help with a professional look at some cells without reading in a book first or fulfilling some experiments . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Both ways of studing are goog ways to find a profession , because in reality either way is nessecary . <\s>
<s> It depends on the subject and the profession . <\s>
<s> For me it would be more interesting to have a large amout of knowledge and to get in touch with different fields of academic subjects . <\s>
<s> To combine different ideas , aspects and theories sounds very motivating . <\s>
<s> For sure , with a broad knowledge you could never be a specialist , but you are better in finding a solution by attracting more than one circumstance . <\s>
<s> Life is all about the preferences . <\s>
<s> some people choose go on the was x while the other walks on the y so the perefences are depends on the way people want to walk away . <\s>
<s> this rule is also valuable for the academic life of people . <\s>
<s> some people prefer to study and to have knowledge about many subjects , in contrast others want to specialize in only one subject . <\s>
<s> I do not agree with the idea that it is better to have a wide knowledge of many academic subjects than to specilize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , for example , in my university eligible students are given an opportunity to study double majors and many eligible students from business administration department are stuying double in economics as well although most of them is goin to work as a manager in diffrent departments of a company . <\s>
<s> However , in the business field employers require their employees to know pretty much about what they do in the business , for instance a marketing manager is not required to know about economics . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , it is waste of time because instead spending time to get knowledge about many different academic fields people should devote all their time and get depth into the most crucial subject for their future and careers . <\s>
<s> having a little bit knowledge about many academic subjects does not add so much value on the people s career , on the other hand specializing in a single subject can help a person to be famous all around the world just because of the contrubutions s/he makes to this subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conlusion , i believe that focusing on one specific subject is better than to have broad knowledgeof many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> although i have been studying double majors , i have been trying to focus only on and paying more attention to economy classes that i have been attending in the univesity because i want to have an academic career on economics and want to be a famous economics professor all around the world . <\s>
<s> It is more important for students ro understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the students can get more experiences and learn to study independently from understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students can get more ex [ eriences while they are understanding the ideas . <\s>
<s> To understand the ideas , they have to look for more informations of the ideas by finding in the libaries , searching on the internet , and also getting helps from the others . <\s>
<s> While the students are doing that , they get more experiences and know what to do next time . <\s>
<s> they will have more confidents while dealing with the similar problems next time because they have solved the problems before and they know how to solve it . <\s>
<s> Also , they improved their skills in communicate with others . <\s>
<s> When they are asking for helps from others , they will become braver . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Student can learn to study independently from understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> When students learn facts , they get the facts directly from the teachers and they do not need to think , they donot need to find out why it is happened and how it will be . <\s>
<s> While the students try to understand the ideas , they are trying to figure out everything about the ideas . <\s>
<s> They are not simply to remember but to find out why by themselves . <\s>
<s> After they figure out every thing about the ideas , they will increase their confidence and the feeling of satisfied . <\s>
<s> Because of the knowleages and skills they learned from the ideas , they will be more willing to learn the ideas by themselves next time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To understand ideas and concept is more important than learning the facts . <\s>
<s> To understand ideas and concept let students get more experiences and can learn the ideas independently . <\s>
<s> They are more skillful and confident by figure out the ideas by themselves . <\s>
<s> In the last years the number of the families that have more than one car is increased a lot . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless i think that in twenty years will be fewer cars in use . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of reasons to explain this thing Firstly now we have too many cars per family , in fact every family has 2 or , sometimes , 3 cars . <\s>
<s> In fact you need a lot of money to use your car every day . <\s>
<s> The reason is that the petrol is nearly to finish and its cost is becoming higher every day . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly there is a very big problem about using cars : the pollution . <\s>
<s> In fact we are destroing our planet with the smog and if we want to save green areas we have to respect nature and animals . <\s>
<s> For instance many countryes are trying to say that we have to walk sometimes and to use bycicles and pubblic transports . <\s>
<s> However i think that , now , we are to lazy and that we do n't want to find another manner to go to work or to travel . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless i think that in a few years we will be obligated to change our manner to travel and that we will understand the importance of the natural environment . <\s>
<s> For example i am 24 but i do n't have a care and i do n't care about it bacause i like to walk and to use buses a <\s>
<s> In this world , every one needs higher education to make the dream come true . <\s>
<s> It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because it is good for him or her self , their education , and their dreams . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts when they are young because after they grow up , it is hard to learn new things . <\s>
<s> If he or her under stand ideas and concepts , it will help them a lot and they will proud of them self and they feel fun to study because they can answer the questions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not only it is good for him or her self but it is good for their education also . <\s>
<s> After they think it is fun to study when they are young , they will love the school because they wants to know new things and they wants to be able to answer the questions . <\s>
<s> If they love going to school , they get high education . <\s>
<s> Not only they are proud of them selves , but everyone proud of them if they went to go to high education college . <\s>
<s> If they went to good college it will help their life alot and it will change the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , if they have high education , they can probably get the job they are dreaming . <\s>
<s> They can make their dream come true and also , they can get high payments . <\s>
<s> Everyone needs money and it is good to have it than does not have it . <\s>
<s> After they have high payments , they can give their childrent high education also . <\s>
<s> It is good to know things than does not know it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because it is good for him or herself , their education , and their dreams . <\s>
<s> They can make their dream come true if they have high education . <\s>
<s> Everyone want to make the dream come true . <\s>
<s> People usually say that young people are the future of our socieies . <\s>
<s> It is because they have much more time to think about their rest of lives and their futures . <\s>
<s> In addition they have a lot of opportunities to learn and try what they want . <\s>
<s> Moreover , young people are usually very healthy to do something hard thing that they face on . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more that older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , older people have less time to consider and already experienced many things that can enjoy their lives . <\s>
<s> Young people are literally ` young ' , so they have lots of time to think about their lives . <\s>
<s> Also they have much more opportunities to learn and try what they want than order people . <\s>
<s> For example , young people have a lot of dreams in their futures , so they are always consider what they really want to be . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they spend a lot of time to learn new things that they have never experienced , but older people already experienced most of things in their lives so not a lot of things are left for them . <\s>
<s> In addtion , young people have enthusiasm to try new and hard things which can definitly enjoy their lives . <\s>
<s> Although things are hard and difficult have have youth passion to figure out but old people are not really facinated in difficult and dangerous fields . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , older people are not often healtier than young people . <\s>
<s> For instance , older people can not run as fast as young people . <\s>
<s> Therefore , although older people want to hike Rocky Mountain , they can afford to hike as much as they want . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , young people are very healthy to try whatever they want , even though things are very difficult and dangerous . <\s>
<s> In addition , although they get injured , their bodies are easily get better than older people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , young people have much more time to enjoy their lives such as thinking about their future , learning new skills and experiencing new things . <\s>
<s> Moreover they are heathy to enjoy these new experiences and skills than older people . <\s>
<s> Therefore , young people enjoy their lives more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Cars that are flying <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The amount of cars gets enhanced in the last few decades , but as all humanity passed behind so many other things like horses , the last days of cars are coming soon ? <\s>
<s> There are several aspects to talk about this clearly , such as the oil reserves , high technology devices , and public transportation . <\s>
<s> Those are going to be the deciders of the final days of cars or let s say the significant decrease of the amount of the cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As we all know , the oil reserves of the earth is getting lowever and lower each day . <\s>
<s> Scientist , politicians , socialist and so on , think of an alternative resource to oil . <\s>
<s> The only possible solution to this problem is the solar source nowadays . <\s>
<s> It includes the technology that the car engine structure can be based on this enegry , but I do not hink so , because the technology is so expensive to apply and also not progressing fast . <\s>
<s> It won t cause any decrease in car number but in old fashioned cars maybe . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the high technology devices that enables any thing possible , are not quite working on this process , and generating any development to fit in this area would take at least 50 years to give reproducible results . <\s>
<s> The new and high technology always cost very much and it can not be spread so quickly to remove cars from earth . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At last , the public transportation can be good example of an expectation to decrease in car amount in a few decades however , as the world gets bigger in terms of economical subjects concerned , the wealthiness of the people is going to increase , in a manner that everybody want to own his or her car . <\s>
<s> In twety year era , no new things seem to be coming . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , as the development is in the nature of the mankind , the new technologic progresses are on the way , just sticking onto our fancy four wheeled cars must be somehow another fancy thing , too . <\s>
<s> However , when the behaviour of people are analyzed , it can be obviously seen that since there are nothing coming newer than cars in twenty years , I am pretty sure that cars are going to dominate the world somehow <\s>
<s> According to me i feel that it is the best thing for a person to have better knowledge about specialized subject rather than seeking knowledge about several subjects for several reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly seeking knowledge about a particular subject can make him a master in that subject . <\s>
<s> He can expertise soley in the subject . <\s>
<s> for example if you are interested in general science . <\s>
<s> You can concentrate on that subject only and know the subject study the subject deeper . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly a person can study the sub jecft and know the deeper strengths and lines of the subject . <\s>
<s> the person can get a chance to know and study more details about the subject . <\s>
<s> In contrast if we concentrate on all subjects we may not achieve perfecton in any of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly there is a saying that a person can do only one thing at one time . <\s>
<s> for example if a person dream is to become a scientist , it is of no use if he concentrate on other subjects such as economics or arts etc . <\s>
<s> Although they are only important for him to have a basic idea about this subjects not any thing thing more because they donot contribute him to reach his target or his destination . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> fourthly a person may get several opportunities in future which may wecome him or her . <\s>
<s> for example if a person attends an interview he or she may be asked that in which subject or area you are specialised , or interested . <\s>
<s> Based on his specilization of subject the interviewer may ask the questions . <\s>
<s> A person gets an opportunity to be an expert or master of his subject being specialised . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up although other academic subjects are also basically important to seek knowledge but it is always a good idea or beneficiary to be an expert in any particular subject . <\s>
<s> It is bette to lspecialize in one rather than mixing of all other subjects . <\s>
<s> A lot of changes have occurred in society in the last few years . <\s>
<s> Some of them have been good and some of them bad . <\s>
<s> An instance of a bad change is that young people nowadays are not giving enough time to help their communities . <\s>
<s> This deviation is due to the change in human perception-of how humans relate to life , to each other and to the society they are part of . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An important reason behind the deviation is that society , in general . <\s>
<s> has become more individualistic . <\s>
<s> This is manifested by people thinking much more about themselves than about their communities . <\s>
<s> An example to illustrate this point is that nowadays people are less enthused by news such as someone from their community winning a sweepstakes . <\s>
<s> Now all most people think of are themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this context , it is also important to note that people have become much more materialistic . <\s>
<s> They are not inclined towards professions or vocations which are not highly paid . <\s>
<s> This is evident in the declining number of people-people who are enthusiastically becoming teachers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another important feature of present life is that the expectations of people have changed . <\s>
<s> People do not see the correlation between their good and their communities . <\s>
<s> These people do not expect to benefit from the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And lastly young people do not believe in the logic that communities have any deman <\s>
<s> Advertisments is what makes the product to be saled . <\s>
<s> When offering a product the best quality of it is shown . <\s>
<s> this marketing technique has boost up a lot of product for not saying most of them . <\s>
<s> We have some cases like shampoos , clothes , and medicines . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , most of the adverstisments company only wants to sell , no matter how , no matter when , but the faster the better , sometimes they exagerate the functions of a product or its qualities , to convince and presuade people to buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the product will eventually work but most of the times not in the way shown in the adverstisment , lets take the case of a no-hair lost shampoo , the advertisment will show a bald man who wants his hair back , so he will use the shampoo for a few days and after minutes in the advertisment you will see a guy with long hair talking about his experience , i really do not beleive that , thats my personal opinion because they say you will se results in a short period , and yes , you will see them but not as much as they say it will . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , advertisments create sometimes a non-real idea of the products , or if they do they will show you real shallow . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , advertisments only work for boosting up a product and convince a costumer . <\s>
<s> It is not a main purpose show what the product really is or how is it going to work or how long does it will take . <\s>
<s> They just want to convince you and persuade you to buy it . <\s>
<s> Thats why i strongly dislike to see advertisments , everything is a big lie , my quote is `` advertisment products do half of what they say and half of what they pomise '' . <\s>
<s> I will totally agree that it is really it is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concepts has led to new inventions in the modern life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> For example Newton 's law of motion which is the basis of physics . <\s>
<s> Newton 's law of motion can only be understood when the person actually understand the logic behind . <\s>
<s> One of his law states that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . <\s>
<s> This concept can only be understood when you do it practically . <\s>
<s> Just by learning the fact does not pays . <\s>
<s> When this concept is used in practical labs , the concepts become more clear . <\s>
<s> The person will never forget these concept throughout his lifetime when implied practically . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another perfect example which tells that understanding ideas and concepts are really important . <\s>
<s> Everyone of us know about , the value of accerlation due to gravity . <\s>
<s> This value was established by Sir Newton . <\s>
<s> Everybody knows that value because it is a learned fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> He found this value while putting his ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> He was sitting under an apple tree . <\s>
<s> The apple fell from the tree and newton started thinking about the speed at which might the apple have felled . <\s>
<s> He conducted many practical experiments which lead to the value . <\s>
<s> Hence it shows how important is to understand ideas and concept . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example will be that of Telesa , one of the best electrical engineers . <\s>
<s> It was his concepts and ideas that developed the principle of Alternating currents . <\s>
<s> Because of this , power can be transmitted to long places . <\s>
<s> So it is really important to have stress on understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end , i think it is really important for the student to give stress on understanding ideas . <\s>
<s> They should put stress on the concepts that developed those facts . <\s>
<s> By stressing on concepts and ideas , new modern technologies will be developed and that will be an advantage for human life . <\s>
<s> In my opinion an individual should posses sufficient knowledge about his key academic subejcts along with possesing excellent skills in his choice of specific subject . <\s>
<s> In this competitive world , one is supposed to have an all rounder personality with a specialization or in other words mastery over that specific subject . <\s>
<s> From my experience , an all rounder person will be able to achieve greater success socially and professionally as he 's sound in all of the related areas of his study but at the same time has sufficient knowledge so as not to fall back on any discussion other than his specialization . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To start discussing about my opinion , lets take the situation when one choses to study all of his key subjects without mastering anyone of those . <\s>
<s> This practice will result him being vulnerable to loose to each opponent who has at least one of these subjects as his specialization , not ignoring the increased possibility that the individual will be able to participate in any event or conversation pertaining to any of his subject areas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another situation to consider will be , when one masters only specific subject without giving considerate attention to his other subjects , will lead him to a situation where he 'll excel in his subject area conversations but at the same time , he 'll not be in a situation to participate in a conversation about any other topic which is not his subject . <\s>
<s> In this situation the individual has greater chances of successding in his area of specialization . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can clearly see that the number of benefits an individual can gain by following either of the two statements will lead to number of disadvantages as well . <\s>
<s> As both of the statements has it 's own set of pros and cons , I would disagree with any of these two statements taken alone . <\s>
<s> However , combining both of the statements would lead to a much more sensible and pragmatic way of advancing in competitive world . <\s>
<s> Being young is the reason of being active for a long time and being active would naturally imply to be in a state to enjoy for a longer time . <\s>
<s> But there are some exceptions where even older people show their activeness for a long time which is in rare situations . <\s>
<s> Young people can easily do the activities which the older people struggle for . <\s>
<s> But even there are some old people who do the things easily . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people usually never dare for the adventures in their life for enjoyment where as most of the young people will not hesitate to go for adventures for enjoyments . <\s>
<s> The old people probabaly will lose the interest of enjoying the life as they would put their interest more on the family matters , careers , future life etc , . <\s>
<s> The young people having the plans for their future will more concentrate on enjoying the part of their lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Watching movies , going to beach , enjoying the beaties of the nature are mostly done by the Young peolpe as it can be clearly seen in any tourist place that most of the visitors will be the younger people . <\s>
<s> Old people lack the interest in doing so because most of them doesnot have the strength to travel for a long time . <\s>
<s> There are also some old people who never think of their pains for enjoyment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Old people usually select the actvities for enjoyment only at the times of some ocassion whereas the Young people will always try to find the reasons for enjoyment . <\s>
<s> There are also old people who leave the responsibilites aside and spend more time in enjoyment of life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence I strongly feel that , its not the matter of age which decides the enjoyment but it is the matter of the attitude of the people towards life . <\s>
<s> Today , travelling has became one of the most important entertainments for people to relax or borden their views . <\s>
<s> Most people do their travelling in a group led by a tour guide , but is that the best way to travel ? <\s>
<s> I will not give not an answer such that either completely yes or no , because this depends on the situations of different types of people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having a tour guide can be benificial . <\s>
<s> First it ensures better on travellers ' safety . <\s>
<s> People such as children and elders should definitely be taken care by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> We can not expect our 10-year-old daughter or 60-year-old grandmother to travel on their own , in this situation they should travel with the help of tour guides . <\s>
<s> Second , most travllers are new to the place they visit and do not have a very good understanding about it , a tour guide therefore will be helpful in introducing the place and making sure the traveller can enjoy at the most extend during the vocation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , there are diavantages of travelling with a tour guide , too . <\s>
<s> What comes first is the lack of freedom , especially when our traveller are young and independent . <\s>
<s> Me as a young and curious woman , for instance would rather travel with my own friends , so that I will not restricted by the guide and have more fun . <\s>
<s> Second , from the aspect of scheduels , plans that tour guides provide may not satisfy people 's desires . <\s>
<s> Different travellers have different tastes and preferences , and as a group there might be conflicts between memebers . <\s>
<s> So when it comes to the matter of freedom and flexibility , travelling with a tour guide will not be a wise decison . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , whether to travel with a tour guid or not does depend on people 's own situations . <\s>
<s> They need to weiht their preferences to decide if a tour guide is helpful or not . <\s>
<s> I believe that the most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , and this can be inferred from different reasons . <\s>
<s> The first of these is that we are living in a very competitive world and this get the people to make bigger some detail more than what they are , to involve the clients to buy the product . <\s>
<s> A tipically example can be found in a lot of good for children , where really little features are presented `` in scale '' , for example the ability for the toy to rise it size or the ability to make strange movements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason could be a legal process . <\s>
<s> The productor are covering himself by legitimating something of the good . <\s>
<s> In first this could be a bed advertisements , but could also explain the particular nature of the object , really fragile , a quality that could be research from the client . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is also an `` internal '' reason if we want to say so . <\s>
<s> The manager want to present is creation to the stakeholders and need to have their approvation to start the production . <\s>
<s> In this case the interest of the productors is directed to the owner of the company , not to the client , but is important too , of course . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The last reason is similar to the first , in this case we can find person who are presenting only the positive points of the products without talking about the negative . <\s>
<s> The mission of this manner is the same but here the people are n't creating anything , they are omissing a part of the complete reality , differently in the first case where the people could also present the negative points because there are a huge amount of positive points which cover them . <\s>
<s> A tipically example of this manner can be found in the most of the new invention where it 's needed a positive consideration to be lunch , like the Titanic in which was n't presented the lack of ships to escape , looking only to the big fashion-style of it . <\s>
<s> Since I 've been student for a long time , I can say that at the age when we are young students ( for example High school age ) , we normally tend to care more to understand ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Anyhow , I have to say that , at least as far as my experience is concerned , along the student age we change our learing process , passing from giving more importance on theory to linking theory to facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example when we talk about students untill high school , I believe that up to that age we already had a lot of concepts from schools , family and social enviroment . <\s>
<s> At this age we do n't care , for example , about political events or international affairs . <\s>
<s> This is due to the fact that certainly we are too young , we are more focused on other things such as having fun , going out , doing some sports . <\s>
<s> What is more , we 're completely unable to link all the concepts we received to real facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , when we go to the university , and this is another step of being students , I think the things change . <\s>
<s> It happens because we 're getting in another enviroment in which we weant to be well considered , we 're meeting other people with who we 're going to share more adult experince and last but not least we 're getting more mature . <\s>
<s> As a result we can link in a more efficient way what we studied ( aslo during the high school ) to the real facts . <\s>
<s> For example it happens to me when I studied the concept of inflaction . <\s>
<s> When I was watching the TV news , I was really surprised to finally understand what inflation is and what are its effects . <\s>
<s> And this is not all . <\s>
<s> We 're also becoming able to link some concepts that we 've learnt in the past to the real facts , and at that time you finally realize how was usefull to study that concept ( that at the beginning it has been considered stupid ) . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , I agree partially that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts that it is to learn facts , because it could depends if we 're considering high school student ( who are more focused in concept and ideas ) and university students ( who are beginning to link the concepts to facts ) . <\s>
<s> Everyday in our lives we can see products ' advertisements and spots almost everywhere we go . <\s>
<s> They are specifically studied to attract us , to steal our attention , thus making us think about them even for few seconds , even if we do n't need what they are advertising . <\s>
<s> To do so they have to be direct , colorful , funny . <\s>
<s> Everything they are advertising must appear beautifull , amazing , of great use or even really tastefull . <\s>
<s> So yes , I basically agree with the statement , and we can often have evidence of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example - a really common one - we see on tv or on a paper something advertising something to eat , it seems wonderfull , hot , tasty and it also has a low price ! <\s>
<s> I have at least to try it . <\s>
<s> When we go to buy it , we can see it is half the size it seemed and it is not even that tasty . <\s>
<s> Advertisements can influence a lot your thoughts . <\s>
<s> Not to talk about kids . <\s>
<s> If they see a toy on tv , it 's shown colorfull and huge . <\s>
<s> They NEED to buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What I said works the best with foods , toys , something uncommon or that we do n't usually see . <\s>
<s> Items used in our everyday life cannot be shown to much better than they are , because we know them , we know how they work and what they can and cannot do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The base idea to advertise something is to make it appear fantastic . <\s>
<s> If you want to sell it it MUST appear fantastic . <\s>
<s> To do so it can seem even better than it is . <\s>
<s> I agree specialize specialize in one subject is better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Introduction : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 1. know the subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 2.opportunities are there . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 3.dont waste time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First reason is if a student to take learning on one subject it will be easy to get the score . <\s>
<s> for example if a student takes the course of like computer subject in this it can have different subjects are there . <\s>
<s> If the student to choose the subject java course . <\s>
<s> The student can concentrate on that subject . <\s>
<s> so he can get the good score . <\s>
<s> Suppose if job is not get he can teach the subject to other students and he can get the salary . <\s>
<s> This is other way doing if he ca n't get the job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second reason is to create new project if the student take on one subject if we take above example java course . <\s>
<s> The student can create new things like if in the based on the java course he can create web sites and quick transactions . <\s>
<s> If a student going this way he can get better opportunities and the student get the better salary and he can bright future . <\s>
<s> If the student can create new project he can give the presentation on that things . <\s>
<s> If the Government to produce in the market and people are used to that project . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third reason is dont waste time the student can learn on that subject he can not the waste the time . <\s>
<s> some students takes different courses so that student can waste the time . <\s>
<s> Those student no relief and happiness . <\s>
<s> because at the time of end course if the student can not get grip on those subject it will be very difficulty . <\s>
<s> if the student on one particular subject he can save the time . <\s>
<s> That time he can spend with friends or families or other activities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So iagree specialize in one subject is better . <\s>
<s> Whether most advertisements make their products seem much better than they really are ? <\s>
<s> Different people have different opinions because of different way of thinking and experiences . <\s>
<s> As for me , it is true that advertisements always exaggerate their products and try their best to attract customers . <\s>
<s> Why do I think so ? <\s>
<s> Because I have my real unhappy experiences . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , you can see the advertisement about shampoo everday . <\s>
<s> In the TV , the femal stars display their beautiful hair proundly and the shining hair is so realistic that everyone believes that he or she can have such beautiful hair as long as he use the product . <\s>
<s> So am I. My hair is brown , not straight and not black enough . <\s>
<s> So I bought one of the product to improve my hair , dreaming oneday to display my beautiful hair to my husband . <\s>
<s> But , the effect was not so obvious as the advertisement announced . <\s>
<s> I was really dispoint and today my hair is still not shinning and brown . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Here is also one real case of my friend 's . <\s>
<s> Everyone wants to be tall and handsome , but my friend is short and she is really upset abouth that . <\s>
<s> Someday , she saw a great advertisement about a new type medical device which can increase your height . <\s>
<s> The advertisement also gave a lot of sucessful cases to confirm people that the medical machine really does work . <\s>
<s> It even promised that customers can take their money back if the device is ineffective . <\s>
<s> My friend was moved by the advertisement , rush out of the door and took one home from the company . <\s>
<s> She put on the device everday just as the explaining manul of the device told her . <\s>
<s> One month past , two month , then half a year , my friend was still short as she was . <\s>
<s> when she decided to return the medical device to the company and took her money back , she found that the company was not exist anymore . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Maybe some people will think that it is just a small percent of advertisements which cheat customers . <\s>
<s> But is there any natural or thorough difference between cheating and exaggeration ? <\s>
<s> Everday there are people such things happen to . <\s>
<s> For example , `` perfect `` computer software make PC collapse tottally , `` unshrink '' fabric make clothes still shrink after washing . <\s>
<s> Obviously , most advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are <\s>
<s> I agree this idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> There are two reasons : relieved and expart of the guide . <\s>
<s> To the beginning , i 'm relieved when a tour guide leads us . <\s>
<s> Because she knows everythingFor example , I travel to a foreign country . <\s>
<s> If I can not communicate in English and not mother language , I worry about it . <\s>
<s> I may not to able to listen guide and not to see the direction . <\s>
<s> Then I may get lost . <\s>
<s> In my case , I traveled in London alone . <\s>
<s> I have a map and book which is written the details about that city . <\s>
<s> I walked around the city while I look the book . <\s>
<s> But I got lost . <\s>
<s> I was so nervous because I could not find that there were no japanese and people who could speak in Japanese . <\s>
<s> Then I thought . <\s>
<s> If I belongs to a tour group by a tour guide , I did n't get lost . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Next and the last , a tour guide is expart of introducing . <\s>
<s> Because She or he know the imformation better than ordinary people . <\s>
<s> For instance , in this case , it is also a foreign country . <\s>
<s> Last summer , I went to Italy in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> This is my first time to visit Italy and also the first time to travel led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I wanted to visit various place , so I often asked a tour guide like this . <\s>
<s> Where should I go in order to eat dinner to cheep restaurant ?? <\s>
<s> or Which place is the best to go to the church ?? <\s>
<s> A tour guide always told me . <\s>
<s> And also she told us the history of the city , country . <\s>
<s> furthermore she showed us the secret place where it is not written in the book . <\s>
<s> I felt it was happy to know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For those reason , I agree this idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I agee with the statment , because the advertizements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Especially , the visual advertisemnts make them better effecitively . <\s>
<s> the products in the picture is the best conditon . <\s>
<s> it means that it is not natural . <\s>
<s> people often are decieved by the advirtisemnts when they purchase the products . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , the cleannig detergents inTV commercial shows how clean they make the floor , table , deshes , and window glasses . <\s>
<s> it is a kind of show , not real . <\s>
<s> when we are wathing the TV shows , we are impressed and amazed . <\s>
<s> And then , we may go to a supermarket to buy the product which is new but it might not be as different as it used to be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example is the menu in the restaurant . <\s>
<s> we can see a lot of foods in the pictures . <\s>
<s> And , we choose the most likely good taste one . <\s>
<s> However , the most of the foods in the menu are not the one which we expected . <\s>
<s> Some of them are suppoused to be disappointed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> we can see many kinds of visual advertisemnts in our lives . <\s>
<s> the advertisement effect us to decide to puchase the products in all of other competiton products , although the most products in the advertisements are better than they are . <\s>
<s> Although I can understand people , who think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , I think that speacializing in one specific subject is better . <\s>
<s> I want to point out my opinion with the following 3 arguments . <\s>
<s> First of all , in ancient time , the greeks and romans needed manz academic skills . <\s>
<s> For example , Aristoteles was a philosophist , mathematic and a astrophologist . <\s>
<s> They needed these many specialisations to earn money . <\s>
<s> But since Henry Ford invented the construction band , the specialisation expanded . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , you have to be a genius to have a broad knowlodge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> For example students need three or four years to study only one academic subject . <\s>
<s> So it would cost the person a lot of time to get a broad knowledge . <\s>
<s> Furthermore studies are not for free . <\s>
<s> The person would also need a lot of money , and this is not very effective , as he or she do n't earn a lot more money , when they start working . <\s>
<s> So in fact , you should study two things side by side . <\s>
<s> But this request a high IQ , which only a few people have . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but not least , as mentioned in the beginning , specialisation is needed today in every work . <\s>
<s> Today companies search for specialised workers in only one specific subject . <\s>
<s> The work does not require other academic subjects . <\s>
<s> So a person with a broad knowledge would propably be annoyed , doing this job . <\s>
<s> So the company will propably prefer the specialised worker . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I study business , this is already a specialisation , but i have to pick out only one part of business . <\s>
<s> For example , controlling or finance management and when I work in a big company I even have to go deeper into specialisation in one aspect of controlling or finance managment . <\s>
<s> And by doing this I have to learn every day new things , so I will never have the time to learn other academic subjects . <\s>
<s> We all know that young people are more energetic and more healther than older people . <\s>
<s> I can feel that in my life experience , my mother stay at home every weekend , I ask her why she do n't go outside , she always give me the answer such as `` No ... <\s>
<s> I feel tired `` or '' No ... <\s>
<s> i 'm not interesting about outside stuff '' . <\s>
<s> Beacuse of these reason I believe that young people can enjoy life and do more activities than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On of the reason is that older people get tired easily , they may even have some problem with their body system . <\s>
<s> In such case , they can not go mountain climbing , go disco with friends , go shopping for 5 hours long . <\s>
<s> They ca n't bear these carzy activities , therefore they will miss some chances to know more about vivd life , And the other reason is that young people , like me , we usually go for a trip with our friends in the spring break or summer vacation , we see or gain more information by this activity , we know more cultures from other country and people , that is older people prabebily ca n't do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe many parents , includ my parent told to their children , participate in more activities and enjoy life when we are still young , because after graduate from university we have to concentrate on our career , try do be a succesful people in the society . <\s>
<s> After age 30 , we focus more on our family ( especially women ) , after 40 we do ore best to earn money yo support family , after 50 we have no energy at all to enjoy our life . <\s>
<s> Well , to see if I disagre or not with being traveling with a tour guide I have to explain first the advantages and the disadvantages . <\s>
<s> Well , let 's begin . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advantages <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can say that primarily there are four advantages to being traveling accompanied by a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 1. They have the experience that they know well the place in which you are traveling , most if it 's a different country or even a different city . <\s>
<s> In case it 's a differente country in which there 's a different language talked , that 's a really benefit . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 2. They know important facts that maybe one will not know in case you do n't know history or do n't understand the language . <\s>
<s> 3. I think , that the primarily advantage of being guid by a tour guide iis that you do n't get lost ! <\s>
<s> It 's normal that if you are visting a city or country for first time you can easily get lost , so , ther 's a great advantage ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 4. A tour guide knows the principal places or the most common , the famous ones . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The disadvantages <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> About the disadvantages , there are also four , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 1. The first one is that you have to pay money ! <\s>
<s> HA ! ... <\s>
<s> maybe you are traveling with exact money and you do n't have enough to pay a tour guide ! <\s>
<s> 2. When you are guided by a tour guide you depend on the fastness he moves , maybe you want stay more time in some places and get out faster in other ones , but it depends on him , the tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 3. Even the tours guide know many places , one can get into service offices and ask for information , you do n't have to depend on others ! <\s>
<s> 4. And one important and final fact is that you can meet a lot of people by your own . <\s>
<s> You can make a lot of friends , know lot of places you really want to visit , not only places all visit , instead many others ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Conclutions <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I prefer traveling maybe with only a friend and between he and me I think it would be a great experience , without wasting and meeting a lot of people . <\s>
<s> I am agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> The reason is that in the twenty years there were not many cars in use as now or because the people could not afford to buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If we look at the history , the twenty years were not many successful for many people . <\s>
<s> For example , in the United States although there was a period of healthy in the early twenties and people could afford to buy cars , at the last years of the century the Depression let many people witouth jobs , houses and withouth even necessary items . <\s>
<s> As well in Europe , as always , there were so many status differences between people that only richs had the opportunity to get cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , today there are a lot of differents models of cars and you can buy a car cheaper that in those years . <\s>
<s> For example , now a little car that allow you to drive along the city costs about 6,000 euros that is a raisonable price . <\s>
<s> Also , nowadays , you have the chance of buying a car and pay for it every month during several years , so even young people having good jobs can afford to drive their own cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides , you have the option of buying a car that have been used before . <\s>
<s> We know that , propably the car will be broken before than a new one but , if you really need it and you do not have enough money to buy a new one , is an option that can be considered . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However if you have money to spend and you really like cars , there are a huge variety of them to buy . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , cars almost can drive by their selves or at least , park . <\s>
<s> This type of cars are from Japan or China and maybe , in not a long time , many people will be able to get these wonderful cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As we can see , today , there are so many options in the market that make possible to everyone to get a car in an economic way , if it is that they want , or to buy a super car spending more money . <\s>
<s> However , I think that in the twenty years get a car was a thing for only rich people and it is for sure that there were not so many options as we have today to choose one , based not only in the price but also in our preferences . <\s>
<s> Debates on wherether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts versus simply learning the facts are very common . <\s>
<s> Comprehending and understanding the concepts and ideas is obvioulsy more important than simply learning the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> there are many reasons why understanding ideas and concepts is more important that learning facts . <\s>
<s> If a student is only memorizing facts they will not understand why the answere or the outcome was what it was . <\s>
<s> The students attend school to gain knowlage not to memorize facts . <\s>
<s> If they are merley learning the facts they are being robber of their education . <\s>
<s> When the student leaves the class they should be able to answere why something happend the way it did not just know that it happened . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , the tools the student recinves by understanting ideas and concepts are much more valuale than the ones he or she will learn by only memorizing facts . <\s>
<s> By understanding concepts the student will be able to apply them to different stituations and come to other conclusions . <\s>
<s> If a student understantds that something happens because of some reason they can answere more questions and know more about the subject that those who only know the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although in most occasion it is easier to learn the facts instead of understanding the concepts in the long run understanding the concepts is more valuable . <\s>
<s> The student that understands the concept will be able to answere more questions on the subject and be over all more knowlegable on the topic . <\s>
<s> The student that simply memorized the facts will eventually forget them and will have gaind nothing at all . <\s>
<s> Since the invention of the first car , their amount has always increased causing a lot of damages to the environment . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , I believe that in twenty years , this worrying tendancy will be decrease . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First at all , it will be very harmfull to the environment if the amount of car tend to increase more and more . <\s>
<s> That is why , in the next years , the government will have to take strict measures to prevent people from using their cars every day . <\s>
<s> There already are some measures such as when the pollution is too high , only certain kind of car are allowed to circulate . <\s>
<s> But , as far as I am concerned , the governement should do more and strenghten the law . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> They can develop public transport and make me them cheaper . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the price of the fuel has strongly increased , and it costs and will cost more money to move by car , even if other energy are developed . <\s>
<s> Much of people cannot afford to pay more and will find more benefits not using their car , but rather public transport . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An other reason makes me believe that the amount of car will decrease . <\s>
<s> Indeed , technological progress are more and more developed and performed quickly . <\s>
<s> In few years , Cars will be replaced by some innovations who enable people to move cheaper , faster and easier . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , even if automobile firms intent to create cheaper and more ecologic cars , I think that news innovation will be created at the expanse of the cars . <\s>
<s> And in twenty years , the supply of cars will have been collapsed , and then the amount of car will have been strongly decreased . <\s>
<s> `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Probably the secret of many successful person might be this only . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If people go on with the well known things they might feel their life bored and they ca n't think innovatively , which leads to miss their success hence the fame or reputation . <\s>
<s> For example a man could not be a scientist unless he try to invent or invent a new thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For instance take the astronomers who would always think of doing something or discovering or analysing something new from the space which an simple man ought to do , make them to do ricks like space travelling . <\s>
<s> Evenif they will fail once they would try besides their lives for new things . <\s>
<s> Which makes them great successful citezens . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I was always encouraged by my father to do new things so that i can give wings to my mind and think beyond and become a sucessfull guy in my society . <\s>
<s> which brought me several prizes by participating in the science fare . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also when people try to do new things they will adopt for that and they will get habituated to those despite of the difficulty . <\s>
<s> Also trying new things would also give some self satisfaction for oneself . <\s>
<s> If we do a new thing and succeeded in it we feel proud for that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It will also be play full to do new things . <\s>
<s> Kids usually have this behaviour that is they would like to mplay alwaya with new toys or others which they like the most for them even candle light would be so attracted that they would like to touch it which may bring rick for them but unknowingly he does it and finds out what would happen uf he touches a harmful things . <\s>
<s> That is trying new things willl make a person to leatn new things which helps him through out hte life Finally i conclude that going for newer thing make man more successfull . <\s>
<s> As success not means only success in acedemics or other but selfsatisfaction is also a type of success which makes us to stand still for any circumstances we face . <\s>
<s> I dis agree that there will be fewer cars used in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> Even though the present fuel for car will not available in the coming future as it is now , but there will not be decrease in using the cars . <\s>
<s> scientists are working to find out the alternate fuel for automobiles than the fuel that we are prestently using in cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> some cars have also came into the market which will run through soalr system i.e using sun light as the main source of energy to the car . <\s>
<s> Research is going on over bio-fuel . <\s>
<s> scientists saying that this fuel will be much more cheap tha the fuel we are using now in the cars since thus fuel is coming from the trees . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are some areas in India where the farmers are growing this tree ( i.e bio-fuel trees ) . <\s>
<s> Designers are playing an important role in car industry . <\s>
<s> Every day Automobile designers are coming with frequent changes in the car design in order to attract the customers . <\s>
<s> They are making sure that a car contain all laxurious items in it . <\s>
<s> like AC , Digital music system , capcatiy of the engine , speed , flexible bumpers , horse power , brake horase power , modifiaction in steering , convient seating ect . <\s>
<s> even the designers are changing the body of the cars and also using modern shiny colours to it which are actually harmful to the environment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The car companies are using media a lot in order to attract the customers . <\s>
<s> They are using eminent personalities like heros , players ect as a brand ambassdor of their company . <\s>
<s> Many Banks are even offering loans at least finance so that every one can have a car in the future . <\s>
<s> According to the topic given above this essay which mainly looks at inspiring people to decide weather taking new risks will rule or satisfied with the work which they already know them how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As one become successful by trying out new things by taking any kind of risks . <\s>
<s> They will be always forward to put lot of efforts in knowing out new things . <\s>
<s> Going out for more inventions rather than sticking to one and been successful in one task only . <\s>
<s> Further more people are appreciated for being successful in all other fields to . <\s>
<s> For example a person who has not only theoritical knowledge on a particular subject but also has practical knowledge . <\s>
<s> So he said to be genious . <\s>
<s> He or she might clicked in both the streams out . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some successful people they try to take risks which they are morely interested on . <\s>
<s> For example few politicians who are successful they always think differently . <\s>
<s> They try to be successful in other fields also . <\s>
<s> A person who is not5 only a farmer but also a business man . <\s>
<s> He always try to expand his business . <\s>
<s> Generally people are meant to be successful as they try to achieve goals in different fields . <\s>
<s> Such as one of my uncle he is a government employe in a reserve bank of india . <\s>
<s> He gained a good name and fame in the society . <\s>
<s> His later idea is to become a real estate developer . <\s>
<s> However he was into that field he still took lot of risk in knowing about the subject which he was not all familar with it . <\s>
<s> He gained a good name in this field also . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my best knowledge a man is successful when he takes up a new job which might be interesting and challeging . <\s>
<s> Trying out in new things also helps to develop knowledge in that particular task and have a perfect grip in other new fields . <\s>
<s> It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Because it can develop the student resolved problems ability , organize ability , and researching ability . <\s>
<s> First , if the students more understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , they can develop their ability of resolve . <\s>
<s> For example , the students are learning history facts . <\s>
<s> They need to know why cause this result , so they can learn how to resolve problems from someone 's experiences . <\s>
<s> It it better understand ideas than to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the students can learn how to organize the facts . <\s>
<s> Becasue as many as facts can conncet , the students depend on the time line to find out more legic truths . <\s>
<s> So through learn the facts that the students can drill their ability of organization . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Final , the students go to school not just to learn facts but also to learn how to do reseaching work . <\s>
<s> For instance , teachers teach students a lot of facts . <\s>
<s> And students need to research the background of the facts . <\s>
<s> So reearching help the students to learn better than just memorise the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On this day , students need to learn how to resolve problems , organize the questions , and doing research working . <\s>
<s> All of abilities can help their future . <\s>
<s> So it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learn facts . <\s>
<s> What is advertisement for ? <\s>
<s> Selling a product . <\s>
<s> Commercial are built for the only purpose of finding clients that will buy a certain product . <\s>
<s> How many common mortals can develop a sense of criticism looking at a well cooked and decorated dish of a new restaurant opening in the neiborhood or resist the temptation of tasting a chocolate mousse cup as soft as you see on the tv spot . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The range of positiveness that an advertisement send to the public is infinite and for the quality of the product and for the contest where you find it . <\s>
<s> Happy families and smiling faces can attract more customers for sure . <\s>
<s> Using design , music and celebrities can contribute to make the rest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is a famous advertisement in The United States about an `` Italian restaurant '' . <\s>
<s> The music in the background is a typical Italian Tarantella , a big family is sitting around a big table speaking loud , smiling and pouring wine . <\s>
<s> The picture looks like a real piece of Italian life . <\s>
<s> Many Americans , with Italian heritage or not , dream of going out for dinner and taste a genuine Italian cuisine spending a moderate price . <\s>
<s> Who design the advertisement , of course , paid a careful attention to all the details . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Well I confess that I was also attracted by the genuine Italian atmosphere created in that advertisement . <\s>
<s> With great disappointment I came back home . <\s>
<s> Nothing was like I expected : frozen food and butter prevailed , instead of the freshness and the olive oil commercialised . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisements are nice and very intertaining , but we always should keep in mind the main reason why they exist and always take them ` cum granum salis ' . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement of the topic and put my views with regard to my opinion as follows . <\s>
<s> Take for example the business sector , most of the successful people in are not merely to one sector alone , they have a group of companies or if not they want to improvise their establishments by entering into different fields . <\s>
<s> Standing in the place alone cannot make them further more successful , and here i remember the saying `` Success is not a destination it is a journey '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are many establishments of famous people which grow step by step trying new things out for the newer generation needs and the one who gets to the need of the trnd is a successful person . <\s>
<s> So in the present days of improvised civilisation and technologies new and new inventions should be done to reach the people and this could only by taking risks , and i personally feel that without risks there are no inventions and no progresses . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> How would one be successful without a risk or trying out new things . <\s>
<s> To state an example how would Dhirubai ambani would be so succesful without his initial risk in investing for the business , with his risk today one of the largest group of Reliance industries come into existence and still expanding day by day with new fields . <\s>
<s> There a lot many examples like this where success lies only after a risk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So tain any field of life success as mentioned is a journey and to pass through this journey several risks are to be taken and if not they will come to a stand still and this will not be called as success So i agree the statement that successful people try newthings rather than doing what they know . <\s>
<s> Trying new things and exploring untouched parts are indispensable parts of development . <\s>
<s> In this context , one may argue against the idea of doing what one already knows how to do well . <\s>
<s> Despite that one cannot make much change and development , one can keep safe from losing something and can be expertise at one subject that the person has been doing so far . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I disagree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , when one tries new stuffs , the person must take risks of losing money or time . <\s>
<s> When doing what one already knows about , one can be safe from the loss . <\s>
<s> For example when people go to a restaurant , most order what they have already tried and what they liked . <\s>
<s> In this way , they can enjoy the food for sure , but if they tried new meals knowing nothing about the food , they can waste money and time eating it . <\s>
<s> As the example illustrates , it is better to do what one is sure about to be safe and enjoyable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , by doing one thing over and over even though the person knows how to do well , the person can obtain experties to the subject . <\s>
<s> Overwelming of empirical evidence conducted over years confirms that continuous practice can make a person expert . <\s>
<s> Having an experties is very important to succeed , so even when people apply to universities or writing resumes , it is important to emphasize and show their unique experties that can be contrated to others . <\s>
<s> In order to get experties , repeating more and more even after knowing about it well is important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By tring new things , one may experience new fields of study or material through some failures , but rather than taking such risks , one can enjoy what one knows without worrying of failure and rather than knowing vast range of stuffs shallowly , being experties at one subject and showing the unique advancement is better . <\s>
<s> In twenty years , there is a possibilty that the amount of cars would decrease in comparison with today . <\s>
<s> Since science and developement is moving on a fast pace , everything is bound to happen . <\s>
<s> Technology is a big part of our lives . <\s>
<s> Scientists could have been researching for a better for transportation . <\s>
<s> In twenty years , they could have found a more efficient way for traveling , other than cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There must be a plan to decrease the amount of cars available on earth . <\s>
<s> Traffic is taking it 's toll on our daily lives . <\s>
<s> The streets are getting more and more crowded . <\s>
<s> In order to have fewer cars traveling around , there must be an invention done first . <\s>
<s> In twenty years , there could be more trains , as well as different types of trains too . <\s>
<s> There could be sky trains , and underground trains too . <\s>
<s> There also could be an underground transport system . <\s>
<s> It could resemble the one present today , but it would have to definetely be bigger with larger amounts of trains , buses , and probably a new invention too . <\s>
<s> Pollution is a big topic today . <\s>
<s> By the time twenty years are passed , there would be a different concept of transportation available , and pollution would not be one of it 's side effects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We have heard about the different types of possible alterations that could be done to present transporation systems . <\s>
<s> In twenty years , there would probably be a whole new aspect to these systems . <\s>
<s> In addition to those we have today , more planes , buses , and trains would be invented . <\s>
<s> Each type of system could have a region or destrict to work in on it 's own . <\s>
<s> The transportation systems would be more efficient . <\s>
<s> New gadgets and inventions would take over the ones we have today . <\s>
<s> There would be a whole new era , where cars would be of no interest . <\s>
<s> I disagree this topic that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Present society needs a specialist in every ways . <\s>
<s> There is famous idiom in Korean . <\s>
<s> `` A man who has a various character ca n't eat breakfast . '' <\s>
<s> This is right . <\s>
<s> A man who has broad knowledge of various subjects cannot be accepted this community and company which ask special skill . <\s>
<s> For example , My friend who studied several university could not be selected by any companies . <\s>
<s> He has several degrees and a lot of knowledge and skill . <\s>
<s> but it is not special , just common . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So He is looking for his job until now . <\s>
<s> How a funny fact it is ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , We must remember one more important point . <\s>
<s> These days , All of famous people is one point specialist . <\s>
<s> Why ? <\s>
<s> The reason that a real ability on inside us is revealed by continously efforts when we do our best just one point . <\s>
<s> When we try to develop our career that hiding inside us constantly , we can make our most beautiful ability and other people also aknowledge it . <\s>
<s> It is clear that common people can remember only one or two person on their life . <\s>
<s> I want to tell one more example . <\s>
<s> As we know , there are so many pastor in United states we ca n't count the numbers . <\s>
<s> But how many pastor 's name we can remember ? <\s>
<s> Just one or two pastor . <\s>
<s> Why ? <\s>
<s> The reason famous is connected with specialism . <\s>
<s> I can remember just one American pastor . <\s>
<s> His name is Billy Graham who is famous for public evangelistic services . <\s>
<s> He visited so many countries to preaching a gospel toward unbelievers . <\s>
<s> And He concentrated just one point that preaching a gospel toward unbelievers especially other countries . <\s>
<s> As times goes on , Billy was awared all over the world , finally He could saved so many people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Through the life of Billy , we can know why a specialism so important to us . <\s>
<s> Because of these reason , I disagree that topic . <\s>
<s> Knowladge is very important issue that people should have but how to learn is most important part of the knowladge . <\s>
<s> In some countries like Turkey , people are forced to learn to fact rather than understand the ideas and concept . <\s>
<s> I strongly belive that understanding ideas and concepts is more important to keep your knowladge widely and long time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students usually have a problem with little information in one subject . <\s>
<s> To have a large information about one specific topic , students should learn how to relate the informations about they heard and read . <\s>
<s> For instanse , two group of students are learning something about the animal names . <\s>
<s> In one of the these groups , students learn facts and memorise that information . <\s>
<s> The second groups are learning where these names comes from and the main points of this topic . <\s>
<s> Some time later , if you ask a question about unfamiliar name of animal , first group of people can not explain the topic while the others have some information about the question . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , the main problem in learning is forgeting the information that is learned before . <\s>
<s> This big problem 's only solution is understanding the main points and ideas . <\s>
<s> According to the my teacher the most important point in learning is forgeting the information because of not learning the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Student can easily learn and memorise the facts , but this knowladge does n't take too much time . <\s>
<s> The major point is that if you learn how the topics are related and where that information comes from , it can make sense in your brain . <\s>
<s> After long time passes you will still remember a little information about the subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion , people 's learnning styles tale really substantinal role in keeping the information widely and long time and as I said before the best solution is understanding ideas and concept . <\s>
<s> Time is getting knowladge and using this knowladge in your work . <\s>
<s> At this point people may know the topic they studied on , but they drammatiacly do n't know how they use this information . <\s>
<s> yes , I agree because the technology has been developed in a short time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In another time the cars were shlowly and biger ones as the cars today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The cars in the past needed many tieme to arraive to another locations , to get in the olders cars was no confortable and the process to made theirs was old and with out wins . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In a short time the cars ' industry have growned up . <\s>
<s> Today we can do longer distances in a short time . <\s>
<s> We feel us confortable inside a car because there are many technological improves in theirs . <\s>
<s> We have warm or cold air , much place , und luxury . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In a cupple of time the cars may be will be fewer , other wo n't be need tires maybe will be arrive the light speed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Maybe in twenty years we wo n't need cars , maybe we can move by phone or by other aparats . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We have to check or to lookig for the new technological improvs in computer systems or in comunications systems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Actually the cars have today the possibility to see their lokations by satelit , the GPC sistems are moderns , and we can find a rood or a way vary easy . <\s>
<s> The cars have today telephons or radio . <\s>
<s> Maybe in twenty years the cars will be used televitions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now the world looking for a clean energy , many cars today use erths ' Gas , or alcohol , instead normal gas , or diesel . <\s>
<s> Diesel produce many waste into the air altrought their used a protection . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the next years many companies will looking for a car that he can run with two or trie tipes from energy , maybe solar energy or why not electricity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is many posibilities in the cars ' industry because is a rich industry . <\s>
<s> BMW , Hansa or another companies improov many types of technology and process to give the costumers many posibilities and many chances . <\s>
<s> Some pupils often claim about the fact that they have to learn so much facts on things that they are not really interested in . <\s>
<s> But this problem is sometimes only based on the thing that pupils just have not understood the ideas of the theme . <\s>
<s> Therefore I think it is more important for pupils as well as for students to get clear with the ideas and how these ideas are developed than just to learn about the facts . <\s>
<s> I agree that theory is important but all the other things should be then strengthen by practising . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The most important argument is that without having understand the idea or the concept of the special topic that is being worked on in class it is just useless for the student to learn the facts based on the topic . <\s>
<s> In a certain test the student may can list all the facts that he has learned but does absolutely not understand in what context they are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I think it is more important that the students learn about the theory in the lessons and than practice it in the world . <\s>
<s> If there is for instance a student of medicine who has always learned very carefully all the factors that have something to do with anatomy it is the best way to strengthen his skills by giving him the opportunity to have an exam on a real dead body . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , Students may just be overwhelmed by all the facts they are supposed to learn and can therefore just forget the real content of the idea . <\s>
<s> Looking behind the facade is very important for a student so that eventually he can really cope with all the factors and of course also the problems connected with this concept . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion it is absolutely more important for a student to understand the ideas than to learn the facts , because practise is more important than theory and students should not be overwhelmed by the facts of a certain topic . <\s>
<s> It is a controversial issue whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Depending on personal experience or pesonality type , some will support the former one , while others will choose the later one . <\s>
<s> But it is too absolute to say that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> In short , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects has countless advantages , otherwise , to specialize in one specific subject has a great number of advantages too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , to have broad knowledge of many academic can help you to have a more colorful life than the to specialize in mere one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Some people do not like to focus on one single subject for it is too boring for them to learn due to their own personalities . <\s>
<s> Futhermore , to have broad knowledge is the significant skill because all the things are related . <\s>
<s> It is much easier for the people to deal with the things in other fields of areas . <\s>
<s> Maybe it will help the people to earn more money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Though to have broad knowledge has the many advantages , to specialize in one specific subject also has great advantages . <\s>
<s> If people specialize in one specific subject , he or she can learn more about the knowledge and have deeper understanding of the subjects he or she concentrates on . <\s>
<s> There is no doult it will help the people to get a good job in their areas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my point of veiw , either to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject should be according to the personalities of different people . <\s>
<s> If you can enjoy yourselve in either , this will be the perfect choise you make . <\s>
<s> I agree with the following statement . <\s>
<s> I feel so because names like mother teresa , nelson mandela who devoted there whole life towards upliftment of the human fraternity , have now become only the characters in the history text books . <\s>
<s> One could find young names engrossed in any kind of eugenic activity in only lilliputian amount . <\s>
<s> The passion , the zeal towards one 's country , ones community or fraternity has effaced in the annals of history . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the paramount reason behind this is that world today has become much more relaxed than it was before . <\s>
<s> I particularly feel that `` NEED '' is the root of all deeds . <\s>
<s> Young generation does not see any `` need '' to practise such activities as the `` mileu '' around them is much more out of sufferrings as it was a few decades ago . <\s>
<s> Another reason is the lack of appropriate moral teachings being given to them . <\s>
<s> Attitude does not change overnight , right from childhood one has to inculcate these feelings in one 's persona . <\s>
<s> Moral teachings are much more pedantic or limited to bookish knowledge , and hence they are not able to feel the suffering around the world . <\s>
<s> They are not taken to rendevouz with the real world , like the world prevailing in the parts of africa . <\s>
<s> Therefore youngsters remain in there own blues and hence are not aware of the present scenario . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I think that media has a lot of role to play in arousing the blood in these people to flutter . <\s>
<s> Media can be in any form , may it be television , newspaper or sophisticated internet tools . <\s>
<s> Thinking of our young generation is largely influenced by the monster caled media , they think what media thinks . <\s>
<s> Hence if media plays a vital role in changing the thinking of young people from , rather than being indifferent to their community to feel concern towards their community then it could have an comprehensive effect on the current scenario . <\s>
<s> I definitely disagree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because I know that a lot of young people work for their communities as volunterre . <\s>
<s> I would like to offer some examples to support my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , there are a large number of students at my university who are interested in helping their communities . <\s>
<s> For exmple , when I went to the volunterre meeting at the university a few days ago , although it was still on summer vacation , the meeting room was packed with students who wanted to volunterre . <\s>
<s> I was so exited to see and know that the number of students made time for the meeting . <\s>
<s> It shows the fact that there are a lot of young studets who are interested in helping their communities and make time for it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , I know that a lot of my freinds are working for volunterre already . <\s>
<s> Moreover , at the meeting of this kind , I have seen a lot of young people who join for volunterre including from different universities , locations and backgrounds . <\s>
<s> If young people have not given enought time to supporting their communities acitively these days how come I have seen these people ? <\s>
<s> Also I know that they are not only suppoting their communities but also they are willing to do it . <\s>
<s> They feel more reponsible to the community through the acitivity . <\s>
<s> Doing these activities give them a lot of satisfation as a member of communities and society . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For these reasons , I disagree the idea strongly that young people today do not make enought time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , as long as I know , they participate more to help their communities . <\s>
<s> According to what is illustrated , i agree that fewer cars will be in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> Almost every evidnece is implying for such occasion where the economic , pollution , politics ... <\s>
<s> all such situation will have an influence on such phenomenon . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason , many studies and reaserches emphasize that the exceeding number of cars is promoting the increase in the greenhouse event . <\s>
<s> So , as a challenge for such case am sure that many government will introduce new laws thats will extremelly restric from the expanding of such danger event . <\s>
<s> Despite the advantage of cars , in the near future we will be under tremendous challenge due to disadvantage of cars on environment and social life , so we must search about something substitute such danger transportation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , civils all over the world will be unable to fullfill their cars with the needed fuel due to the increase in prices of such material . <\s>
<s> This future aspect will force governments to rasie the prices of fuel , simply from the decline in the amounts of such substance in its origin places , as such event is occuring from the excess supplying and the carelessness for the accuarte foundation of such materail . <\s>
<s> Am not stating my view , as such facts are being implyed by many scientists . <\s>
<s> Finally , the overuse of such transportation way and the increase of population around the earth lead to a miserable and conflict operation in human movements , here governments will interfer to decline such overuse and put laws that reinforce such duty . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Anyone can touch the evidences for the restriction of such familiar man-made . <\s>
<s> Thus we will be forced to leave away such transportation and will try to find the new technological invention . <\s>
<s> I think it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> In my opinion it happens particularly during spots on television : in fact each of us can remember that he brought something because it was introduced very well , or because the spot was really nice or interesting . <\s>
<s> It happens because the power of tv is too much strong , in fact each of us has a tv and watches it every day . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All the reasons that cause this phenomenum concerne business , in fact industries use spots to convince people that their products are very useful and they always insist about the good quality of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion sometimes producers lie because they want to be richer and richer , but sometimes they lie because they live in a critical economic period , even if I do n't want to justify them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact we must consider that in the period of globalisation a lot of products have generated a real invasion of market all over the world , and it is very difficult for industries to defend their products because the competition with other products is hard . <\s>
<s> About this aspect we can remember the most important new element of global economic , that is represented by the Chinese market . <\s>
<s> This market through its low prices causes a real crisis of modern economy and forces a lot of European or American industries to be more competitive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result a lot of this industries try to send their products by doing false advertisements about their qualities . <\s>
<s> I think it is completely wrong because the customers always want to buy faithful products , characterised by a real good quality ; so if they are not satisfied by things they buy , they will change products immediately , particularly in the period of globalisation , during which you can find a big variety of products . <\s>
<s> I absolutelly disagree with this statement , because you can turn it around and this will change the meaning of this statement : You know a bit of everything but you ca n't do anything really good . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course if you are not specialized , you can talk with everyone about everything but when a couple of specialist have a conversation , you come to a point where you do n't understand a word anylonger . <\s>
<s> You never will understand the really important facts about a subject , that 's why you are hard-speaking not really usefull . <\s>
<s> I have a medical disease , for example , then I will ask a doctor and not someone who knows a bit about the human body . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It also comes to my mind that it is a difficult situation at the university . <\s>
<s> For example you have to write an essay then it 'll be pretty hard to make high-qualified researches , because you do n't understand the important and complicated things . <\s>
<s> That 's why your grades will properly be worse than the ones of a specialist . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Further I have to think about the job market , e. g. the one of germany . <\s>
<s> We have many people who are unemployed and search for a work . <\s>
<s> If a company needs a thatcher , than they do n't need someone who can work a little bit with wood , who knows a little bit about the law and last but not least has already made the roof a house . <\s>
<s> They need just a specialiced thatcher . <\s>
<s> That means if you are not specialized you are n't often interessting for companys , and it 'll be hard to find a job . <\s>
<s> Of course there are exceptions , but to speak in general it 's just harder to achieve the goals in your life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all I really would recommend anyone to specialize on something , because then you are able to put all your effort in this subject , it 'll be easier to earn earn good grades and last but not least to find a job , that fits to your interests . <\s>
<s> I do not agree that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' , because cars are most useful transportation today , and it is not easy to create brand new machine in twenty years , and nowadays there are more eco-cars on the roads , and car drivers care about the nature recently . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The useful points of cars are that there are many road to drive and they are more than rollways or subways , and you can go close places to far places individualy . <\s>
<s> Because of the good points , when you go your family trip , the car makes you more confortable , and it is easy to make your own original plans . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I guess that it is easyier to make cars easy to drive and confortable spase than create new machine . <\s>
<s> Some people might say that driving is too rough and make them tired . <\s>
<s> However technical skills are growing up day by day , it mat be not far futhure that you do not have to drive a car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some peole are considering the effort of cars to enviroment . <\s>
<s> They think it is good to use trains and busses rahter than your own car . <\s>
<s> However , the eco-car can slove the problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays , the use og eco-cars are rising and considering about our natures . <\s>
<s> Moreover , driving car will be easy and confortable because of recently the high technical skills . <\s>
<s> From the past , the cars are the most useful machine for indivisuals and also pubric . <\s>
<s> I do not think cars use will not down , people still depend on their cars . <\s>
<s> Cars will be still the most used transportation in twenty years . <\s>
<s> The statement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' contains a lot of aspects which can be analysed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , i do not agree fully with the statement given . <\s>
<s> These are some predictions of what may happen in the future with our everyday transport : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In twenty years ' time technology will have advanced importantly . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , the population in becoming aware of the Earth 's environmental problems . <\s>
<s> A great amount of the society recycles , and does not waste energy . <\s>
<s> Many scientists are investigating new ways to save energy . <\s>
<s> And cars and transports in general are one of the most polluting producers . <\s>
<s> Is there a non polluting substitute for them ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today , many investigators are looking for an alternative to cars that will not destroy the Earth . <\s>
<s> There are already some cars that work with petrol substitutes , but they are not very popular . <\s>
<s> If we found a way to preserve the environment without not using our cars , there would not be fewer cars in the future , but safetier for the planet . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some examples of non polluting transports are becoming popular in many parts of the world , like bycicles . <\s>
<s> Many people , mostly persons who live alone or without children , take their bycicles to go to work or the city . <\s>
<s> But this alternative cannot be accepted by everybody as there not everyone lives alone or in the city . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , the only way the number of cars will decrease in the future is with new technological inventions . <\s>
<s> Maybe in twenty years time we will all travel around by private planes , or by flying skates ... <\s>
<s> Who knows ? <\s>
<s> It all depends on our future inventors and their imagination to create an easier and less polluting way to travel . <\s>
<s> The world at present seems to be a technologically innovated place every individual find no gap to spendfor himself . <\s>
<s> Inthis fast running world every individual should be quick enough to grab the oppurtunity he might get . <\s>
<s> This is the case , which implies to the young people also because as these people going to start their career in this world . <\s>
<s> I strongly agree that young people are not able to find their time to help thier community . <\s>
<s> This essay look after the reasons why these people does n't find time to help community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At first , now a days the money being the main criteria of living people are working to earn more money as they can to live happily . <\s>
<s> This is the case where the young people stumbles . <\s>
<s> As they start their new career they run after work which get them more money . <\s>
<s> They have been new to tthis kind of life they weremore entusiastic in earning money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , they being new they have less money in their pockets so they are eager to earn money which makes them a working monsters . <\s>
<s> As their mindes were coming out of the narrow shells of knowledge the companies are exploiting these young people by making them to work . <\s>
<s> This eventually makes less time to kick back on their bed also . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , these young people being ambitious and energitics , they are intrested to work more fullfill thair needs . <\s>
<s> These people are also fascinated to many costliy thing and luxeries they find in movies . <\s>
<s> So , to get these thing they tend to work more . <\s>
<s> Being at the young age they are not bothered of the world they do think for themselves . <\s>
<s> These young people has rebelion way of thinking they are stubborn to their beleifs . <\s>
<s> So , they donot care of their community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , it is the main fact that in money driven world young people are influenced by money so that they are not bothered of their community and not intrested in helping thier community . <\s>
<s> In response to the statement given sideways , I express my approval for it . <\s>
<s> Young people nowadays seem to be more interested and involved in their own life and problems than the community as a whole . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The present day world has undergone a dramatic change than it used to be , say a generation ago . <\s>
<s> It has become much more competitive and demanding . <\s>
<s> The advent of globalisation has led to drastic repercussions . <\s>
<s> In today 's world only the best can survive . <\s>
<s> Recently an article was there in newspaper on globalisation . <\s>
<s> It was stated there that globalisation is producing rich countries with poor people not only in developing countries but also in developed countries like the United States . <\s>
<s> The fruits of globalisation are mainly distributed among the rich and the highly skilled persons . <\s>
<s> Unskilled and less skilled labor are no longer the recipients of these fruits . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This puts an immense pressure on young people to achieve great skill in whatever art they are pursuing . <\s>
<s> They could not devote enough time for other causes , like any work related to the upliftment of their communities . <\s>
<s> For them their own survival is the key issue . <\s>
<s> They want to be a part of the ongoing globalisation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , they do not find any potential benefit in lending a helping hand to their communities . <\s>
<s> All they can think of is their own well-being . <\s>
<s> Whether they are getting any output by doing so , is what the young people 's thinking is . <\s>
<s> In short , the world has become much more materialistic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also young people lacks the sense of responsibility which prevents them in helping their communities . <\s>
<s> They think that just by being a part of a community and following its rules and regulations is sufficient . <\s>
<s> They have forgotten the fact that with rights comes duties . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , I would once again like to support the statement that young people are not giving enough time in helping their communities . <\s>
<s> With time generations start living on different life standards where they start looking out for them selves more than their own community . <\s>
<s> the meaning of democracy came from the latin word democratus which was writin by Aristotle , a famous greek philosopher . <\s>
<s> the meaning of democrasy is when a group of people are working for a common cause to help their own country or civilization . <\s>
<s> I think that people today areussualy more keen on helping their own desires even if their own desires can interfere with other peoples standars or affairs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Darwin 's Theory `` Survival of the fitist , '' is what basically going on in the world today . <\s>
<s> i for one like to help both the community and my self , but i would stop helping the community if doing so will effect me personnaly . <\s>
<s> One thing i have noticed is that helping the community is in such a low level , that most school require community service in order for a student to graduate , forcing people to help the community is a great sign that people are not really paying attention to their own community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Helping the community can come in many different forms ; polution , respect , civilized behavior and following the rules. a person can help his community by buying unleaded cars causing less smoke in the enviroment , another problem that can be characterized as polution is littering , i have watched many people in my community litter as the government doesnt have strict rules for people to abide by them . <\s>
<s> respect between people in the same community is quite necessary where a person should never fight another person or argue , which is good for communal stabilization . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People should work harder on helping their communities instead of their own , because by doing so your benefiting yourself and the people around you inderectly . <\s>
<s> If the community is shown as as a quiet peaceful community then the urge to benefit ones self will become less , for other people can be benefiting you . <\s>
<s> Automobile industry is growing at afast rate . <\s>
<s> every day we are coming to know that new car is launched and the cars of different brands are introdused . <\s>
<s> even the older ones are relaunched with new features . <\s>
<s> so this is out of the question that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today , cars are really important in todays world . <\s>
<s> there are so many reasons behind this but the most important one is the basic need of car in our daily life . <\s>
<s> we are so much busy in our routine work . <\s>
<s> one has to go to office , attending meetings etc , \ . <\s>
<s> and the cars are the easiest way of to and fro . <\s>
<s> they help us to reach on time . <\s>
<s> if there will be no cars , life will be really impossible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> secondly , the other reason which support the idea is the new technological devlopments . <\s>
<s> new techniology is really helpful in the devlopments and the launch of new cars . <\s>
<s> it would directly effect the automobile industry . <\s>
<s> and may lead to unemployment . <\s>
<s> the future will be at stake and the resukt will be disastrous . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> thirdly and the importantis the love and passion the people have with the different types of cars . <\s>
<s> ther are so many fast cars or right to say sports cars are now availabel . <\s>
<s> and all these cars are having big brand names . <\s>
<s> so many people are now making it as their carrer . <\s>
<s> they are known or we can say that their identity is related to the cars Micheal schumaker is an example for this . <\s>
<s> and he is also a role model for so many . <\s>
<s> so many young people are fascinated with the idea of driving fast cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> to conclude , we can say that it is impossible that the cars wiill be less seen on the roads after twenty years . <\s>
<s> infact there will be more cars and after twenty years every one will be driving the cars because of the tough competition between the companies . <\s>
<s> every one would afford and will have the pleasure of driving it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> love for the cars will never be less or eliminated especially among the young generation . <\s>
<s> people are fond of cars with good features . <\s>
<s> in coming years thare will <\s>
<s> OK , first of all I cant say that I agree or disagree because some times I agree and some times I do n't becouse I think that depends on the person hem self and his charecter , if that person can stand up for risks and challanges that he 's going to face by takeing that way ? ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now I will asume that you want me to give or choose only one of the answers so am going with No , I for one do n't think that a successful people should try doing new things and to take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 1 - Because he could fail to succed in that new feild and then he wont be taken as a successful person . <\s>
<s> 2 - If he fails to succed in that he will waist abig period of time by taking a risk and most likelly he will feel down and dispointed in hem self . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 3 - I belive that people should do what they love most because then they will do there best in it to succeed . <\s>
<s> 4 - In my obenion I see that its much better to know what am doing than feeling lost with something new on me . <\s>
<s> 5 - I think that if aperson have a goal that he wants to achive he must do his best to get to his goal and not to let risks to stand in his way even if he fails sometimes he should go back and try again and to tell him self that he did't fail but he learnd something new that this is the wrong way to it , thats what adison saied to him self after 1000 of faild experiments to invent electresty . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finlly , the seccessful peoson is the person who goes after his dream . <\s>
<s> The question is being asked if the ideas and concepts are more important for the students than learning facts . <\s>
<s> This is very important issue about the education because the students have to know every thing about the life and the world from their schools and teachers and their educational books , I think the education is kind of curiosity that has to give the students all what they need . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , that the schools as well as the parents have to give the students the opportunity to learn every thing in this world by its facts and the ideas and the concepts , because some times if you do n't have any information about the real fact you ca n't get to any point of the concept that you looking for . <\s>
<s> for instance what was thinking about the Earth that is revolve around the sun . <\s>
<s> if this issue is not able to be learn at school , no one can imagine how things can revolve around each other by gravity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , teaching fact to the students let them ask more questions about that issue may lead them to understant and may lead them to figure out more concepts in the entire world , like if the students been taught that , not just because you see the entire scene in front of you flat that mean the Earth is flat . <\s>
<s> the earth is round not flat . <\s>
<s> And what you just seen is according the angle of your scene . <\s>
<s> so these facts will be in the mind of the students and will never forget it period , and the students will think with similar issue that makes that ideas or concept in the bottom of their minds and hearts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I mentioned points that seem to be important to the students to understand ideas and concepts as well as the learn the facts in order to know every thing about the world that we live in <\s>
<s> In our actual society , we can not avoid advertisements ; we totally live in a advertising space . <\s>
<s> we find them every where around us : On the television screen with so many commercials every ten minutes , in the news papers , in magazines , in the street ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> however most of those advertisments are just good publicity , and nothing more . <\s>
<s> advertisements agencies spend hours and hours every day to find a new product which will attract more clients . <\s>
<s> And lmost of the time , they privilege quantity to quality . <\s>
<s> in such case , they make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> they used very various ways to attract us , and most of the time pertinent or attractive visual images in oder to catch our attention . <\s>
<s> lets just think about the huge number of advertisements to loose wait . <\s>
<s> they choose thinny models , who are slim by nature , make us believe that thanks to their new performant diet product , they lost calories in a very short time and got this amazing results . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> but when buyers use the product they are often disappointed by it . <\s>
<s> sometimes they get in part the results they expected and sometimes no results at all . <\s>
<s> morever , some brands try to fool people , spending huge amounts of many to get a star to represent their brand and appear on their advertisement campaign . <\s>
<s> but even those brands are not even better , they just have take a bet on the visual aspect in order to better attract us to buy something not eventually more efficient or usefull . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> often we buy stuff that actually we dont need or are not useful at all , just because we have been influenced by the products advertisement . <\s>
<s> besides , if you make a survey on the efficiency of products bought from , a given population , probably much more than the half will assume that those products were not as good as they looked on the advertisements . <\s>
<s> publicities are elaborated to get into our mind , and make us think that we need a given product whereas its probably not the case . <\s>
<s> for example , teenagers often buy their favorite stars , specially girls , in order to ressemble to their icon . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> that why , i hereby think that most of advertisements seem much better t <\s>
<s> I think that the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are is right . <\s>
<s> In fact advertising is made for the purpose of push people to buy a product even when it is not needed . <\s>
<s> To do so the good has to seem much more better than what it really is . <\s>
<s> The funny thing is that the mismatching between what is advertised and the real product is openly declared everywhere as it could be read in small fonts that the object can be different than how is picted on the advertising or the box . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An example is when drugs are advertised on television . <\s>
<s> They show someone that feels sick and as soon as the little pill is swallowed he or she gets back to work as nothing has appened . <\s>
<s> I guess this could be dangerous too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example is when in a fast food restaurant there are pictures that show wonderful hamburgers that do not look like the hamburgers I get to eat . <\s>
<s> I also remember when I was a little boy and I saw an advertising about an ice-cream on TV . <\s>
<s> The ice-cream looked so good that I felt that I had to have one . <\s>
<s> As soon as I could I went to buy that ice cream , but when I unwrapped it and I saw how the ice cream was in the real life I felt like a fool and got very disappointed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion I think that when we look at advertised product we should do it with criticism and be aware of the differences between pictures and real life . <\s>
<s> As a senior in high school is sitting in a roon , he is trying to figure out what he wants to become in the future . <\s>
<s> How does a person decide ? <\s>
<s> School has given students the opportunity to learn many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Whether it is Math , or Chemistry the broad knowledge that it is atteined serves as a help to discover the inner talents and creativity that a person might posess . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During senior year , one of the hardest decisions is to pick the major or career one wants to do in college . <\s>
<s> Would it have help is a student only study one specific subject ? <\s>
<s> Is that really the students truly interest ? <\s>
<s> I am senior in high school . <\s>
<s> At first all I though I like was math , and all I wanted to do was math . <\s>
<s> However , the school required some other regular classes and electives . <\s>
<s> My junior year in high school , I decided to take computer programming and I felt in love with it . <\s>
<s> Then this year I currently have physics and it is like my favorite class in the world . <\s>
<s> When it came down to make a decision of what I wanted to do with my life , I took all the different classes I took into consideration . <\s>
<s> Since , I had such a broad knowledge of many subjects like math , physics , and computer , I narrow it down to electrical and computer engineering . <\s>
<s> I am very glad that the school provides such a verity of classes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , this does n't only apply to education if not to everyday life as well . <\s>
<s> A person may know how to count and mix chemicals together , but can he or she write a letter ? <\s>
<s> Life does n't rely on one subject , if not on many . <\s>
<s> It would be very useful to have a least a little bit of knowledge on different types of subjects . <\s>
<s> With this on mind a person does n't always need to rely on others for help . <\s>
<s> A chemist can write correct reports . <\s>
<s> A writer can keep organize his finances . <\s>
<s> In the end , to go through life it is better to have a broad mind . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the study of many subjects gives the choice to experiment different activities , and helps to discover ones interests in life and goals . <\s>
<s> It is useful on making decisions and surviving life . <\s>
<s> A broad knowledge is the key to ones inner talents and creations . <\s>
<s> Most people like to travel . <\s>
<s> Some of them are trying to travel by themselves . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , rest of them intend to follow a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Both of them have each reasonable advantages . <\s>
<s> However , I do not think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> If I have a chance to travel , I will travel alone or with a few friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , I believe that traveling is to get my own expirence . <\s>
<s> Initially , I know that following a tour guide is more convenience , but I think that purpose of traveling is not being convenience . <\s>
<s> Expiriencing new world and new culture is goal of it . <\s>
<s> I had two exprience of travel . <\s>
<s> One of them was travel to Japan , and another was travel to U.S. the travel to Japan was not to follow a guide . <\s>
<s> My friends and I made every plan and reservation . <\s>
<s> Surely , It was a little bit difficult but experience that we got at that time made us mentally strongly . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , travelling to U.S. was fun and easy for a guide , but I did not have any special memory about that trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , One of meaning of travel is take some space from our regular lives . <\s>
<s> If we travel alone or with just a few friends , we can do it . <\s>
<s> But , following a guide should not allow to do it . <\s>
<s> There are so many plans and events . <\s>
<s> Sometimes those things can make a travel funny , but often those can make it irritating . <\s>
<s> Nobody wants to spend money on meaningless things . <\s>
<s> If a travelling is a way that make you escape your life and refresh , which one is more helpful ? <\s>
<s> It seems that there has been an argument that weather young people in this society spend much time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> There are some point of views that student already participate in enough communities . <\s>
<s> However , in my opinion this cannot be true in terms of ... <\s>
<s> In this essay . <\s>
<s> I will briefly present two reasons supporting my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of all , individualism cause young people nowadays not to consern about their communities . <\s>
<s> Most of family in this country has one or two children , and they cannot have a chance to experience of cooperation . <\s>
<s> They grew up only with their parents and without no sibilings so it is hard to know to share or yield for others that can learn from large family . <\s>
<s> As a result , these children tend to behave individually and do not think about others who need help . <\s>
<s> This is the main reason why I think young people hardly help others in their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , the schools and other organizations require student to do something for society without their own will . <\s>
<s> What I mean is that this requirement have bad influence on student . <\s>
<s> It may help students spend at least time to volunteer but they will become avoid helping others because of this rule , which is essential to go to good school or get a better job in our country . <\s>
<s> In my point of view , the helping someone that they do n't want makes them do not any volunteer work except requird time . <\s>
<s> Therefore , rules that have to <\s>
<s> I am agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> It 's true that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As advertisements are used to attract customers and to make the products more popular , the companies would n't lose this chanllege to show the best side of their products . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , they also give an image which is not true of their products to customers . <\s>
<s> This is an image which customers desire but not an image which below to the products . <\s>
<s> We kow that most companies face to a great competition , there are son many comapnies produce the same product . <\s>
<s> So companies have to do much efforts in order to be more stronger . <\s>
<s> Meanwhile , if there is one comopany have atoped some advertisements to make its products more attractif , it 's not fair that others companies of the same sector do nothing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But should customers be victim of companies ' competition and profits ? <\s>
<s> No , we are the customers , and we have the rights to know the truth . <\s>
<s> We want to buy the products which we want . <\s>
<s> We pay for what we desire , and we wo n't pay for lier . <\s>
<s> In some paticular sectors , like medicin , some people died because advertisement did n't give the truth . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But there is n't a rule agains this action . <\s>
<s> So between moral and rule , we should have a correct choice . <\s>
<s> Selecting the number of subjects will basically depend upon many factors . <\s>
<s> However , selecting one specific subject and working over it would help to get complete command over the subject . <\s>
<s> But I personally believe that having command over many subjects would be better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , it can help in making furthur studies . <\s>
<s> By choosing many subjects we can have command over a number of topics which can help us to use it effectively . <\s>
<s> For example , when I was in graduation I had a chance to take either one subject or two subjects . <\s>
<s> I then felt to take two subjects one as my major other as the minor . <\s>
<s> Which helped me to learn both Finance and Marketing . <\s>
<s> I also felt the importance of selecting the two subjects when i want to make out the project in final semister . <\s>
<s> Which helped me to work for two subject , which are Finance and Marketing . <\s>
<s> So I was able to prepare two projects which inturn helped me to keep up my final grades . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , it will increase our knowledge . <\s>
<s> When we study about more subjects it can increase our knowledge about all of them . <\s>
<s> When I was in school days we used to have general knowledge and moral science as our extra subjects . <\s>
<s> I felt great benefit of these subjects when i matured as a student . <\s>
<s> It helped me to participate in quiz competitions and also helped me to increase the helping nature where i learnt through moral science . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , it makes us to have a fruitfull career . <\s>
<s> When the time comes for me to make out a job , the command over different subjects can help me to secure a good job . <\s>
<s> Where I can have a number of choices and I can choose the field which is good . <\s>
<s> So , it helps to have a good and fruitfull career . <\s>
<s> When I completed graduation , as i studied both marketing and finance as subjects in my graduation , it helped me to fetch a job in both the fields . <\s>
<s> So I had a choice to prefer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , because of these reasons I prefer that learing about more subjects helps us in different ways . <\s>
<s> Even though learing about a particular subject can bring specialisation , I still believe to have broad knowledge of many subjects . <\s>
<s> Although there are reasons to disagree with this statement , I agree with . <\s>
<s> Indeed , successful people try to do a lot of new things . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of reasons I will support this opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , if you want to be successful you have to be better than other people because that is the definition of success . <\s>
<s> In order to be better you must actually behave in another way than other people . <\s>
<s> Then you have the chance to succeed . <\s>
<s> If you hope to be successful without doing things in another way than other people you have to be better than most of them . <\s>
<s> This is a very tricky task . <\s>
<s> That means that probably more people are successful who are risk-loving . <\s>
<s> A famous example is Bill Gates who was a highly talented student . <\s>
<s> However , he was not only better than other students he took also risks rather than the other students and founded a small company with the name Microsoft . <\s>
<s> Today , Bill Gates is the richest man allive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , if you take risks it is highly possible not to reach the personal aim and you may fail . <\s>
<s> However , if you do not take risks it is not possible to reach high aims at all . <\s>
<s> Maybe the possibility to fail is higher but it is also higher to reach your personal aims . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , you must have the attitude to improve you characteristics all the time . <\s>
<s> That regards technical skills , for example to handle computer-problems , as well as social ones like the behaviour in groups . <\s>
<s> The willingness to improve yourself together with the the personal claim searching always the best alternative increases the probability to be successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , although there are a lot of risks trying new things and to behave unusualy , it is the only possibility to be successful , if you do not only trust in winning a lottery , because you have to be better than the others . <\s>
<s> When it comes to the questions of whether it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts or for the students to learn facts , different people might have totally different answers to the question . <\s>
<s> In my view , it is more important for the students to learn facts . <\s>
<s> The reasons go as fellows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , the facts are about experience . <\s>
<s> To learn the facts can make the study more practical . <\s>
<s> Considering that if a student just learn the idea and the concepts in his or her study , he or she just know what it is because the concept told him or her . <\s>
<s> However , he or she may not understand how to use it or what it is for to learn such thing . <\s>
<s> The problem is that they did not related the idea and concept to facts . <\s>
<s> They should learn to analysis facts use the learning of concepts , making their study more practical . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , it is more usefl for the students to learn facts . <\s>
<s> As we know , the purpose for people to study ideas and concepts is to use it and make contribution to our lives . <\s>
<s> Our lives consist many of facts , and we need to study the facts and make them useful to us . <\s>
<s> If we just study ideas and concepts , it means nothing to our scociety . <\s>
<s> The ideas and concepts are just the basis of facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is ture that we need to learn the ideas and concepts first and then we can learn and understand the facts better . <\s>
<s> It is also true that leaning ideas and concepts is the basis thing for us to practice our knowledge . <\s>
<s> I also admit that ideas and concepts play important role in human study . <\s>
<s> However , in comparision with the importance to fianlly get used to our lives , facts is more important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , based on the resons I discussed above , even though others may have totally different opinoins with me , i still belive that facts is more important . <\s>
<s> Well history has given enough examples that successfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing the same thing . <\s>
<s> I strongly beleive in that . <\s>
<s> I have good experince about that i worked six years steadly working in a same manner as like other in my medical proffession but than after i shiffted to new research based studies and that helped me greatly in improving my knowledge and offcourse my life and above that patient life . <\s>
<s> I still remember when i discovered new method of treatment how dramatically the results i got but i have taken risk , I left my job for a year and did research on very minute things and definetly thats pay me alot . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As it is mention in history the great `` COLOMBUS `` found the west indies by doing different , like great scientist `` GALLELIO '' who is the first person to say that earth is round like a ball . <\s>
<s> So it is like cristal clear that if some one want to become a successfull person he / she has to do something new . <\s>
<s> Today is a world of competetion or we can say that `` SURVIVAL OF THE FITEST '' . <\s>
<s> one should do some thing different from another . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today world is going into new directions we are exploring in technology , in space , under the earth its only because of those successfull person who did something different . <\s>
<s> Think if we would n't has done these different things in life we wiol probably would be same as animals no inventions no light no telephones . <\s>
<s> today we cannot imagine the world wiyhout theses wonderfull objects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end i would reccomend that every man who want tobe successful in life should think differently and do thIng differents but only and only for improving a man kind and its nature only than a one will be remember you a greatt successfull person . <\s>
<s> I dont agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than old '' . <\s>
<s> In the fast moving era everything in the universe is at constant change . <\s>
<s> Everyone wants to learn more and more inorder to compete with the computer generation . <\s>
<s> If person has good job skills he or she is considered as intellegent . <\s>
<s> Other wise they are beeing considered as mere pippets . <\s>
<s> So i feel older generation is enjoying more than young people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> While i was in college i almost spent most of my week ends doing some assignments or preparing for presentations . <\s>
<s> My grand-father used to ask me to go with him for live conserts . <\s>
<s> which takes place in the other end of our street . <\s>
<s> But i never used to go . <\s>
<s> Because i have to work hard inorder to get good grades . <\s>
<s> He used to talk about those shows for many days . <\s>
<s> He truely enjoyed those times . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If one wants to enjoy he needs money . <\s>
<s> He has to think about many things , if he is the only one who is earning in the house . <\s>
<s> He has to devide his salary to house hold expenses , children education and also to pay taxes . <\s>
<s> But when he gets old most of the expences will be eliminated . <\s>
<s> Like children education and taxes . <\s>
<s> So this is the time they will see some money in their hand . <\s>
<s> So they try to enjoy it for their own life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not only that lately many young people are suffering from lot of stress because of work load . <\s>
<s> Even if they get vacation they are not able enjoy that time because of stress . <\s>
<s> Which inturn leads to many more health problems like high blood pressure or diabetis in their early ages . <\s>
<s> But elderly are far away from all this work related stress as they are nolonger working . <\s>
<s> Whoever have no tensions in life they enjoy the most . <\s>
<s> In my guess thet are old people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> according to me elderly people in our comminity are enjoying the most than young generation . <\s>
<s> They get sufficient to go to clubs or entertainment centers to pass their time which is not possible for youngsters . <\s>
<s> Cars are among the greatest inventions of the time . <\s>
<s> Acting as a product of modern technolody , cars have greatly enhanced our mobility . <\s>
<s> Whenever we want to visit friends , watch a play , or take our children to school , they 're always there . <\s>
<s> Aware of all these benefits , I still believe that the number of cars will greatly decline in two decades . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So serious is the environmental problem on earth that we 're forced into looking for their origins . <\s>
<s> Cars are mainly responsible for the air pollution . <\s>
<s> Hardly can anyone find pure blue sky in a car-intense city . <\s>
<s> Being regarded as of great use , we fail to recognize how many tons of poisonuous gas they produce everytime we drive on the road . <\s>
<s> We have no choice but to limit the use of cars , or else our descendants will only have access to blue sky in the photos and their parents ' memories . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Meanwhile , take a look at the traffic jams in big cities . <\s>
<s> Most people live in noise , work in noise and die in noise . <\s>
<s> How many people are in the hospital , concerning ear problems because of the noise ? <\s>
<s> Numerous . <\s>
<s> How many lives are deprived of by traffic accidents ? <\s>
<s> Countless . <\s>
<s> Who is the killer ? <\s>
<s> The cars . <\s>
<s> Cars are so dangerous that we 're doomed to reduce their number in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With the advance of civilization , there will be fewer cars in the future . <\s>
<s> While some people still live under the illusion that cars are somehow helpful , pollution , noise and accidents are already too high a price we paid for the use of this transportation . <\s>
<s> If cars are not limited , the blue sky , the clean atmosphere , the sense of security of people , will all become a golden memory . <\s>
<s> `` Extreme Succesful People '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The people who tries new things and take bigger risks than usual , are not always succesful and not always people that do not take risks are unsuccesful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that the succes of one person do not depends from if the person is so intrepid or not . <\s>
<s> This is , people can take many risk or try new things but they probably can not reach a bigger succes from whose they do not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my particular experience , I met people who does only one thing but they do it as well as possible . <\s>
<s> And people who see this kind of dedication to work or whatever , recognizes the effort of person . <\s>
<s> And this is a way to know if a person is succesful or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other side , person who tries something new can reach succes but if he or she is alway trying new things , never could do really good . <\s>
<s> This is a person can do many many things and maybe people say `` Oh this man knows a llittle bite of everything '' , and this is right but i say : `` yes , he or she knows about everything , but he can not do a single thing in a perfect way '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason i consider is , that people sometimes do things only to have a little of fun , and they do not dedicate time to improve things that they are doing or knowing even if they take the risk of do something totally new and that it appears the best thing they can do in their all life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> These rasons are why I think the succes of a person do not depends only if they take risk or not , the main reason for me to become a succesful people is `` Dedication '' , this single and simple words involves , in my opinion , they manner in which a man must be if he wants to be someone to whom people recognizes . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Of course you need a little of broad knowledge , especially to be able to talk and understand when you speak with people that are specialized on other fields , but you need to be specialized in one specific subject to do well your work , because you need to know that really well , and it 's impossible to be specialized about everythings . <\s>
<s> Also if you know just a specific subject there is really a lot to know . <\s>
<s> For example , I am a psychologist and there are a lot of fields I could work , like developmental , clinical , health , evaluation and others . <\s>
<s> But everyone of this need a lot of theory and models to know and a lot of experiences to do , that take years to be really prepared in just one of these subjects . <\s>
<s> But after all the training if someone has a problem about what you have specialized you can be sure that you can give him the best support , that you can help him in the best way because you know what you are talking about . <\s>
<s> Instead if you just know a little about everything you ca n't be really helpful but you can just tell to the people where going , usually a specialized centre , to have all the information they need [ that is doing counseling ] . <\s>
<s> After my degree I worked three years in a department of neuropsychology and until now I ca n't say that I know that subject because it 's really wide , so when someone has a neuropsychological problem needs to talk with another one that did a lot of years studing and working in that field , that knows all the acquired brain pathologies and all the tests to do the right diagnosis and that knows also about the rehabilitation , and that is able to explain to the relatives what is going on . <\s>
<s> Of course I do n't want to say that you have to know just about one subject , but that you have to be specialized about one subject and know , i.e. in a less specific way , about many . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I agree that it is better to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> This is not only because the generation we live is an infromation bombing generation , but also because if we can have broad knowldege of many academic subjects we can see this world in different ways . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to some data , there are thousans of new information created every second , that is why we feel time is lost so quickly . <\s>
<s> Though we ca n't read or experience every new creations , we still need to try , otherwise , we wo n't get up with the world . <\s>
<s> Take my mother for example , she is a principle of junior high shcool , she is not very good at the new technic material . <\s>
<s> Every time she wants to add a new cell phone number into her cell phone , she needs asking me to help her . <\s>
<s> One day , she had to manage a new shool , and she would like to make a website to introduce her new school . <\s>
<s> I think she worked very hard on this , and then she made it . <\s>
<s> She made a very beautiful and praticle website on her own ; of course she asked many people for this . <\s>
<s> After this event , I admire her more over . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , my father is a teacher , too . <\s>
<s> Two years ago , he retired , and finally he could go back to farm as he wich . <\s>
<s> Compared with my mother , he rather grows some vegetable than to learn new techonic . <\s>
<s> Until now , he ca n't do something with the computer by himself , although he always says he would like to do that , and of course it never happened . <\s>
<s> I do n't mention that my father is useless , but if he could try and learn more about new subjects , I think his life will be easier and independable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I know there maybe some people think that it is enough for us to specialize in one specific subject , but I suggest them to look forward to the real world . <\s>
<s> We can find new things every day , and we should handle those new things , either . <\s>
<s> If we would like to have a various kinds of life , it is better to have broad knowldege of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> The statement that the successful people take risk is by itself confusing . <\s>
<s> On my one hand are the people who donot want to take the risk and want to grow in the area in which they are the best and on the other hand there are people who want to take the risk and change with the time to excel and succed in life . <\s>
<s> I want to go with the risk takers as in my opinion if you are not taking challenges then you are not progressing and if you become stagnant after some time you will be a looser . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The world is an ever changing place everyday there is some new technology in market over the old technology and the old technology vanishes with time . <\s>
<s> Take the example of Computer science industry if the pioneers such as Bill gates , Steve ballmer have n't taken the risk of stepping in this new area of technology right from the beginning of stepping into it by taking the risk of creating the first graphical based OS to a high graphic resoluted computer what we have now Although , they might have studied something else in life and could have secured a good job and life . <\s>
<s> But no they had to take the risk on doing something new in life and doing what someone has ever done before and show a new way of thinkingto the world and society . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If we follow the footstep of the technology tychoon of India Mr. Naryan murthy we will see that the risk can result in the biggest success of ones life . <\s>
<s> Right from the begining when he was just an employee in a software company in India to the foundation of Infosys . <\s>
<s> We will see that he has taken risk several times in life . <\s>
<s> He was having a successful job in a Reputed company but he had a vision and to follow it he along with his group of friends started a company . <\s>
<s> Which struggled in the slow down of econonmy in end of 1980's . <\s>
<s> He put all his savings in the company to save it and now as we see it is a $ 3 billion organisation . <\s>
<s> This is example of one of the risk takers in life who have succeded in life . <\s>
<s> Although , there is always lot of risk involved , we might loose also . <\s>
<s> But that should n't stop us from following our dream and taking as much risk as possible in life to achieve it Hence , On the basis of the reasons explained above i want to conclude that a successful preson has to take risk in life . <\s>
<s> I think who said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is completely wrong . <\s>
<s> If that right , then who will build the community ? . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Me and you can not forget what the older people do for us and for the community . <\s>
<s> Yes we are still learning from them but we are the power . <\s>
<s> We , the young people , who can build , work hard and develope our community . <\s>
<s> We always try to consume our time beneficially as studying hard to give at last what we can . <\s>
<s> May be what we will give is small thing but it will grow with as with all our wishis to be accpted from the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people try most of the time to detect the mistakes that were done by the older people and keep trying to change it and to improve it . <\s>
<s> They also always keep thinking how to be creactive and finished with a developed community . <\s>
<s> May be that takes alot of time and make them busy little bit but that not mean they do not have time to their community because at last every thing will done for it . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people . <\s>
<s> Young people look at the world in different way when compared to older people . <\s>
<s> Young people have the opportunity to mould their life in the way they want . <\s>
<s> I feel that young people are persistent and are more confident . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people look the world as a sphere containing numerous opportunities . <\s>
<s> They have the tendency to prepare for the future and reach their goals through hard work . <\s>
<s> Young people are more energitic unlike older people . <\s>
<s> This helps young in fulfilling their goals . <\s>
<s> For instance , a boy at seventeen can aspire to become a pilot and even accomplish it through his hardwork and energy . <\s>
<s> This may be difficult for older people because the resposne to react to any kind of situation like moving the accelerator hard reduces with the passage of time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , young people are more persistant . <\s>
<s> They think that they should respect their elders and should not hurt their feelings in any kind . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , older people need not respect their younger ones and have the rigth to behave as they wish . <\s>
<s> Every young person enjoy being persistant . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People at an young stage can plan well for their future because they have lot of life and time infront of them . <\s>
<s> Every person at this stage considers this as a big opportunity and will make their life happier by choosing the carrer they wish ti persue . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that young people can appear attractive by keeping up with the fashion . <\s>
<s> They can wear any kind of outfit they want . <\s>
<s> In conclusion , young people are more energitic , fashionable and persistant . <\s>
<s> Apart from all these the attention that young people get in the public is one main reason that young people enjoy more . <\s>
<s> Is understanding ideas and concepts more important for students than learning fact ? <\s>
<s> This question is quite hard to answer . <\s>
<s> To give an opinion on this topic , we will discuss these points with the use of examples . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , understanding ideas and concepts is crucial . <\s>
<s> How can you understand an issue when you do n't know anything about the subject ? <\s>
<s> You must know the basic ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Let 's take an example : the war in the Middle East , to get your own opinion on this issue you must know what has been going on there , you have to understand the concepts and ideas of the area . <\s>
<s> Another example could be found in economics , you have to understand how a company works in order to manage it well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , ideas and concepts are essential in education , they are the base of your knowledge like the first bricks of a wall . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , facts are important too . <\s>
<s> They help you to understand the concepts and ideas , they provide you further information . <\s>
<s> They are the painting on the wall , sometimes useful but not essential . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , I do n't think learning facts is an interesting way of learning . <\s>
<s> How can you analyze the facts that you just have learnt when you do n't know the concepts and ideas underneath ? <\s>
<s> That 's why I think learning facts is n't as crucial as understanding ideas and concepts for a student . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , I agree with the statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . '' <\s>
<s> . <\s>
<s> Time should be increased on understanding concepts and ideas more than learning facts , nonetheless we sould n't neglect facts , even if they are not vital to build our knowledge , they still add something more . <\s>
<s> There is a common saying in the present society that the modern world is the world belonging to the young and as a result young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> It is just partly right . <\s>
<s> When it comes to thinking about the statment deeply , I consider the life of older peole much better , for the simple reason that only the life they are leading live up to the discription as peaceful , joyful and hamonious . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Initially , they are really living a peaceful life . <\s>
<s> In their late period of life , the old no longer shoulder the burden of earning money and fighting for survive . <\s>
<s> They can choose to get far away from the center of the city where they have spent most of their life and turn to the contryside , where air is more fresher , water is much cleaner and sky is blue instead of gray . <\s>
<s> And they can live with a lot of pets with just a little investment and be completely fused into the nature , because their life is totally without disturbance . <\s>
<s> For example , an old man can have a pet like a bird , go to the park for a walk every morning and spend most of the day with hsi peer friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another equally important point is that their life is quite joyful . <\s>
<s> They used to be prisoner of work and life , but now they are free and become the master of life . <\s>
<s> they can do everything they wished . <\s>
<s> Therefore , a mass of hobbies devloped and a lot dreams created when they are young can be downright enjoyed and fullfilled now . <\s>
<s> Taking travling all around the world as an example , a young man may found time , money and energy -- a mass of problems ---- to do so , while all that will be neglected by an older and just with an reasonable plan , the dreams is that easy to be realized . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What is more , they live in complete happiness and harmonies . <\s>
<s> Old people get the most profit and enjoyment from a big family because the young can not experience the feeling of looking at their offsprings ' growth and share their offspings ' successes . <\s>
<s> If you are still a youth , you will not now how happy an older people when he or she received a care or bless from his or her children ---- something that nothing can compare . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Admittedly , the young do have their advantages . <\s>
<s> They may have passion , enthusiasim and a mass of energy that the old do not poccess . <\s>
<s> However , in view with all the merits of the older people 's life , I really have my envy for their life which is that peaceful , joyful and full of happiness and harmonies and as a result , I will no longer being afraid of growing old . <\s>
<s> Enjoyment in life is basically dependent upon the positive aspects of thinking and the strong base a person is related to . <\s>
<s> It is not the outer showcase but it is ones innerself that provides an access to enjoy the situations coming to life As per me older people are more related to the positive aspects of life and they use to manage the phases of life in more balanced manner by provision of much needed charistmatic energy that flow in there life . <\s>
<s> and that provides them an access to enjoy there life fully In todays society for the young people it is believed that it is money which let them to enjoy the life . <\s>
<s> But it is not an actual souce to enjoy life Life is based on management of situations and that we get from an access of experience we had in past . <\s>
<s> So as per me the two major factors that effects the life are <\s>
<s> 1. Strong base to values <\s>
<s> 2. Experience <\s>
<s> So if we dont have a balance of values and experience we can manage a part of life but we cantlive our life truely and this will result on the way we enjoy . <\s>
<s> These two aspects are missing in major way from the living manner of young people and so we can very well account the result . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The situation of life provide an inspiration to enjoy our life so it is not the external comfort that we can manage from fullfilling our lavish requirement . <\s>
<s> That is generally thought by young people , So an inspiration to earn more and more and more money is the main reason that generally let the young people to focus upon that . <\s>
<s> As a result the time slip from there hand and once they realise that , they suffer So in order to enjoy life young people have to provide time to their ownself and manage the situations in a manner that they can Forcast the results as like older people in a manner to positively deal with these situations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So it is ones innerself that provides and directs a route to enjoy life As the older people generally stick to their way to enjoy life rather then getting dependent on and outside aspect ( money ) they are able to accoumplish the goals in a manner that provides a direct relation to enjoy their life in a better manner . <\s>
<s> I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Everything in the world is based on it 's own concept , no one can do things well except knowing the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The fact is based on the ideas and concept . <\s>
<s> You wo n't know the essential of things unless you try hard to understand its concepts . <\s>
<s> For example , when you are study a new word which you cannot see it straightly and it 's hard to find it out immidiately , the easiest and the fastest way to know it is to know its concept . <\s>
<s> If you think to see the fact is much more important , then you will spend a lot of time to find it out , so it 's not that convenient . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , to understand the concept of a thing is very important . <\s>
<s> When you study things as a student , you ca n't catch the real fact if you do n't know its idea . <\s>
<s> When you are reading a novel , you even ca n't catch the idea , you even do n't know what it is talking about , how can you image what 's the fact is like ? <\s>
<s> So , the idea is the basic thing for understanding . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And also , it 's really important for students to know the concept when they are learning acdemic courses at school . <\s>
<s> For example , in the study of Physics , it 's very easy to see the fact of any physical phonomena , but everyone know that how thing going , the point is to explain why it goes that way . <\s>
<s> So you need to resist the consepts of things based on again and again , then you can understand it and get learned . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Overall , the understanding of idea and concept are very necessary for us to understand . <\s>
<s> You may not really catch the real meaning by only seeing the facts , you need to understand the things in <\s>
<s> Nowadays , some successful people usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I totally agree with this point , and it is a good thing . <\s>
<s> following my discussion , you will see the reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , successful people should try to new things , because it is a big chanllenge for them . <\s>
<s> Although successful people already success , they sometimes need a bigger chanllenge and it will make them got a lot of good feeling , then they can continue to more successful step . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , it is ability that should to learn for successful people . <\s>
<s> Today , following Technology and Science 's development , more and more people succed , absolutely , it is very good thing for this time , but successful people should try new things and take risk and they should n't stop to the one thing . <\s>
<s> because as a successful people , they also have many stress in their life , so they should learn lots of ability and knowlege that they can not be lost by this world , otherwise , maybe one day , they will become a common person from a successful people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , take risks and try new things is a very helpful and useful thing for successful people . <\s>
<s> It is really ture that they should try it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well is a good thing . <\s>
<s> Travel is the most thing exsiting in our live . <\s>
<s> People who travel alone or groups is mazing and has advantiges and diesadvanteges . <\s>
<s> when you travel by alone that gave you more fredomes . <\s>
<s> On other hand , the travel with guide you have to listone to him all the time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , THE TAVEL IN GROUPE IS MORE SAVETY AND GOOOD TO EXPLEIN what you see and howyou feel . <\s>
<s> However , the travel alone gave you some thing of miss chanse and boreing . <\s>
<s> When you travel under guide that make you ask him if you do n't know any thing abuot some thing you pass it or see it . <\s>
<s> Sometime you tired from this person but you have to more pationt and also if that persone take every thing seriose and dose n't make joke or some thing funy Sacaned , the you the travel with groups you do n't know them and no leader that make the trip and the line of the travel is confused . <\s>
<s> For example , one time i travel with my friends to hunting and this sport is the famuse and lovely in my country . <\s>
<s> However , when the move we chose one leader and he was the best leader i see because he orgnize the trip and make every one happy . <\s>
<s> Formore the travel with gruops under led make the trip orgnized . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally , the traveling with groups make you contain every thing in that trip . <\s>
<s> In my opinion i prefer travel with gruop under one condetio they have leader all the trip to make this trip keep in the momeris and do n't forgot even this leader dose n't has ability to make this trip perfect . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end some people prefer travel under guide some ather not but still the travel the beautufil thing . <\s>
<s> There si always the same question between young and older poeple . <\s>
<s> Who enjoy life ? <\s>
<s> I am a young people and I can say that I enjoy the life more than my parents . <\s>
<s> But it is always true ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people just begening her life and want to profit from it . <\s>
<s> they do n't know about dead , about real succes or failure . <\s>
<s> They only see all the years coming . <\s>
<s> Usually they have a lot of projects and dreams and how to develop them . <\s>
<s> For example , I take me . <\s>
<s> I want to go to Australia in order to develop my english and I wish to find a good job and perhaps to stay overthere . <\s>
<s> I really do it and I will really do everything in order to succed . <\s>
<s> A lot of people say me that I am little crazy to do this with all danger . <\s>
<s> This argue come especially from adult over forty years old . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> While old people have a long life behin them , they have enjoyed life before and today they are in their habits . <\s>
<s> They have already enjoyed life , or perhaps not . <\s>
<s> I see it with my grandparents , they have had a other life , with the war and other truma . <\s>
<s> Today they do n't want to move . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And sometime it is in the other sense , in other words , young people do n't enjoy the life and older poeple do it . <\s>
<s> For example , young people find a job , take a flat , have their friends and do n't want something else ( this is my brother ) . <\s>
<s> Whereas older people always try to profit and take everything from life . <\s>
<s> I have a friend , who is over seventy years old , who travel all arround the world and try to enjoy all that she can . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , to my mind , I do n't know if we can speak about young or old people . <\s>
<s> Each person enjoy the life in her way and with her past . <\s>
<s> One enjoy life with their habits and other with their dreams and realisation . <\s>
<s> The issue of car number is very important because of environmental espects that are involved in this problem . <\s>
<s> On the one hand , we can thing that in twenty years there will fewer cars in use than today because of the limited energy sourves such as petroleum . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , people which consider developping country , or former developping country such as China or India can support the idea that the number of cars will increase . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , the number of cars will decrease in developped country as in Europ or north America but will increase in newly developped country as China . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , we have to condider that the whole world is changing because of the scarcity of energy that will be an very important issue in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> Actually , it will involve high prices for gazoline for example . <\s>
<s> For instance , people which does not need long travel by car will use other way to travel such as bike because cars will be too expensive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , we know the countries that use a lot of cars are the developped countries and now , new developped countries are coming and its inhabitants are going to be able to buy cars . <\s>
<s> Thus , car number can increase a lot during the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , my viewpoint is that there will be high difference in the car consumption between developped countries and countries like China or India where the number of cars is sharply increasing . <\s>
<s> Moreover , number of cars in more little asian countries is growing too . <\s>
<s> For instance , it is a new thai problem in Bangkok . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , it is difficult to answer and predict the car consumption in the worls that involve a lot of phenomena like energy availability or country developping but environmental problems are linked to car number and some law or regulation about environment may decrease the quantity of cars during the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> I do not agree or disagree with this particular statement becuase it totally depends on the idea that you have when you want to travel and also where you wish to go . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For me , when you 're younger you always looking for something new even if it gets a little too risky and sometimes that risk you are willing to take is the main attraction of the whole trip . <\s>
<s> If I want to know a city and if I have the time to do it the best way to explore every interesting corner , at least for me , is going directly to them instead of waiting for our turn in the tour route for that place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , knowing people of the place is much better than spend all day with other you dont like in the bus . <\s>
<s> I think is really a good expierence to be surrounded by peolpe with different cultures because you realize that we 're not so different in many ways it 's only matter of social beliefs the way we react in every situations of our lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The best thing of a group leaded by a tour guide is the time you save when someone who knows everything about the place you have visited is in your side . <\s>
<s> I mean you dont have to worry for the food , the hotel or the place you 'll use to rest , the places you have to go and all those things you have to know about the people , their languaje and their costums . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Maybe a group of friends on a trip can be the better way to travel to a new land for me and even if a tour guide is leadding us because Im not really looking to get lost in a city I dont even know , at least not for now or any soon . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statment that young poeple enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> I have some reasons to support my opinion . <\s>
<s> First , Young poeple is more energetic in any kind of activity than older people . <\s>
<s> Second , young poeple has more chances to study many subjects , for example in university or private school . <\s>
<s> Third , young people can make many friends and have many ecperiences in and out of the country . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young poeple is more energetic in many activities than old people . <\s>
<s> In general , old people has a lot of money to spend compared with young poeple especially those still studing in high school or university . <\s>
<s> Although old people might be able to get pension for sending money , they are too old to go out and do some activities in community . <\s>
<s> Or simply , they are too busy to take care the family or house . <\s>
<s> Young poeple is very active in many kind of activity . <\s>
<s> They join a tennis club , go to language school and do some volunteer work . <\s>
<s> If young people do n't have money , they normally earn money from part-time job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young poeple has more chances to study many subjects , for example in university or private school . <\s>
<s> In Japan , when you want to study in university , you have age limitation to be university students . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is also said that when you are young , it is more chances to remembrer and study well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people can make many friends and have many experiences in and out of country . <\s>
<s> Young people has more good accesses to meet many people . <\s>
<s> You can go to abroad , you can have good experiences . <\s>
<s> But when you get old , you tend to be stay home and watch TV whole day . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From above reasons , I agree with the satement that young poeple enjoy life more than old people do . <\s>
<s> In our society every person have their own way of thinking some think that it is important for students to understand ideas and concept while other prefer that it is important for students to learn facts . <\s>
<s> I agree , student should learn the concept and ideas first and then they should learn other things . <\s>
<s> if they does not able to learn ideas and concept then they will not able to learn other things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the student should learn the ideas and the concept of the particular topic . <\s>
<s> For instance , when teacher teach their student . <\s>
<s> teacher forces the student to learn first the concept of the topic she explained . <\s>
<s> Also after teching the topic teacher usually ask the student that whether the got the idea about what she taught and also asks them to explain what they learned . <\s>
<s> if the student was not able to understand about the idea of the topic , then he is not able to answer the question that the teacher asked him . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , In every field it is necessary to understand the idea and the concept . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally suppose for example , In science there are various laws which always has some concept for instance , about the gravitional . <\s>
<s> In the law of the gravitional force , the scientsist want to infer that , that law states some idea and the concept about the force . <\s>
<s> Same thing is there in the maths law is also based in some law and conceept which we apply later on for solving the problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , It is impossible for any student to learn fact without understanding the idea and the concept of the particular topic . <\s>
<s> I m working in the field of research where we have to first understand the ideas and the concept . <\s>
<s> Additionally when i was child one of the professor taught me first understand the idea and the concept of the topic when i was studying about the science , he also told me every topic is based on some iea or the concept . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , it is important for the every student to understand the idea and the concept of the topic , which will help them later in the future . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I have two reason . <\s>
<s> One reason is young people is always energetic and have excited thought of what they do and what they want to do in the future . <\s>
<s> Young people have a lot of things that they have not done yet . <\s>
<s> So they dream about the future evry day . <\s>
<s> I dream about what i want to do in the future all the time . <\s>
<s> I w And the other reason is that they have a lot of things that they should do in their youth . <\s>
<s> For example , study . <\s>
<s> Young peaple can lean fast than old people . <\s>
<s> My parents and teachers always say `` study hard when you are still young ! '' <\s>
<s> I think if we leaned a lot of thing in youth , we can live much better life in the future physical and mental . <\s>
<s> I like to learn new things . <\s>
<s> when I learn something new , I feel like I am getting smart and getting close to adults . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think old people enjoy life too , but I think old people did most exciting things when they were young . <\s>
<s> So they are now relaxing and having slow time with the partner watching the grand children growing and enjoying life . <\s>
<s> It is difficult to think that in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> First of all the car industry is strongly related to the petroleum industry , and they play such a strong role in the world 's economy ; i mean that there are too much interests of too much powerful people , so cars must be used to sell fuel that means petroleum . <\s>
<s> It is true that the worldwide transport communications have improved in the last years , a huge `` air traffic '' has taken place especially from the ` nineties , furthermore high speed trains have been created , even here in italy the government is about to creat a high speed line . <\s>
<s> And there are also other ways of transport , for example ships , metros and busses . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However in my opinion every man , every woman , prefer to move whenever they want and wherever they like without paying attention to reservate a ticket or arriving in time for the departure and whatever . <\s>
<s> And i am an example : i even cannot immagine to stay without my car , i need it for my job , i need it for my holidays and i can take it whenever i want without make a reservation and i am never in late , i mean that my car is `` always waiting for me '' . <\s>
<s> As we well know petroleum is going to the end , the reserves of these resource , called black gold , are almost to the end , i do n't know who will be playing the economic rules the next 20 years , but let 's thimk about hydrogen . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars working with hydrogen already exsist , but it is too much early to replace petroleum with hydrogen , for the reasons that i mentioned above . <\s>
<s> One thing is true : petrolemu will finish and so hydrogen working cars may will take place , and if not hydrogen , another alternative type of carburant , but it is in my opnion that cars will be much more than now <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that `` young people do not give enough time to helping their communities '' . <\s>
<s> Because in this modern world there are many things to concern with to them and the young people donot find time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The young people are most enthusiastic when they are doing some thing . <\s>
<s> Easpecially when they are spending their time for a variety of aspects , they may include studying , playing , watching the new vesions of films , listening music and to be say honestly they much inclined to enjoy themselves . <\s>
<s> Most of the young people are students . <\s>
<s> They do not find much time to think about community , their life goes through their studies . <\s>
<s> Most of the young people are ignoring the community due to their competion among themselves . <\s>
<s> At this era of their life they put more concentration for developing their future . <\s>
<s> They donot spend their time for thinking about community , also it is not possible for them to help the community at that time . <\s>
<s> Because every student is ruled by his or her parants . <\s>
<s> One may think that he or she can serve the people when they stand successfully in the socity . <\s>
<s> This may be the best time for any young person to think and serve there community . <\s>
<s> There are many young people who are mainly facing the problem of poverty , thay even cannot efford for their education , in such a way they are in capable of helping society . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to my opinion finally I can conclude that the age of the young people is the mainly and only cause that put them to ignore their community . <\s>
<s> Some people believe young people enjoy life more than older people do and others are not . <\s>
<s> I think I 'm person who believes young people enjoy life more than older people do for many reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , young people can work harder than old people . <\s>
<s> Young people can work any time and any place . <\s>
<s> Young people have more chance to work in differet places because most of the job needs young peole because they can do well but old people most of the time can not . <\s>
<s> As an example , I know two persons , one of them young and the other old . <\s>
<s> When they try to find a job the young man find a job easilly but the old man did not find a job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the young people can play many sports . <\s>
<s> Young people can play foot ball , basket ball and and different things . <\s>
<s> Young people have more vigor than old people , they can run and walk easier than old people . <\s>
<s> When you see the most sport games , you will see players which are young people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , young people can travle any place . <\s>
<s> Young people can travel to cold places or hot places because their health help them but old people are not . <\s>
<s> I know some young people travle many places and they enjoy and I know others old people can not travel to many places . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people really enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Young people can work hard , play many things and travle any place . <\s>
<s> I think most of old people want their young back . <\s>
<s> Recently , there is a heat debate on whether there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years . <\s>
<s> Some people hold the believe that the number of cars that we will use definitely will not decrease in light of the more competitive world that we will live in . <\s>
<s> They argue that cars are indispensable for our daily life if we want to be high efficient . <\s>
<s> However , as for me , it is no doubt that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> I uphold the opinion for the following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I think that people 's awareness on protecting the environment is improving . <\s>
<s> Through the mass medium , we can see the negative impacts brought about by our inappropriate treatment to the environment , for example , excessive car emission , which has a profound impact on the envrionment by polluting the air . <\s>
<s> I am convinced that people will gradually cultivate the sense of promoting the environment as long as they see the scence that animals are dying out due to the poisioning fumes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , with the progress of the scientific technologies , I firmly believe that new means of transportation will be invented to replace the cars that we are currently using . <\s>
<s> Owing to the fact that you can never predict what things might come into being , a tool that is emission-free and envrionment-friendly may be tapped in the next few seconds . <\s>
<s> From that moment , the number of cars in use will sharply decrease . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , in view of economic perspective , there have been already too many cars in use currently . <\s>
<s> According to a survey conducted by the Statistic Bureau of Shanghai , there will be only 1.2 % of the whole population who want to purchase cars in the next 5 years , which means the demand for cars almost achieves a saturation . <\s>
<s> People do not need cars any longer . <\s>
<s> Instead , they may long for having a plane for themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Up to a point , though some people insist that the there should be more cars in use than ther are today in the next twenty years , I consider the number of cars to be used will experience a decrease due to the improving awareness of people , new tool that might be brought by scientific technologies and the shrinking car demand . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is , whether there are more cars in use in twenty years than there are today or not . <\s>
<s> This issue is very important because of the global environmental pollution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I beliefe , that there will be much more cars in use in twenty years than there are today . <\s>
<s> There are several reasons why I state this meaning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At first , almost nobody who actually has a car will sell his or her car or reduce the numbers of cars or will change generally on the public traffic . <\s>
<s> Even if the car is crashed , people normally make it repared or buy a new one . <\s>
<s> The reason for this behavour is verz simple : people are comfortable . <\s>
<s> Using the car is the most comfortable way to move . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , China and India ( emerging market countries ) are countries with a huge citizenship . <\s>
<s> Actually , in these countries , there are not a lot of cars because most of the people living there have not enough money to purchase cars . <\s>
<s> These countries are emerging market countries , i.e. the economy in these countries will increase enormously . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the people will get richer and in some years , a huge number of Indian and Chinese people will have the ability to purchase cars . <\s>
<s> Even if a lot of Europeans and Americans change their behavour and get more sensible to the environmental problems arising out from the individual traffic and sell their cars or will not pruchase new ones , the number of cars will increase in the bext years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A third reason is the world economy . <\s>
<s> The production of cars is an important economy subject with al lot of employees . <\s>
<s> Futhermore , also the gaz industry is important . <\s>
<s> These two industries together will show that the number of cars will not decrease beacause of their business interest . <\s>
<s> They will also take influence on the politics that they can sell their cars and their gay cheaply ( e.g. no high taxes on these products ) . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As argued , I believe , that there will be more cars in use in twenty years than today . <\s>
<s> But I am also sure , that the cars will pollut the environment in twenty years not as much as today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In cinclusion , in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today , because of peoples behavour , the people in the emerging markets and the car and gaz industry . <\s>
<s> The tendency of the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' is right . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think so because I am a person who acts risky and I had always success . <\s>
<s> But before you generalize you have to know what risk means in this context . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Risk according to your carreer is to be brave to live and work or study in a foreign country for longer than 3 months . <\s>
<s> Risk in terms of success in my opinion is to apply for another job even you are happy and safe right now with your situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My risk started after I have finished my apprentenceship at Neuss County Council as an IT-Specialist . <\s>
<s> Working for a government facility is quite secure . <\s>
<s> The chance that you lose your job is low . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But I have thought that this cannot be everything in my life . <\s>
<s> I wanted to apply for a job in call center because I thought that talking to people might help my problem of communication . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I applied for the best call center in my region and I worked for Microsoft . <\s>
<s> Even now I am writing my thesis to graduate at Microsoft Germany . <\s>
<s> I also worked and studied one semester in the United States . <\s>
<s> The time scale here is approximately 10 months . <\s>
<s> My exchange semester in South Korea and my internship at the Korean German Chamber of Commerce and Industry was also a great experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If I review my journey right now and compare it to some friend who never left the city where we graduated high school I can definetaly say that I have an advanced status . <\s>
<s> The reason for this conclusion is because this friend of mine applyed for the same internship program . <\s>
<s> So the arguments are not only my thoughts but my experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally I my friend had to admit that I always have something to talk about . <\s>
<s> And we figured out that the more information you get the more opportunities you can turn into successful projects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Right now I am preparing to built up my own business because I have contacts worldwide . <\s>
<s> And not every person in the world likes to do business unpersonally with people through the internet . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So my understanding of risk is to try new things . <\s>
<s> Even if you are secure in your present situation . <\s>
<s> Taking risks is not always dangerous . <\s>
<s> You only have to evaluate the k.o. criterias which could be essential to have or to lose . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People who already have a family with wife and children are not flexibel because parents have to `` feed '' or take care for their family members . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As long as I am young I always will set new milestones to achieve my long-term goal to have a great life with my future family . <\s>
<s> And I also think it is more efficient to `` risk '' something when you are young rather when you have responsibility towards others . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I hope that this mind will have a great impact to my life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Good Luck ! <\s>
<s> SOME YOUNG PEOPLE DO ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DO . <\s>
<s> BUT THAT IS NOT 100 PERCENT CORRECT . <\s>
<s> SOME OF OLDER PEOPLE THEY WORKED SO HARD DURING THE YOUNG LIFE , THEY SPEND ALMOST MORE THAN 12 HOURS FOR WORK JUST WANT SAVE MORE MONEY FOR THE FUTURE OLD LIFE . <\s>
<s> THEY MIGHT PLAY AFTER RETIRED CAN AROUND THE WORLD USE THIS MONEY . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> MY FATHER WAS CRAZY OF WORK WHEN HE WAS YOUNG . <\s>
<s> HE WORKS ALMOST OVER 12 HOURS . <\s>
<s> HE GOT BACK HOME USUALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT FOR EVERYDAY . <\s>
<s> I EVEN DID NOT HAVE CHANCE TO TALK TO HIM . <\s>
<s> NOW HE IS RETIRED HE TOOK MY MOM TRAVEL A LOT OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES . <\s>
<s> MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS WERE JELOUS OF THEM . <\s>
<s> IN CHINA , OLD PEOPLE SAID `` IF YOU NOT WORK SO HARD WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG , YOU WILL GET REGRATED . '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> MY PARENTS ALWAYS TOLD ME `` YOU HAVE TO MORK HARDER WHEN YOU HAVE ENERGE BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE . '' <\s>
<s> BUT THIS WORDS NOW IS CHANGE TO UES IN THE YOUNG PEOPLE . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> NOWADAYS SOME YOUNG PEOPLE JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN IN THIS WORLD . <\s>
<s> THEY WEST TIME AND MONEY IN PLAYING AND DOING NOTHING . <\s>
<s> WHEN THEY HAVE NO MONEY THEY ASK THEIR PARENTS TO GET . <\s>
<s> IF YOU ASK THEM WHY DO NOT YOU WORK ? <\s>
<s> THEY WILL TELL YOU `` LIFE IS SHORT , YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN FOR TOMORROW SO JUST ENJOY YOUR LIFE DO NOT BE SO SERIOUS AND DO NOT NEED TO WORK SO HARD . '' <\s>
<s> MY FATHER 'S CO-WORKER HAS A SON . <\s>
<s> HE DID NOT GO TO COLLEGE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL HE JUST STAY AT HOME AND PLAYING COMPUTRT GAME UNTIL NOW HE IS 27 YEARS OLD . <\s>
<s> HE NEVER WORK . <\s>
<s> THE RESION IS HE THINK HIS FAMILY DO NOT NEED TO WORK TO MAKE MONEY SO HE RATHER STAY AT HOME ENJOY HIS COMPUTER GAME LIFE . <\s>
<s> IT IS NOT CALLED ENJOY LIFE . <\s>
<s> I THINK SOME OF THEM CALLED ENJOY LIFE JUST GET LAZY , THEY DO NOT WANT THEMSELVES SO TIRED . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I CAN NOT SAY YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE THAT IS DEPENDS ON THE PERSON , JUST DO NOT WEST THE TIME TO DOING NOTHING . <\s>
<s> TIME IS MONEY . <\s>
<s> Well i m not in favor with the statment given aside . <\s>
<s> As we know that for gracping or for understanding any kind of topic , we should rather must go through the both phases of study . <\s>
<s> namely first one theoritical phase and second one is practical phase . <\s>
<s> In school level student only follow the way that they had been describe in books means they only aware with theoritical aspects of topic . <\s>
<s> i believe that text books are main media or way to providing thorough knowledege about concepts and aspects . <\s>
<s> But it is failuer to teach practical aspects of the perticular topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students can understand the ideas or concepts of any field by merely reading the topic in textbooks or by learning it in to classroom . <\s>
<s> so i think such student dose not have ability to explain or to demonstrate the concepts or in other way they dose not understand the fundamental principals behind the topic . <\s>
<s> while mere reading and understanding topic helps in assuming percpetivness of topic . <\s>
<s> although only reading dose not satisfy the requirements of best student , while he must go through second phase of study . <\s>
<s> if the student have clear theoritical concept of any specific topic then he or she can work or handel the problems related practically . <\s>
<s> for example one chemical engineer student have only school degree while othe have therotical base with experinced in that field . <\s>
<s> then in such case most of the chemical companies will hire the experienced student as he has better knowledge than inexperienced student . <\s>
<s> becose company alwayes looking for those persons who have peculiar charcteristics of both theoritical and practical sense . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By learning actual facts or getting practical training he will feel more satiate . <\s>
<s> as once in trainee period he has creates his ability to find the economically and ecofriendly solutions to the problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus finally i believe that it not only essential to understand the facts about any gernarl topic by reading or listing but also it will also flourish with actual practice on the field in kind of field . <\s>
<s> I disgree with the given statement because i think it depends on individual and not on the time available . <\s>
<s> A person who really wants to help his community can surely take out time for the same whereas a person who is not that interested will use his time for other purpose rather than serving his community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> No doubt that in the present generation the competition has increased and inorder to lead a resonablly good life people we really need to work hard . <\s>
<s> So in running after making penny people are overlooking the need for sparing time for working for the community . <\s>
<s> But still its not true that people dont give enough timefor community . <\s>
<s> For example , recently mumbai encountered a bomblast where thousands of people were injured . <\s>
<s> Then immediately people reacted and started helping the government in moving the injured people to the hospitals and geting their treatment done . <\s>
<s> A group of students took shifts for whole night and served the injured with bread and tea . <\s>
<s> I think this showsw the concern left in people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Donating money for development of poor people is also one way of serving the comunity . <\s>
<s> Because of the vast destruction of psunami many people were left with starving stomachs . <\s>
<s> In many colleges people collected money food , clothes and gave it to the government for sending them to the required places . <\s>
<s> Serving community not only means that you have to take fixed amount of time separately for it . <\s>
<s> I think helping the people where ever you find them is also serving . <\s>
<s> For exapmle , when we are on the way to office and come across a blind person struggling to cross the road helping him will also serve the purpose . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In short for serving community we need not be the active participants . <\s>
<s> Seeing the people reaction in such cases like psunami and the bomb blasts i think young spirits are still burning . <\s>
<s> I agree that students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> It is that this statement is for students . <\s>
<s> Do you think about it that if students does n't like study for themselves . <\s>
<s> It makes big problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , If students does n't understand or misunderstand , it makes to go wrong way to students . <\s>
<s> Students want to know knew impormations , but they do n't understand well about knw impormations . <\s>
<s> So , they need teacher who makes to understand them . <\s>
<s> If it does n't important for students , students do n't have attention . <\s>
<s> so they become that they does n't like attention about new ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , They want to interesting study . <\s>
<s> If students does n't understand ideas , it is that their class is not interesting to them . <\s>
<s> I experience about that , too . <\s>
<s> When I was highschool student , I do n't like English because my English teacher alway hit me with my grade . <\s>
<s> I want to study English but my teacher did n't . <\s>
<s> He always do quizes and tests and he hit me with their grades . <\s>
<s> I think it is problem that it is exept to understand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , in school , students wnat to play without study . <\s>
<s> Because their subjects are without understanding . <\s>
<s> For example , Korea has many academies for that they help students can go unversity . <\s>
<s> Academies teach interesting more than schools . <\s>
<s> And they teach fast more than schools . <\s>
<s> So , schools are bouring to students . <\s>
<s> Students always sleep in school and after school , they study hard in academy . <\s>
<s> It is wrong education system , In conclution , understanding is important more than learn facts for students . <\s>
<s> It will decide their futures and contries destinies . <\s>
<s> We offer for their futures . <\s>
<s> It is that our future become to go good way . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students than learning facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If a student invests his time to understand the basal ideas and concepts on a matter rather than just learning the facts he can use these in similar subjects . <\s>
<s> Generally humans tend to do just as much as neccesary to solve a problem they faced . <\s>
<s> So many students are just learning the facts to pass exams . <\s>
<s> But they often seemed to forget the importance of ideas . <\s>
<s> As an example in my first year in mechanical engineering I learned in my material sciences course not only the facts or calculations for the exam . <\s>
<s> I used very much time to understand the consepts of structure of materials . <\s>
<s> After I passed the exam that I could really understand the basics of solid mechanics and it helped me very much for my preparation time for this course . <\s>
<s> I have seen that my investment really paid back . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In other hand the concepts or ideas are more likely to be reminded in later years . <\s>
<s> The learned facts can replaced by new ones and you could not remind them even after some days . <\s>
<s> As we are students and learning the subjects to use them we have to call them whenever we need . <\s>
<s> For example I have been a very good student in high school and especially in physics . <\s>
<s> After I begin with the university I have seen that I could not remind some formulas in physics which I used to know . <\s>
<s> But with my understanding for physics helped me to derive them for very basic formulas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence when trying to learn a subject it better to use more time for understanding then just learning facts . <\s>
<s> `` successful people try to new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , I agree with this statement because that the person cannot get success without doing new things . <\s>
<s> If he do the same thing that already done there is no anything special between the others and the successfull person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I strongly agrre with this statement . <\s>
<s> Example in our country there is one successfull person in the bussiness that he created many revolutions in the bussiness system . <\s>
<s> He is the one of the gretest person 's in our country . <\s>
<s> He use to do the new things istead of doing the same things . <\s>
<s> He started with small firm and developed many types of products , He was not satisfied with the bussiness with the same products he strated many types of bussiness in different feilds and established a big group of companies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> He is very successful person in that feild eventhough he was ot satisfied with that . <\s>
<s> He use to invent new one and start that firm , With that capability he started many small products and became a successfull person . <\s>
<s> He started many firms in all feilds like in the feild cell phones , petro chemicals , cotton firms and finance groups and got success . <\s>
<s> He is not satisfied with that same bussiness he wants to invent somany things mean the new things by that he became a successful person . <\s>
<s> He also took somany risks to get succeed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I conclude that it is correct statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well '' . <\s>
<s> By using the above examples i can state that the person should have guts to start the bussiness in other feild rather than in the same feild he known well , It is also a risk to do new things but eventhough they know it is risk they use to do the new things that is the successfull person 's secret to success in life . <\s>
<s> Traveling by group is an exciting experience due to you can meet new people apart from meeting the plac that is being visited , in my case I agree this statement because 3 years ago I had the oportunity to travel with a group of girls from my same age , and it just was an experience that i will never forget , meeting people of different places , is quite nice , but it is better to enjoy a trip or a certain place with another people , being led by a guide is very important when do you really whant to know about a place , its culture , its people , and this kind of things , it also is interesting to visit places that are only known by this kind of people . <\s>
<s> Its very enjoyable having a person who can answr to all of the doubts or questions that that you have about certain places , things , culture or history of the city or country that is being visited . <\s>
<s> If the porpouse of your trip is of getting relax and get appart from people , it is better to take that trip alone , ad to discover and solve the doubts about the place alone , due to is tru that for reflexing and having peace there is nothing better than being alone , or with your family , without strange people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my personal opinion i prefer to travel by group meeting people and being led by a tour guide , which can solve my doubts and can teach me more about the place , can give me an advice about what can be done or what can ot be done in that place , which restaurant is better and so on , also when im going in a relaxing plan with my family or alone it is better to being led by a guide because of tha same reason that I expesed before . <\s>
<s> The better advice that can be done to a traveler is to enjoy the trip alone or in goroup , being led by a guide or not , there is nothing better than meeting new places and new cultures , due that kind of experiences are printed on memory during long time . <\s>
<s> There are a diferents situation that successful people trying new things , and successful people who do not tried . <\s>
<s> I think that successful people always try new things because they try to success in diferents aspects but I think this is not correct . <\s>
<s> Obviusly that if you want to be succes first you have to know well what you have to do it . <\s>
<s> In this circunstance you will have to have a good preparation in the aspect or in the situation that you want to success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example I want to success in my career I am a lawyer and I wanto to be a well know lawyer in my country in that circunstances I know that I have to work very hard to do it , no trying new things just doing what I really know and doing well the tings that I really know in this way I sure that I wiil success . <\s>
<s> Because if you tried to succes doing new things I think sometimes you can doing something that is nor correct or bad things it does not matter your intention , the things is that that you have to be sure what you are doing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my specific case I can not try to do new things becuase I am a lawyer and I was prepare for a specific area that is Commercial and Civil Law , and I was study a lot about this subject , and I really honest with me and with my clients when someboy ask me if I can help them with other area such as criminal law , human right or enviromental law , that are very interesting but I do not know anytihing about and them and is not correct for me to tell that this area that mention above I know and help them becuase in this way I will never success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I think a reall successful people just do it what they already know . <\s>
<s> I am not agree with this statement becuase you can not tried new things if you do not well what you are doing . <\s>
<s> Always in better to grow up carefully taking all the value that it is neccesary . <\s>
<s> And doing well what you really know . <\s>
<s> Young people seemed have everything becouse they are young and they have energy for doing anything , so it seemed like older people have finished to enjoy their life along thier age . <\s>
<s> Also , it sounds that young people have much more ambitious than older people , in fact , it must be misunderstand . <\s>
<s> It can not say that young people enjoy life more than old people becouse both ages have advantage and disadvantage , also older people might enjoy life more than young people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , as I mentiond before , an advantadge of young people is their age . <\s>
<s> They have a lot of time and long distance for the end of their life . <\s>
<s> It is certainly the advantage of young people which older people do not have . <\s>
<s> Howevver , young people do not have enough money even if they had time and ambitious for their plan for enjoying life . <\s>
<s> Therefore , young people should not only think about enjoying life with plans also need to work on their job for getting money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , although older people actually have less time than young people , it means that old people have been working for getting money . <\s>
<s> Hence , they have enough money for enjoying their plan . <\s>
<s> They have almost same ambitious as young people have . <\s>
<s> Besides , they have a great experience of enjoying life through their working life . <\s>
<s> There have not been only interesting experience , also some bad or miserable experience . <\s>
<s> However , it can be a part of enjoying their life as well . <\s>
<s> Here is the biggest diference between young people and older people . <\s>
<s> So , I think that older people are enjoying much more than youngers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , enjoyment of life is related to its age , and I disagree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' <\s>
<s> . <\s>
<s> Both young and older people have the advantages and disadvantages . <\s>
<s> Learning facts are important as well as learning and understanding idea and concepts . <\s>
<s> But I strongly agree with this statement on how important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . <\s>
<s> That is because if students learn the idea and understand the concept that means they can use those idea as some kind of example to solve an answer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , students can learn about fact , but when it is time for them to use what they have learned like tests or in some kind of social events , even if they know about the fact they wo n't be able to solve those problems . <\s>
<s> In math tests students need to know how the procedure works in order to solve for the answer . <\s>
<s> But what if students know only the facts ? <\s>
<s> `` Division was discovered by ... <\s>
<s> etc . '' <\s>
<s> These kind of facts wo n't help students to score well on their tests . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If students learn only facts , they wo n't be able to make their own hypotenuse or to learn how to study new enviornments by themsleves . <\s>
<s> Most college professors learned the basic , in this case the idea and concept of how the things work out and why they got that solution . <\s>
<s> If they did n't learn the idea and concept of what they learned and only learned the facts , they would n't have any idea what their doing during their new experiments or researchs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Learning new facts are waste of time . <\s>
<s> People can learn facts while they learn and study idea and concepts . <\s>
<s> Reason why that is possible is that because through learning idea and concepts people can end up learning few or more of new facts from their experiences . <\s>
<s> So if students understand idea and concepts that means they are learning facts alone and without teachers yelling at them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When teachers teach students the idea and concepts more than facts , students will probably do better in academically and socially . <\s>
<s> That is why I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Some people think that to study many academic subjects for getting borad knowledge is better than to concentrate on one specific subject . <\s>
<s> However , I do not agree the opinion and think that people getting a specialized knowledge will be beneficial to our society as follow reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , our society , recently , should get the human resources getting a specialized knowledge in many areas such as technology , economy and policy . <\s>
<s> Because unprofessional people can lead the society - country , company , party etc. - to the miserable status . <\s>
<s> The negative results of companies operated by unprofessional owners can be a good sample . <\s>
<s> For example the Korean famous corporation ` Daewoo ' got the bankruptcy some years ago , because the owner ignore the advice of professional staffs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At seccondly , the modern society has expanded its area . <\s>
<s> So the society has been detailed and needs the people suitable for each area . <\s>
<s> Especially , the modern corporations have so much departments for improving the efficiency . <\s>
<s> For example , most companies divede the department such as administration , accounting , human resources , general support and production . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this case , companies should employee people who can use the specialized knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At third , if necessary , there are other ways to grow broad knowledge after becoming the specialist in specific area . <\s>
<s> The community activity and interaction with people in other area will be effective way . <\s>
<s> So many companies hire specialists and give them opportunities to experience other area for growing people who are able to control the overal companies <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I cannot agree that to study many academic subjects for getting borad knowledge is better than to concentrate on one specific subject , considering the above reasons . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , in the near future less cars will be used compared to what is used today . <\s>
<s> Several reasons can contribute to having this opinion . <\s>
<s> I think the technological advances that are going on in othe transportation vehicles will decrease the number of cars being used . <\s>
<s> For example . <\s>
<s> Trains in Japan and Germany are becoming very fast and I think in the futute they will compensate for the time it takes to reach to the train stations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Goverments will announce new laws prohibiting a single person to use a car . <\s>
<s> Already in certain cities , only cars with more than one passenger are allowed to use the fastest lane . <\s>
<s> This , to encourage people to travel in groups . <\s>
<s> The reasonable development of such laws is that statement mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Home will be the center of all activities is another reason I would like to mention . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , many people work at home . <\s>
<s> All the needed entertainment can become available at home . <\s>
<s> Morever , food , from restaurants and grocery shops , is being delivered up to your door . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Car models are becoming very similar in appearance and options . <\s>
<s> A very good example is the Honda Accord and Hyundi Sonata , it is hard to differentiate between them form outside . <\s>
<s> At the end , this will lead to only one company selling cars . <\s>
<s> Cars will have less appeal to rich people and they will stop buying cars and start buying hovercraft vehicles or any other transporation devices . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , cars will become dispensible as less cars will be in use . <\s>
<s> Hopefully , instant travel , which we read about in science fiction novels , will be invented in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> I disagree because traviling with a group led by a tour guide is a <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> bad idea for my thinking . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First when someone is travilng with a group led by a tour guide , it <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> makes him or her being controlled , so he or she ca n't have the ability to move freelly . <\s>
<s> For example , if someone needs to go to the <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> restroom , every one should wite for that person until he or she <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finishes . <\s>
<s> And also if someone does n't like the place or has been to <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the place that group are going to , he or she should go with the group . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason is that travilng with a group could be <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> unhealthy in someone 's health . <\s>
<s> When someone travels with a group , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> he or she may have healthy problems that could transfear to <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> someone in the group . <\s>
<s> For example , if someone has Inflo , it can <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> transfear ( go ) to someone in the group easlly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The third reason that when someone is traviling with a group the <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> travel based on a plan . <\s>
<s> When a group travels , it has a ready plan . <\s>
<s> So , when <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> someone wants to change his mind about a place , he ca n't change <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the plan he should go with the plan or leave the group after paying <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> some money . <\s>
<s> For example , if someone changes his mind about <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> visitng a musume with the group , he ca n't change the plan from <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> visiting the musume to visit the zoo . <\s>
<s> So he should go with the group <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> by rhe plan or leave the group after paying some money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , as you see , traviling with a group is a bad idea because <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> of the ability of moving , the health and changing the mind . <\s>
<s> I think <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> when someone wants to travel , he or she should go by themselvs . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement because people who takes risks and i f try new things has more chance catch the success rather than the other people who lives with the things that they already know . <\s>
<s> Expanding the limits and discover new areas is so important . <\s>
<s> If person has a tentance to take risk will realise that it is worthed to take risk although there is a chance to fail . <\s>
<s> Successful people who try new things are more unbeatble and stronger than the others . <\s>
<s> They have more reasons to live and taking risks makes them exited and ambitious . <\s>
<s> When they reach their goals they become a person who is happy to live and who feels alive . <\s>
<s> After exploring new things it becomes an addiction and they want more new things and more risks . <\s>
<s> If i would give an example from an artist , for to be successful he \ she needs to learn new things and follow the improvements around his world . <\s>
<s> Those exploratons and experimentations opens a new worlds of creativity . <\s>
<s> artist should be open to the whole universe after that he can create an uniqe work of art . <\s>
<s> They should take risks to discover his limits and to develop his abilities and skills . <\s>
<s> For example there is an performance artist on stage and he needs to be brawe enough to prfor his show he should take risk without thinking what does the auidience thiks or reacts . <\s>
<s> He should try new things on stage with combining his exprience and knowledge . <\s>
<s> Think that he tried and had good reaction from auidience or they did n't like the show . <\s>
<s> His benefit here is this ; he discovered his limits next time he will be more exprienced than before . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Those are the essential steps for to be a succesful person . <\s>
<s> You need to try new things and take risks and expand your limits for to feel alive and happy . <\s>
<s> iam absoultely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and iam sure that this is true because i find my self happier when i was younger than this moment for the following factors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> firs of all , when i was young i never thought about the toughness of the future and what i should and i should not do . <\s>
<s> for example when i was younger i was like to play with lego but now my look from the people eyes will be so different than past that they would criticise me and maybe they would insult me by doing that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> moreover , it was less responsibility that my goal was only paying and playing but now i have to think about my foot steps and the result of my step . <\s>
<s> forexample , i have to decide which university i will enroll and which feild i have to go and how to make a privilaged life with great fortune . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> what is more , i can see the world by simple eyes when i was young . <\s>
<s> forexample when i see the enemy and the invasion in my country or neighbored country i say that i can solve the problem and be like superman but this time i afraid to either think about that thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> the range of entairtanment when i was young more than now . <\s>
<s> forexample i was visiting my friend and watch tv and playing electronic games like playstation but now i tell my self i must not to waste my time by these silly things and think about such as the project that my teacher wants from me . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> to sum up my essay i think that the statement is difinetly true that young people will enjoy life more than older people do but i have to admit that being mature and man who is dependable has agreat constructive points in my life such as getting the freedom . <\s>
<s> Although being polyvalent is a good thing because you are able to discuss about everything , being specialized in one specific subject is more valuable to me . <\s>
<s> Indeed , in my opinion , when you are able to be the best in one specific subject it means that you can focus very hard on something in a way to do your best . <\s>
<s> That 's the most important . <\s>
<s> People who have a little knowledge of a lot of things are common persons . <\s>
<s> Being specialized in one topic is very important because it 's a way to make yourself different . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Being good at ease on several subjects is common nowadays . <\s>
<s> You are not efficient when you are know a little of severals topic because your mind is not focus on something that you can do , or explain better than everything . <\s>
<s> Even if you have an important knowledge of several topics , you are not able to be as good , in your argument , as someone who is very good in one subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , being very good in one subject means being weak in other topics . <\s>
<s> Because you spend most of your time in studying ( or working ) the same thing , you do n't open your mind to other things , or do n't even being interested in doing something else because you know that you wo n't be able to be as good as you are in your specialisation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Anyway , if your are able to focus yourself to only one thing , it means that you can focus on anything . <\s>
<s> Being well focus on something is one of the most important thing nowadays : in work , studies .. <\s>
<s> anything . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To me , you are more efficient when you are able to forget everything around you except the thing you are doing . <\s>
<s> As an example let 's take the car . <\s>
<s> If you are focus when you are driving , if you are not changing the radio or dialling a number on your cellphone , nothing can happen even if a other car arrives very fast from anywhere . <\s>
<s> Because being focus on something means control it . <\s>
<s> I 'm agree with this statement for many reasons . <\s>
<s> In twenty year , or maybe in less year , there will be a decrease of car 's number . <\s>
<s> First of all there are too many cars in our city and in many vehicles there is only one person , I hope that in future will be fewer cars because people will understand how use cars . <\s>
<s> For example , I live in milan , my city is a very big city and it is very easy see how many are cars on our streets . <\s>
<s> I think that , if people want it , it is possible that in one cars there are 2 , 3 or 4 person , in this way there will be not some traffic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In second way there is a problem about petroleum and this element can change the approach that person have with their car , the huge cost of petroluem can limit the use and in consequence the number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover there is the problem of pollution , cars came out many toxic substances and in future will be necessary change about motors and , if it will be not possible , we can obbligatory decrease number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I 'm very interesting about this argoument because I study chemical engeneer and many of my courses speak about how it is possible reduce the amount of pollution or how it is possible find a new way for move respect of the use of car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end I 'm agree with the statement : in few years the number of cars will decrease even if people think that cars are necessasry . <\s>
<s> I think so for problem correlate with use of car but also because I hope in new technology . <\s>
<s> In fact it is possible that in future , not too far , there will be more efficace , more beautiful and user vehicles than cars . <\s>
<s> There are people who thinks the perfect way to travel is alone without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> However , I disagree with theirs opinion . <\s>
<s> I belive The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Becase by a tour guide , I can see more detail about the specific place and It makes not time comsuming . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , with tour guide , I can get more impotant and detail information what I wanted . <\s>
<s> Becase of guide 's explation , many people feel thier travel is more bountiful than alone trip without guide . <\s>
<s> For example , last summner , I went to Kyungok-gung which was the Place of Choson-dinesty in Korea . <\s>
<s> first time , I went around alone . <\s>
<s> However , I found a group with a guide . <\s>
<s> Soon , I participated in this group , I heard about many information of this Place more specific . <\s>
<s> After tour , I could learn about my nation 's Place and had more pride of my country . <\s>
<s> From a tour guide , travel makes more plentiful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Next , Tour guide go around important places and specifics cites . <\s>
<s> It can reduce time consuming . <\s>
<s> When I had Europe travel alone , I was very confuse be <\s>
<s> Nowadays , there are some kind of ways to learn something which have never taken before in personal . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement which is more effective to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . <\s>
<s> People should face to the facts what would have more Important things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , it is no doubt about that facts are composed by real thing . <\s>
<s> Most of them have records or certifications in several ways , writing , taking photos , painting , or existing substance itself like a fossil . <\s>
<s> There are obvious no assumptions and personal opinions in the facts . <\s>
<s> Besides , facts would not change the their form because they can not be made by human thoughts . <\s>
<s> For example , earth is existing on solar system , it is fact . <\s>
<s> But some people had ideas earth is just existing own , no system , in ancient world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , ideas and concepts are based on facts . <\s>
<s> If there are no facts , ideas and concepts can not be born . <\s>
<s> People tend to add to some thoughts in their own way on the fundamental , facts . <\s>
<s> In the other words , facts bring the human thoughts , ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> In conclusion , facts have some more advantages for the study than ideas and concepts that I have shown the above . <\s>
<s> There is no possibility the existense ideas and concepts without facts . <\s>
<s> People are doing things in different way and they learn new things and face the consequences from that things . <\s>
<s> Different people are doing in different manners . <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people are doing what they know and how to do well . <\s>
<s> These people are not taking any advices from other people . <\s>
<s> Those people are not fairly success in their careers . <\s>
<s> But successful people are always trying new things and take risks from that and get well on that . <\s>
<s> For example successful people are always trying the new things and take risks from that experience and from that experience they will try again and finally they succeed on that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some times these people are trying new things and risks are more from that . <\s>
<s> These risks are some times giving the negative results and will give the negative consequences also . <\s>
<s> But these consequences will give the good lesson for doing again that experiment . <\s>
<s> They know the where it is the mistake and where it is correct for getting the good results . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> For example i have seen one of my professor he was doing always the new crossings in different crops . <\s>
<s> He always try to do that which characters are crossed with characters and how it improve the yield parameters in that crops . <\s>
<s> He always try this crossings and face some of the risks in that crossing programmes and finally his release the varities of Rice . <\s>
<s> From this onwards i thought successful people are always trying new things and face the riska and finally they get on well that experiments . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I hold this point of view because of the surging of the global population , the expansion of the urban cities , and the research of the invention of future cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , it is clear that the number of the global population is dramatically increasing by looking at the demographic charts . <\s>
<s> The number of people may soon reach its peak and it means that there will be more and more people that their transportational necessaries should to be met . <\s>
<s> And it can also observed that in many prosperous areas , one family may have more than a car in their garages . <\s>
<s> So the accelarating of the number of human will result in the intense need of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , since there are more and more fellow men who settle down and pursue their lives in cities , the brink of cities have extended , forming the so-called metropolis and this phenomanon shows that many people dwelling in the outskirts or suburbs of urban cities will need cars to access the core area of cities due to the distances from outer places to the business or entertainment centers and the convenience that cars bring about . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , because of the exhausion of the fossil fules , many scientists or coporations are now eager to research in the field of renewable energy and seek to invent environmentally friendly green cars that utilize bioenergy , electricity or solar energy . <\s>
<s> Since the further research and the actively invetion of green car , how can the number of cars be decreasing in twenty years . <\s>
<s> Accordingly , there will be more and more cars on the roads , no matter what appearances they may have . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a whole , in twenty years there wo n't be fewer and fewer cars in use . <\s>
<s> Conversely , what with the explosion of the global population , the swelling of the big cities and the enthusiasm for producing future vehicles , cars will still on demand . <\s>
<s> To Do or NOT TO DO ?? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In our lifes we drop in many unintended situtations . <\s>
<s> We try to solve many times and go on at the same point to do the best . <\s>
<s> Or most of us keep to do the best thing we could do without taking risks but we know that we would do it well . <\s>
<s> Ca n't we face our worsts when we wanted ? <\s>
<s> Is the matter to show what best you do or what you can do ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Everything starts with ourself in our mind with being generous and brave to life . <\s>
<s> Maybe we strongly need to be more different not to according to ur confessions , according what we need to do . <\s>
<s> If you say that it 's far away from me to change your same way sometimes and to open new doors to yourself what you are able to do , now it should be the time to show your abilities without any fair but with taking risks and bad results . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Everytime you want to see good answer after doing something ? <\s>
<s> How much will it satisfy you ? . <\s>
<s> You must do the things what you cant be able to do and need to take risks when you built your own chart . <\s>
<s> As if you think that you cant do the things which seem bigger . <\s>
<s> Unless you dont try to do new things and taste the bad things , you cant get the best one , You just get it as it satisfied you or you are supposed to do . <\s>
<s> Sometimes all of us need change and get some experinces from all the thing what goes on our life . <\s>
<s> You need to be curious to reach the point where you can be , you need to try and understand which you dont know how to it well . <\s>
<s> Absolutely It will add you many things as you faced your capabilities . <\s>

<s> Dont wait the time or dont wait it to come in front of you . <\s>
<s> You go and keep it without any suspections and obsessions . <\s>

<s> Some people prefer to learn knowledge of one specific subject as they think to study lot of subjects is time consuming . <\s>
<s> However , I think to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial for the people . <\s>
<s> As the subjects are little bit connected one another , it will be helpful to learn other subjects . <\s>
<s> Also , the more subjects someone have , the more choices can get in choosing majors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , subjects are conntected one another . <\s>
<s> It can make people to learn lot of subjects . <\s>
<s> For example , if I have to solve math problems , I have to learn both English and Mathematics . <\s>
<s> That is because I have to understand what the problem requires and to learn how to solve it . <\s>
<s> It means that even if I have little knowledge of many subjects , if I have chance to learn one specific subject , I can learn more effectively because I have basics of the subject . <\s>
<s> However , in case of studying one subject , one have to learn only the subject he/she choose and if one wants to learn other subject , he/she have to learn it from the basic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , people can get broad choice in majoring . <\s>
<s> As one have lots of knowledge , he/she has to choose what subjects specially interested in . <\s>
<s> For example , in case of studying one specific subject such as music , person only have choice to choose music major . <\s>
<s> However , in case of learn lots of subjects , I can have many choices in majors . <\s>
<s> Also , if someone has problems of majoring specific subject , he/she can transfer to the subject that he/she learned . <\s>
<s> In case of studying specific subject , it can not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For the reasons I mentioned , I want to suggest people to have broad knowledge of academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Because It can give people to learn lot of subjects and people can get lot of choices in choosing majors . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement because of several reasons . <\s>
<s> It is very casaul and normal to not help their communities in this society . <\s>
<s> As our society is getting more comlex and busy , we can not care evry sigle things . <\s>
<s> It is very true that people do not give a enough tension to the communitis , but I do not think it is bad at all . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The following statement mentions that young people specially , why is that ? <\s>
<s> Do you think old people give more time to helping communities ? <\s>
<s> I do not think so . <\s>
<s> As I said before , this is dog-eat-dog society . <\s>
<s> Even children have no much time to play , they are very busy to learn everything they can . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , each family members do not know about what their family do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , from the statement , it says ' do not give enough time ' . <\s>
<s> I am sure they are so many good people in this world and try to help the commuity out . <\s>
<s> I know some people who really do that . <\s>
<s> They do help them out because of not they have less busy time . <\s>
<s> As we know , a lots of people help thier communities . <\s>
<s> They have to satisfiy with that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Me as a represant from all young people in the world . <\s>
<s> We have so much big dream and big list of what we want to do . <\s>
<s> Our brains move to think even we are in bed . <\s>
<s> But the problem is the world is not give us enough time to do all . <\s>
<s> so we have to select a one thing to do . <\s>
<s> What i say is we are still trying to find that last selction . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To get enough attension from people , especially young people is too much . <\s>
<s> It is not beacuse we do not want to help them , it is only beacuse we are deadly busy to do other thing . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , the world develops very quickly , the knowledge becomes more and more important . <\s>
<s> Although the specific skill is need and society ca n't develop without majory people , broad knowledge also take a very high position in our life , study and work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , broad knowlkedge of many academic subjects are used widly in our daily lives . <\s>
<s> Take a easy thing for example , when you get up in the morning , you must use your weather knowledge , if you see the black cloud around the sky you will know it will rain , though it is a little thing , it really uses the knowledge you had from the book . <\s>
<s> I have a friend who is good at mathmaticth , but when I across the road with her , she catch me tirdly , because she does n't have traffic knowledge and ca n't accross the road . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Morever , the broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects are used in our studys , for instance , we will reaserch a flower we should learn the botonay of the flower and also may the physic of it , in addion we can use a poet to describ the flower . <\s>
<s> we ca n't think things only with one methord , this maks us wrong somethimes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is very importan in our work . <\s>
<s> Thery used a man who is good at business subject and has done a lot of good case . <\s>
<s> once the campany askde him to sell numbers of air conditions , he was very happy about the good selling in north because of the cold , so he went to south of china to sell them , but he sold none at last since the south of china remain 25 degree all of the year . <\s>
<s> so why the man fail at this case ? <\s>
<s> That 's because the lack of the geography knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the specialize in one specific subject is very improtant , or we can set rock to the space , Edison ca n't invented the lights , people ca n't use the computers . <\s>
<s> But to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is really need in your lives since we should use them , improve them . <\s>
<s> I partiall agree with the statement that the young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> It indeed seems that the youth are more energetic and many new things around us are created by them , however the old people also enjoy their life in their own way , which may be no less than the youth do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , we have to admit that the youth , due to their age and physical strength , are more likely to take part in some fierce and competitive acitivities , such as football , disco dancing , bungee etc , Therefore , their life are full of thrills and challenges more probably . <\s>
<s> For example , if you want to take part in the football game , you must be strong , firm , not afraid of your opponents no matter how strong they are . <\s>
<s> Then you must strive not to let your goal pass into the opponents ' team , you also need to discover or create the best opportunity for shooting . <\s>
<s> Therefore , this is a good experience of relaxing yourself and acquiring a sense of accomplishment . <\s>
<s> Besides the activities that are suitable for the young people , it is no doubt that the young people are more sensitive to newly-emerging things and terms , because their knowledge structure is not set , so they dare and are willing to taste things that are new to them . <\s>
<s> With the development of technology and society . <\s>
<s> You can find many new terms such as cool , surfing the internet , iPod , 3x etc . <\s>
<s> All of these are created and used by the youth for the first time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , these does n't mean the older people have nothing to do to enjoy their everyday life . <\s>
<s> On the contrary the elderly people , because of their experience , is more wise in making important decision about what should give up and what should stick on . <\s>
<s> For instance , many successful investment are accomplished by business who has rich experience . <\s>
<s> So impetus at a time wo n't make them make wrong decisons will cost billions of money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , the youth and the elderly have their own characteristics in enjoying their life . <\s>
<s> Maybe the previous like to try something new and exciting , the latter prefer a calm and rational way of enjoying life . <\s>
<s> It is often said that people will not dirve a car as many as these days in future because prople want to protect envoriments . <\s>
<s> However , I do not agree with the opinion . <\s>
<s> I believe that people will use more cars than now in twenty years . <\s>
<s> This is because , as population grows , demand of car also would be increase . <\s>
<s> In addition , new cars which uses different kind of resources are starting to advent . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , demand for car will be boomed because population is getting increase . <\s>
<s> These day , it is almost impossible to move without car . <\s>
<s> when we go to school , market and even parent 's house , we drive a car to get there . <\s>
<s> This demend of car depends on population . <\s>
<s> Following Yonsei university 's statisitcs , there are more car where many people live . <\s>
<s> For instance , Seoul , which is a capital of Korea , is the city that have lots cars and people . <\s>
<s> Most people live in Seoul drive a car and they plan to buy new one for children . <\s>
<s> This shows that as population increase , more car will be driven . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , there are many new cars that use enviroment friendly resources such as water and sunlight . <\s>
<s> Thoese cars will make people want to buy . <\s>
<s> These days , many companies can produce these kinds of car without technical problem . <\s>
<s> In a soon , people can easily see those cars on the streets . <\s>
<s> As a result , people do not need to worry about pollution . <\s>
<s> It will make people use more cars than before . <\s>
<s> Most people were afraid that they will destory nature by driving a car . <\s>
<s> However , new inventions will lead us feel free to drive . <\s>
<s> From my personal experience , I felt it is not agood idea to drive a car which makes lots of air pollutions . <\s>
<s> However , When I saw water generated car , I do not worry about that peoblems and want to buy it . <\s>
<s> It is clearly show that new cars will lead bigger car markets . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , I firmly believe that there will be more cars than there are today . <\s>
<s> Increasing population and new cars which operated by enviroment friendly resources such as sunlight and water will result this phenomenon , People should focus on how they improve the situation , not prevent . <\s>
<s> young people think that they can enjoy their life more than the older ones , but in my opinion I think older people can enjoy their life even more if they want to . <\s>
<s> Sometimes you see a 100 old man or a women that can talks like a 20 years old man . <\s>
<s> This is related to the feelings and to the minds . <\s>
<s> For example , if a 20 years old man always nagging about his life and always complaining about life and problems and never stops a moment to think and ask himself : is life really worth it ?? <\s>
<s> am I really sick or thats just in my mind ? <\s>
<s> he will always feel sick if thats what was in his mind . <\s>
<s> Accepting your life as it is is a treature and most people these days do n't have it ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> there is a question that how can the older men enjoy their lives ? <\s>
<s> to answer this question we should ask ourselfs first What are the pleasures in life ?? <\s>
<s> I mean it depends on each person . <\s>
<s> some people think of parties and calaberating all day long . <\s>
<s> Others find pleasures in their food . <\s>
<s> what can he eat on the next meal ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> traveling is a pleasure for some people . <\s>
<s> They travel all around the world to discover more places and meet new people . <\s>
<s> others just find their pleasures sitting home watching TV all day . <\s>
<s> so , back to our question : what can be the pleasure of an old man ? <\s>
<s> you ca n't say really it depends on his personality , but maybe in my opinion he just love to sit home with his family doing many stuff that we see it as silly stuff but its really maters for him , like drinking tea with his son and discussing some things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally , you can be young in your heart no matter what your age is . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> We watch TV , listen to the radio , or watch internet everyday and while we watch TV programs , listen to radio programs , or watch internet website , we often see or hear numerous different commercials that explains about numeours kinds of products that the company want to sell to us . <\s>
<s> Although some advertisements are really exaggertaed and give false information , I think most advertisements provide us with correct information . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advertisements we often see during the commercial break on TV is the car advertisements . <\s>
<s> When it comes to a car advertisemt , it shows us the outside and the inside look of the car and provides us with the engine information , safety information or warranty information . <\s>
<s> There is no way for the car company to exaggerate or lie about their cars . <\s>
<s> Because for example , if they lie about their car 's safety , they can easily get sued or prosecuted by the government . <\s>
<s> There are also electronic wheel chair commercials too . <\s>
<s> The commercials tell us that teh electronic chair is safe , useful for elderly people and also has warranty . <\s>
<s> Now , is there any way for the companies to exaggerate or give flase information about the wheel chair . <\s>
<s> Absolutely , no . <\s>
<s> Commericials of the comapnies that sell mechanical products are mostly not exagerrerated and therefore , consumers can rely on them . <\s>
<s> ALso about pills for headaches . <\s>
<s> Those pills just work fine and they are not exaggereated . <\s>
<s> If they do n't work , the comapny would not be able to sell their products in the first place because the government check their products before they sell . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , I do n't think that most comercials make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> I think both are important . <\s>
<s> To learn ideas an concepts help to us to ubicate in a context and time . <\s>
<s> Normally , they are very useful when there are not experience in one subject . <\s>
<s> Concepts help to start to know about any issue and then , normally people start to develop your own judge about things and understand the different alternatives that exist for a problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other hand , Facts are also imporatant because bring to us part of the knowledge and helps to bring more information . <\s>
<s> I think every fact must to be acompanied by concepts and ideas clearly understood . <\s>
<s> Facts help to us to have a general idea about some special issue and help us to ubicate in the context we want to develop . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also facts helps to understand about anything in a very brief manner , they are very useful when there is a short period of time for analyze information or know about something . <\s>
<s> i.e. If you are a customer and need to know about some company , it will be very helpful to have a spreadsheet of the company with the main facts . <\s>
<s> After that you will have to investigate more about that fact but it is very helpful for initiate that investigation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Concepts helps to support any idea that each person want to develop , also help to understand how the things works and evaluate diferent options . <\s>
<s> Concepts are essential part of our life . <\s>
<s> If we dont have concepts , we dont have knowledge , so we need to be guessing all the time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is important to mention that to know a concept is not enough , the most important issue is understand it , because once we know the concept and understand it we can apply our own ideas , other concepts , solutions , etc. and find a logical solution to almost all the things . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement although it is really hard to imagine that there should be fewer cars in use in twenty years . <\s>
<s> During the last century the use of cars has namely grown enourmous , but I think that there will be a change soon beacuse cars are getting more and more expensive and people are earning less money . <\s>
<s> Soon most people will not afford a car any longer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first problem is that in our century of unemployment you cannot spectaculate that people will get more wealthy during the next time . <\s>
<s> Maybe even more people will get unemployed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A result of this is the second problem , the fiscus needs money to ensure that all of those unemployed people are able to survive . <\s>
<s> The fiscus ' most likely opportunity to get money is to higher taxes and fees and because petrol is nothing you need to survive , the fiscus highers the petrol tax at first . <\s>
<s> Petrol , which you need to use your car , is getting more expensive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The third problem is that our petrol-ressources are fading . <\s>
<s> In a few years there will be no more petrol to get and the prices for the last rests will explode . <\s>
<s> The result is that petrol is getting more and more expensive , but in a very fast and rabiate way ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I know that there exist alternatives for driving with petrol , for example using bio-diesel , solar/energy or a hybrid motor . <\s>
<s> But these technologies have not still grown out and only few people can afford them . <\s>
<s> They can be further developed and they will be further developed , but this will need a lot of time ( more than twenty years ) . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that in twenty years many people will have got rid of their cars and will not look after petrol alternatives but after car alternatives ( public traffic ) like busses , trams or trains . <\s>
<s> Selfishness is probably inner in the human-kind . <\s>
<s> But as humans started to live in community , they learnt to share their commons , space and time with each other . <\s>
<s> With the appearence of the industrial revolution and theories and ideas like the capitalism , people tended to come back to a kind of primary form of selfishness . <\s>
<s> This is not a condamnation of the capitalism , it 's the way it had been used for a while , especially by young people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During a certain period of time , the early twenties for example , young people used to think , and people around them used to make them think , that because they were young , they got their lives to live in integrity in a selfish way and that the whole world belongs to them , they just have to live . <\s>
<s> This way of life appeared especially in rich countries . <\s>
<s> It does'nt mean that poor countries did n't know this way of life , they did , but later . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some decades later , young people started to feel that even if it 's ok for them , even if they have every thing they ask for , it was n't enough to get a balanced , healthy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people nowadays , and at the contrary of the last generation , know that , to make your life better , you need to share your time , your money and your love with the others , that they need to make people around them happy to be happy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So people who say that young people do not give enough to help their communities , are very far of the truth . <\s>
<s> In all the wars , earthquacks , tornadoes , ... <\s>
<s> and all the catastrophies that our planet lived and still live during the last century , nobody is giving away , sacrifying lives , money and time such as young people are doing . <\s>
<s> Of course they are always irresponsible young people around the world , but the universal tendance today is for sharing everything . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Now I am working for a Japanese company in Japan and usually the holiday I can take is really shorter than other contries . <\s>
<s> To travel efficiently , traveling in agroup with a guide is the best way . <\s>
<s> I do n't need to spend many time to find a resturant and to worry about the losing way . <\s>
<s> And the other good point is that traveling in a group , I can meet many people who I can share the atmospere of the places . <\s>
<s> I will explaiin more details as follows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason is that traveling in agroup with a tour guide help me to travel effeciently . <\s>
<s> As I mentioned before , I cannot take a long holiday as a usual Japanese company . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I do n't have enough time to stay the same place . <\s>
<s> To visit many places in the short term , I need a guide to help me to go around . <\s>
<s> In addition , I do n't so worry about emergency situations such as losing ways , traffic jams , and train delays because a tour guide usually know how to handle the situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason is that I can share the impression of the trip with group members and exchange our opinions . <\s>
<s> Even though traveling alone can make more free time , I would like to share the atmosphere of the places with others . <\s>
<s> For exsample . <\s>
<s> I will go to a resturant during the trip . <\s>
<s> If I eat alone , I cannot enjoy the meal . <\s>
<s> I will miss someone who can talk to me . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I can travel many places during my short holiday if a guide lead me . <\s>
<s> Moreover , I can share how I feel in the place with other people . <\s>
<s> Yes I agree with the statement given that `` Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already knoe how to do well '' . <\s>
<s> I think it was important and necessary that the succesful people might go on new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Here the reasons for my agreeness are stated . <\s>
<s> For example take the person who has in the book of Guiness records , let 's think he was able to done the feet that he can balance a twenty number of glasses by placing them on his mouth . <\s>
<s> By the next time he was trying to or attempt to balance the one which has more wait than the previous glasses and not to increase the previous number . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let take examples about our scientists who discovered or invented the things that are now very useful in our daily economy like fans , refrigerators , televisions , telephones , etc . <\s>
<s> Coming to the technology first they discover the telephone with the wiring communication . <\s>
<s> After that they did works on improving the communication without wire or wireless communication and not stoping there . <\s>
<s> Now a days we can made remote controls so that we can operate or control something else what we required . <\s>
<s> I think these may not happen if the talked people were not take risks and invent the new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To agree my statement I can take cricket heros who had breaked or won the many number of records . <\s>
<s> Recently in the 2007 world cup that was going on one of the match between South Africa versus Netherlands the south african batsmen named Gibbs made an unbeatenable record by hitting six sixers in a over and scored thirty six runs that no bats men evermade . <\s>
<s> Telling more about the cricket related to the statement given every team must put their maximum efforts to create the new records . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , I can agree the given statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . <\s>
<s> I think the statement can motivate the persons s who can do the same things everytime . <\s>
<s> Teaching is a major activity in ones life . <\s>
<s> People improve theirselves by learning from the schools , experiences and the like . <\s>
<s> The more they learn , the better they lead their lives . <\s>
<s> However , there are many disagreements about how to teach students . <\s>
<s> Besides how is taught is so important , what is taught is also vital . <\s>
<s> Learning can change the life and improves the communication of ones to the others and the environment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The importance of understanding the ideas and concepts is much more required according to learning the facts for students . <\s>
<s> Firstly , it can be considered that there is not only a true for any circumstances . <\s>
<s> There are facts and people decide which fact is their fact . <\s>
<s> It will be unlogical to expect people doing all the same things . <\s>
<s> Hence , the best way is to teach the ideas and concepts of the other peoples . <\s>
<s> This will help them to find out their own paths . <\s>
<s> Demonstrating people the cases which others are passed by and showing the behaviours makes much more sense . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , if ideas and concepts are taught instead of facts , the improvement in cultures begin . <\s>
<s> Learning the way of reactions to the different circumstances by different people make ones go one step further . <\s>
<s> According to a survey lead in an European university , people are selected from different cultures are put into two different classes A and B. The people in the A class are given a piece of paper writing that the boiling point of water is 100 celcius . <\s>
<s> Besides the other group is making an experiment showing that water boils at 100 celcius and the idea beneath it . <\s>
<s> After a while , they are asked to examined and the results show that B class members are much more successfull according to the other group . <\s>
<s> This shows the importance of ideas than the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the light of these , it can be cited that ideas and concepts are worth to be learned to improve the community . <\s>
<s> Also they help to find people their ways . <\s>
<s> I believe people become richer because they work so hard , people work hard they can get more oppotunities , not only they try new things , they must do a lot research about how to lower the risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To set up a big company not a easy thing , a successful people in charge of all of the empolyee , all the boss had in his head are how to lower a risks , because if the boss can deal with the company , the empolyees might lose their job , the guy might not become a successful people . <\s>
<s> people only focuse on what the successful people did , and forget to concentrate on what the people managing or marketing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A successful engineer do a research for long time , but they must study about engineering since he was in junior high school , but people only remember he created a new technique , even though people want to try new things , they still need a lot knowledge and experience . <\s>
<s> We can not only think about how much money the poeple earned , why they got a lot complements , we should start think about how much time they spend . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addtion , much people take risks to do their own business , they still can earned lots of money , become a famous person , but if they can not control the risks , they might fail in one day . <\s>
<s> Lucky are not still with the same person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In concludsion , successful people know how to do well because they spend a lot time , maybe they still get experience from failure , they learned many things before they successed . <\s>
<s> Do you always succeed to buy a something though it 's advertisement ? <\s>
<s> Some people think that advertisement always convey real aspects of their products because consumer can be know after buying the products . <\s>
<s> However , I agree with the idea that real products could be defferent from the advertisements in that advertisements have a limited time to attract consumer and we can misunderstanding about that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main reaon why I think that real products are more disappointable than that of advertisements is that companies want to make their advertisements more attractively because they do not have enough time to provide information about their products . <\s>
<s> For example , when a new car is intoduced in the market , the car company make the advertisement very attractively because they should allure a lot of customer as possible . <\s>
<s> However , they can not explain all advantages of the car . <\s>
<s> In that reason , most advertisements are made much better than real . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , when we see advertisements , somtimes we can misunderstanding about the products . <\s>
<s> Seeing a real product is very different from just watching television advertisement or seeing the paper advertisements because we might see the colors differently or understand the function differently . <\s>
<s> For example , when I bought a new computer , I disappointed about the real product because the color and size are different than I expected . <\s>
<s> I wanted black color and small size computer , but the real product was grey color and bigger size . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , most advertisements want to make people attract and we can misunderstand the advertise <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people because there are several reasons to explain this firstly older people health will not be well compared to youger people by this most often they cannot go for out of stations for picnics , excertions or tours but younger people visit all the places and enjoy the beauty of atmosphere . <\s>
<s> They even learn how to survive in different weather conditions in future if they have to face . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , older people cannot able to learn new things faster and they cannot able to update their knowledge as compared to the younger people . <\s>
<s> younger people has that stability that they can change themselves from changing world . <\s>
<s> They can even give the world a new product for changing world as concerned to older people their brain doesnot work properly after certain age and they cannot develop new products for the changing world as compared to younger people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another main thing about the older people is that they stick to their old taste that doesnt exist in the present life this is advantageous for the youger people that their tastes exist in the present life and they can enjoy more than older people such as movies , clubs , pubs . <\s>
<s> But in case of older people they cannot enjoy the tastes of present life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> younger people can participate in sports such as cricket , soccer , baseball as it is starting age for them but in case of older people it is not possible for them because their health conditions must not satisfy the requirements of the sports . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the present busy life older people are not able to survive the fastness of the current world as in case of younger people they are able to survive and their are becoming the creators of the present world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For all this reasons I agree younger people enjoy more than older people . <\s>
<s> Being a Young person i believe that in today 's professional world young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , as they prefer their profesional life has a dominant role in their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now days life is getting very professional as compared to earlier days . <\s>
<s> Earlier , people use to work till the evening and after that they go somewhere around with their friends , parents , family but now days the work pressure is so much that they dont have time to even take a proper sleep . <\s>
<s> According to the recent surveys working people especially aged between 23 to 40 could not sleep for even 8 hours a day which the doctors advice one should atleast sleep in a day . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Earlier people treated temples and churches as the places where they believed that god lives and they can be relaxed and make themselves calm but nowdays people treat those holy places as a picnic spot where they can go with their children and enjoy . <\s>
<s> Nobody wants to work like Mahatma gandhi . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are many NGO 's which are working for the welfare of the community but no one joins them rather no young person joins them , you can find most of the retired person who are working there as an officers because they dont pay you much . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today young people wants to achieve the higher goals as to earn more money . <\s>
<s> Higher they will go in their company higher the remuneration willl be . <\s>
<s> For eg.an employee of a company can work there for 18 hours in a day but if he is being asked to work for a NGO or any social community then he will definately say big NO to it as it will not be higly payable as he is getting in the company <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> After considering all the facts i believe that young people wants their life to be the most succesful professionally not for the welfare of the community in which they live in . <\s>
<s> It is a controversal issue that which is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Some people say that students learn facts because it 's easy to memorize about something . <\s>
<s> But in my opinion , students have to learn ideas and concepts about something because of two reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , learning ideas and concepts are a basic way to understand everything . <\s>
<s> If they just memorise facts about something , for example , maybe at that time they think they know everything . <\s>
<s> But after that if they met some problem that are simmiller with something that they just learned , they will not be able solve the proble because they just learned not basic ideas and concepts but the fact about something . <\s>
<s> which means they do n't know how to solve the problem and how to think to find the way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , if students learn ideas and concepts about something , it makes students can more creative than that they just learn facts . <\s>
<s> For instance , if students learn about a car and understant ideas or concepts about how to move the car , after then they can expect that how to move a truck or bus . <\s>
<s> Also , they will think about other transportation like a train or subway and think about their work . <\s>
<s> Maybe these thinking ways make students more creatively . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , because of reaons that I above mentioned , students have to understand ideas and concepts when they learn about something . <\s>
<s> It is a best way to understand and also it helps students think about everyting creatively . <\s>
<s> ofcurse i disagree with thise statement because when you are successful in your work you have to continue on it , because in this time taking risks are very bad , if you fail maby you will be poor so you can feed your family or your self , then it will be hard on you to find a new jop because there are too many people are searching also for a jop . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My other opinion is that when you are happy in your jop why do you have to take risks that you do n't no if you will succes or you fail , every body knows that if he will succes ofcourse he will be happy , but when you take a risk and fail i 'm sure that he will extreemly sad and maby some times he will become ile so bad , and some times few of these guys who was successful then he faild in his bisnans they die because they have lost too much , like what happend to a friend of mine , his father was a successful man in his jop then he chosed to work in a new thing , in the begining he succeed then after two months he last every thing that he had . <\s>
<s> and guess what he died and i 'm so sorry for him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thats why i don ; t think that it 's a good ideia to take risk in some thing that you do n't know , i know that i do n't have knoledg enogh to give these successful men an advise but please listen to me if you are succese in your jop stay one it to have a beter life to live with your family if you have one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> After that i hope that you all successful men will listen to me and then i 'm sure that you will thank me latetr . <\s>
<s> People always discuss that which one is more imporatnt betwee understanding ideas or concepts and learning fact . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , make students learn fact is more useful and helpful than just make them understand the concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , if students just understant the ideas and the concepts then when they face the problem in the real world they will not know how to solve it . <\s>
<s> The propuse of people learn knowledge is they want to studt how to use these information to solve the proble in the society , so master the skills to face and deal with the problem that they have is the most important rask . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , let the student learn facts throuhg the practice can make them more clever and give them much important information . <\s>
<s> Throuhg their experiences they can learn many thing that they can not study in the classroom . <\s>
<s> These useful information and experiences can teach them ues thier own way to solve the difficult problem and make them become more wise . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , if people can understant how to face the fact then they will have a better relationship with other people and the whole society . <\s>
<s> they will use a suitable way to consider their life , and do a better choice . <\s>
<s> The connection between single person and the whole society also will become bettter . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People live in a complex real world all the time , we will meet many different peolple and many difficult problem , but if we can understand the fact completely and know how to use the right way to solve them , then we can get a bettter life . <\s>
<s> Because of these rasons , learning how to face the facts become a so imporatnt thing in people 's lives , if we can learn and understand facts but not just know the concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> Since Humans exist , one point has always been discussed : advantages and disadvantages to be young or old . <\s>
<s> Once again , we are going to try to determine whether young people or old people enjoy the most life . <\s>
<s> Before starting , it is important to precise what means young and what means old . <\s>
<s> For example , I have been treated as amn old person by my sister during the christmas holidays and i am only 23 . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For this essay , we wil consider that someone is young until his first official work day . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people are more able to enjoy life than old people . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact , they can project to do whatever they want without thinking to the consequences of their acts . <\s>
<s> You can go out all night long and forget going at school in the morning . <\s>
<s> you will not be fired for this . <\s>
<s> However , if an employee is doing the same , it is going to be harder to provide good excuses . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Basically , when you are young you depend on your parents and you can be sure that they are going to help as much as they can . <\s>
<s> So you can try . <\s>
<s> Amn old person is going to consider the point totally differently . <\s>
<s> First of all , this person can be responsible of a family , of a team , of a company . <\s>
<s> It gives him the obligation to be ready 24 hours a day for them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In contrary to this , how can you enjoy your life if you have just your time to spend . <\s>
<s> In fact , the world is crual and gives the power to enjoy to people that have the less the time to use it . <\s>
<s> Enjoying life is very easy if you have enough money to do what you want to do . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , only old people who work for years can allow them to enjoy their like . <\s>
<s> Traveling around the world , going to the Stade de France for the world football cup final , buy the last Ipod ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As I said , it is very easy to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , it is not free and it seems that only old people are able to do this . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All our life , we want to be what we are not . <\s>
<s> When we are at school , we want the driving licence to go out during the week end . <\s>
<s> When we are student , we want to work in a good and reliable company in the way to have a family and buy a house . <\s>
<s> When we are employees , we fancy being in retire ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We just need to be us . <\s>
<s> There are several ways of travelling to many different kinds of destinations . <\s>
<s> People could travell in groups lead by tour guides , by themselves , with a partner . <\s>
<s> I believe that the best way to travell varyes completely on the destination of the trip . <\s>
<s> If a american does not know how to speak japanesse is taking a trip to japan , it would not be advisable for him to go by himself . <\s>
<s> In that situation I would much rather prefer to travell in a group with a tour guide who obviously speaks japanesse . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another case scenario would be an american person travelling to hawaii were its languaje is spoken . <\s>
<s> Of course it would not hurt to have a tour guide who knows the place to show this person around but if the purpose of the trip is heading to the beach to relax and enjoy , no tour guide should be necessary . <\s>
<s> I would travell with someone other than a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I do not fully desagree with the statement nor fully agree with it . <\s>
<s> I firmly believe that the best way to travell depends on the destination and the circumstances of the trip . <\s>
<s> I agree to the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> There are three reasons to support my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , especially where I live in Japan the population is getting smaller every year . <\s>
<s> Some people estimate that the population would be half in the future . <\s>
<s> Of course , when the population gets smaller , people who use cars will be decreased . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second of all , the focus on the environment is getting bigger every year . <\s>
<s> Without doubt , the fossil fuels that cars give to the air are very bad to the environment . <\s>
<s> So I think that the use of cars would be restricted internationally in twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , it is more dangerous to use cars than to use trains . <\s>
<s> The number of the traffic accident increases , so people might get to think that they should use trains to move because it is much less dangerous than to use cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For those reasons , I definitely agree to the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I strongly agree with the statement `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . '' <\s>
<s> Students are required to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> The main reason for this is the ideas are going to increase the way they think and the concepts help them to implement their taughts . <\s>
<s> The lecturers should teach students for getting ideas for new things from there childhood . <\s>
<s> They should give some question and tell them to implement their taughts . <\s>
<s> Such that their brain gets more ideas when they see or come to know about a perticular point . <\s>
<s> Suppose for an example let us take a topic in mathemetics , there are many ways to solve one perticular problem . <\s>
<s> Here comes picture of ideas the , student thinks in many different ways to solve a perticular problem any how , these can be implemented only by concepts but not facts . <\s>
<s> And puzzles con be solved by implementing different ideas . <\s>
<s> Suppose a puzzle has many ways then only idea can help him to find the right way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Facts are that which have already taken place . <\s>
<s> Facts can be learned by there own . <\s>
<s> One can gather facts from newspapers , magizines and many other places . <\s>
<s> Facts are implemented earlier , before facts ideas and concepts are developed , with these development of ideas and repeatly occuring of the same thing they were recorded as facts . <\s>
<s> Some facts may help the student but with out concepts these fact may not be understood clearly . <\s>
<s> Facts are those they are already implemented . <\s>
<s> These can be read and know about them and can implement only up to a certain level . <\s>
<s> But , when an idea is striked it can be implemented by their own knowledge using concepts . <\s>
<s> For example , scientists would read facts and keep in mind but they implement or invent new things by their own ideas and the concepts they had learned . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , we can conclude that facts are developed from the implementation of ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> The mindful body : a peculiar paradigm <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that specialize in one specific subjcet is better . <\s>
<s> Specialising you can give to your reserch a peculiar prospective and than increase your field of study . <\s>
<s> Let give us some example based on my experience as anthropologist . <\s>
<s> I think they could clearly illusterate what I mean . <\s>
<s> During my anthropological field work in Cameoon , West Africa , I argued that there were lots of intresting aspects of this african society ( for example kinship , economical or religious sistems etc . ) . <\s>
<s> However I Decided to foucus my reserch on witchcraft and sorcery . <\s>
<s> Observing life in a small village I saw that I colud note phenomena of witchcraf in all social fabric . <\s>
<s> The occult power was used a socilal and economical levellhood . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover when I wrote my BA 's thesis I used a specifical prospective and a peculiar method of analysis . <\s>
<s> I used the post-modern prospective on hidden cults of japanese chirstians and i demostrated how these hidden cults influenced the modern japanese chistians and others religious movements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I tried to anlize just one aspect of the African or Japanese society and I tried to explain how these particular aspects reflected on whole society in different levels . <\s>
<s> I think that have a broad knowledge of may academic subjects is not good or usefull . <\s>
<s> A man could not be omniscent - as god - so is uneuseful try to accumulate many many notions about different arguments and topics . <\s>
<s> Thus men , students , professors and so on need to recognize their limits and to work - as better as possible - on within their field of study . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This are the reasons why I think that specialize in one specific subject is the only way that men could adopt to costruct a brand new paradigm about knowledge . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , there are more and more advertisements showing on TV , magzines , and other media . <\s>
<s> As a result , people increasingly depend on advertisements to know certain products . <\s>
<s> I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisers often make appearence of goods more beautiful than they really are . <\s>
<s> for example , I often buy clothes through internet . <\s>
<s> I found the fact that clothes does not have same color and style as it was shown on internet . <\s>
<s> This often makes me angry . <\s>
<s> Another example , many houses are advertised through media . <\s>
<s> Some houses looks more acceptable than they really do , with lovely shape and beautiful color . <\s>
<s> However , when you go to see the true house , it is not the same appearence as it looks like on advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , for the purpose of attracting more buyers , advertisements make products seem much convenient than they really are . <\s>
<s> for example , sellers advertise for the cars . <\s>
<s> Most of advertisements show that owing a car is a symbol of high level living condition . <\s>
<s> There is often a scene on the TV that whole family go to beautiful nature park for camping happily and wealthily , Of course , a luxurious car always exists in the background . <\s>
<s> However , this advertisement does not consider the side effect of cars such as sending out smog and making noise . <\s>
<s> Also , family may spend much on gasoline and repair fees . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In sum , since most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , as buyers , we should pay attention to and try to adoid this problem . <\s>
<s> Also , i advocate for true advertisement which can give the reliable information on goods . <\s>
<s> If the youth new and if the youth is an old thought which has always been used to question the issue of this essaz . <\s>
<s> This is a controversery issue . <\s>
<s> Indeed how could life be characterized to enable us to affirm that young people more enjoy it than older do . <\s>
<s> Considering the interresse , expectations in life , culture and financial abilities , one would agree or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Indeed about young people , although they have the physical power and the strenght to try everything and to make new experiences , they can travel all over the world , are able to lern many things and plan for a tomorow , they still have a lot all misadventures coming and are rarelly realy fit to accept some realities and therefore go through deceptions bad sides of life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people have gone through or have had the opportunity of going through everything live had offered to them , have made their choices and now can look over their shoulders and smile or not . <\s>
<s> In any case , for them the action part of the life belongs to history and they can enjoy other features of the life they have . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Rich people from reach family have a defined way and they don t need to burder for what they have to achieve . <\s>
<s> Still their youth is uncertain because everything changes and they also lack of everlasting certainity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe One can only really enjoy when the work is done and although life can be exiting and pleasant some time , everybody always get up in the morning and start again to built up . <\s>
<s> Everydaz enjozment helps us to get over but the real enjoyement is that of the older who know how thez have have done . <\s>
<s> I agree with the following statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Why the successful peole are success ? <\s>
<s> Because they would love to try the things that never happen before . <\s>
<s> Then they succeed and these new stuff let more and more people interested in it . <\s>
<s> The ending will be lots of people want to work with you and it will be developed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It 's pretty hard to do a known thing . <\s>
<s> There has already been some people getting knowledge and doing well . <\s>
<s> In some way , it 's hard for you to do it better . <\s>
<s> Because the people , who has already known it , their next step will be to do it better . <\s>
<s> You just start it . <\s>
<s> That 's not impossible to do it better but it cost time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you use the time to do some thing new , it 's much better to another way . <\s>
<s> Finding some things new is liked a travelling . <\s>
<s> You can feel many new feeling and get more express that never happened before . <\s>
<s> Then , more and more people will be interested in your travelling and join you . <\s>
<s> It will be developing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But anyway , there 's still some problems . <\s>
<s> Because it 's a unknown stuff , no one has experinces before and you must be your alone when you were starting it . <\s>
<s> It 's so difficult that so many people failed . <\s>
<s> You will face a lot of challenges and fight with them just by yourself . <\s>
<s> Maybe some one will laugh at you or you will lose yourself in the finding way or you will enter to a dark land . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Yes , it is difficult . <\s>
<s> Also it 's the why you succeed . <\s>
<s> It means you are better that the loser in this way . <\s>
<s> You are the winner . <\s>
<s> You are succeed . <\s>
<s> You will get some honors and prize . <\s>
<s> But the greatest things you got that is the knowledge and express and how to deal with these challenges . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To do it . <\s>
<s> Do you have more pleasure when you were kid than when you are grown up ? <\s>
<s> It seems quite obvious . <\s>
<s> We will see that being young provides less responsability , more time and places to socialize and a better health to enjoy the life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The biggest difference between older and younger persons is that the young ones has less sorrows . <\s>
<s> Children and teenagers do n't have to care about money , their parents do . <\s>
<s> They also do n't need to worry about cleaning the house , buying food , it is also their parents jobs . <\s>
<s> The lack of responsability enables to focus on other things in life : having fun . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> School is not only a place to study , it is also the best place to make friends . <\s>
<s> Courses and breaks are special opportunities to discover new persons and socialize with them . <\s>
<s> During all the studies , a student will meet more people he will ever can in his grown up , office life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Old people has also other concerns . <\s>
<s> As we say in France : `` If young people knew if old people could ... '' <\s>
<s> . <\s>
<s> Health and physical condition is not the same for everybody . <\s>
<s> For older people is more difficult to practice sports , dance in night clubs old night long . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people will always regret their youth . <\s>
<s> I do n't think that young people really wants to share their parents ' life ... <\s>
<s> According to my point of view , sucessful people try new things and are likely to take more risk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal , he wants to have something new and more difficult to do . <\s>
<s> Human beings are hardly satisfied and I ca n't help thinking that when somebody has succed in something , he will always want more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Alpinists , for exemple , do n't usally stop climbing after they managed to reach their first summit . <\s>
<s> They always want to climb an other montain , harder and higher . <\s>
<s> Napoleon 's Bonaparte , the french emperor and conquerant did n't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finaly defeated . <\s>
<s> And I think because he was sucessful in a first time , he could n't get rid of his will of power . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An other reason would be the fact that sucessful people can start being bored by what they do , even if their activity matches success . <\s>
<s> So to avoid this phenomenon , they just start a new thing . <\s>
<s> We can find this kind of behaviour in sports . <\s>
<s> We can take the exemple of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi , who had won dozen of world championships . <\s>
<s> Well , he is now looking forward to become a forula one driver . <\s>
<s> Because he wants something new . <\s>
<s> Something that gives him the opportunity to achive a other great goal . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A last important factor is , according to me , the fact that when somebody managed to win something , or to earn something , he would probably want to get more of it . <\s>
<s> No matter if it is money , glory or power . <\s>
<s> The joy of winning might even be more important than the profit whitch came with this success . <\s>
<s> A good exemple would be a poker player or a gambler . <\s>
<s> After winning some money , they would probably bet more of it . <\s>
<s> And it is actualy dificult to get rid of this circle . <\s>
<s> The number of cars that we can see every day in the street is incredibly huge . <\s>
<s> Cars are very usefull to move quickly from a place to another and quite every family seems to be able to afford one or even two or three of this means of transportation . <\s>
<s> People do n't seem to be able to find another way to move so confortable like this ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course there are some aspects related to the use of cars that in my opinion may influence the future . <\s>
<s> One of this is the price of oil or fuel . <\s>
<s> This is a great proplem that nowadays all the world is facing . <\s>
<s> Prices seem to grow more and more every day and if the situation will not change , if all the countries wo n't find a solution , people will be able to afford cars no more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another aspect related to this is the fact that petrol will not be available forever . <\s>
<s> In fact this natural resorse will end , not in twenty years , but surelly in a future not so distant from our time . <\s>
<s> So men has to think to a possible solution , for example electrical cars or other means of transport to substitute cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are even negative aspects related to the use of cars . <\s>
<s> Fuel or oil , which cars need to work , are the first causes of air pollution . <\s>
<s> Our governamnets are tring to find a solution to this problem , introducing days during wich cars are not allowed to be used : but it may be possible that in the future only a small number of cars would be allowed to circulate in order to reduce pollution . <\s>
<s> Nowaday , during the school , we ask to the students to do a choice between differents courses because they ca n't study all the subjects during his high degrees . <\s>
<s> Some people are for this opinion nonetheless some people think that is better to have braod knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the one hand , some people think that is better to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Firstly , no body can know all on all . <\s>
<s> People are not computer , they can not konw all . <\s>
<s> Moreover , to obtain better for a job , you need to specialize your knowledge to be more performent and to become the best . <\s>
<s> For example , between two persons who wants the same job , the society takes the person who has learned much on the topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , someone think that is important to have braod knowledge of many academic subject . <\s>
<s> Whether you know lot of subject you can discuss with a lot of people on all . <\s>
<s> For example , you can speak sport with someone , finance with another or motor . <\s>
<s> You could have a lot of friends . <\s>
<s> Futhermore , You can anderstand what 's happened in the world by listen or watch the news on the media . <\s>
<s> That important to the people to know the news and to speak about it with someone . <\s>
<s> Although no body can know all on all , everybody want to learn the more possible , that due to the humains want to know how the world is . <\s>
<s> They need to know a lot of subject to understand how the other think and why they do that they do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I think that very important to have a large knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Because the people need to discuss between them to make relations , to work and just only to live his life . <\s>
<s> More subject he know and better will be his life . <\s>
<s> In the current society , not having his drivers license means a none access to differents things coming from places , foods and jobs . <\s>
<s> That shows the importance of cars in the society . <\s>
<s> Car consums fioul which emissions are the main cause of global warming . <\s>
<s> Therefore the tendancy is to limit the negative impact of our state of life on environment including car . <\s>
<s> The aim of this esay will be to discuss about the evolution of car number for the next 30 years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Manufacturing car involves many different industries like steel , aluminium , flat glass and plastic production . <\s>
<s> Those massive industries take an important part in the economy of a country . <\s>
<s> Then , the decrease of production of car will have an important impact om it until new orientation are made . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthemore , mamy cars works with fioul which leads the economy of many contries too . <\s>
<s> It must be say that car using alternative energy are emerging but as petrol will lead the market , producers will not have sufficient help and concideration . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition to that , east countries like India and China faced to an important economic development . <\s>
<s> The demand of car will be very hight for the next few years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefor I don , t think that the level of car will decrease . <\s>
<s> The solution is more to change the mind of drivers : they use car to often : money solution like driver tax entreing a city like in london sociological orientation better use of common transport bus train <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Change in the process of car consumption and so were one of the most part in economy of the country In some countries , statistics have showed that there are more car than people . <\s>
<s> Lay off against car 's manufactures like in california but no real impact Delocalisation in eastern country , growth of hina and india so more car will be constructed in this areas . <\s>
<s> So the real question is not to know if there will be fewer car in use in the futur but if those car will be more against the environment . <\s>
<s> Policy regarding the ennvironment are becoming more and more present in European countries and so the industry has to suit to thise laws . <\s>
<s> N <\s>
<s> One statement I will support for sure is the following `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' . <\s>
<s> In this essay I will try to demontrate my opinion using specifics reasons and differents examples . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The mean objective of adverstisement is the purchase of the product by the consumer . <\s>
<s> Almost everything is allowed to make the product appears better than it really is . <\s>
<s> This is one objective of advertising . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So obviously when you discover the product you might be a little bit desappointed . <\s>
<s> For example , almost everyone has been desappointed by one product that appears to have incredible properties on TV . <\s>
<s> I remember having been desappointed with a christmas gist because the toy I saw on the TV was not the same as the one I received but actually but it was the same but was not that fantastic as the TV said . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another striking example is advertisement for candy and chocolate bar , in the advertisement they say that it is good products made with natural ingredients , but what they do not say is that it is bad for health to eat such junk food . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Almost all advertisement do not state the bad side resulting in the consumtion of the product , or try to exagerrate the good properties of a product for instance a product might appears bigger in the advertisement or more shiny . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a results with the help of all these examples I support the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> The issue at this hand is you should better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> I belive this because all the subjects you have knoledge is not uued in future why because if you inter in to any interview taht they ask spasalization . <\s>
<s> This reason is used to define the above statement . <\s>
<s> This is importent because if you have broad knoledge of many academic subjects than to specialized on one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I donot believe this because is you have many academic subjects in your academic years . <\s>
<s> These all subjects you reed not used in real life first reason is if you attend any organigation interview thy spcify the subjects . <\s>
<s> Because you need not have a broed knoledge of academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that all the subjects you have broad knoldge is some academic subject used in future like if join any college that if you are a computer student the collge is give you two or three subject give for lecture at that time broad knowledge of many subject used for lecturere . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally l belive that broad knoledge on many subject used in future thn that the specialized in one subject . <\s>
<s> they are many reasons to that if i have broad knowledge in many academic subject than specialized subjet . <\s>
<s> Speacialized subjects are used for yor jobs . <\s>
<s> If you have any specialization searching for any job organization mention the specialized the subject for perticular jobs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I belive two thinga that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specialize in one specific subject is used in carrir . <\s>
<s> Although many people say that we will not use cars anymore in the future , yet cars are necessasy tools even in the future . <\s>
<s> Namely . <\s>
<s> cars will still prevail . <\s>
<s> For this purpose , I do n't agree that there will be fewer cars in twenty years . <\s>
<s> Here comes discussion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the first place , Cars are great inventions . <\s>
<s> There are a variety of them and they help us a lot ; for example , transportation - both humans and cargoes . <\s>
<s> Besides , they save time . <\s>
<s> We benefit from cars very much . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Undeniably , convenient as cars contribute , we can not ignore the negaitve impact they make ; say , the exhaust and energy crsis . <\s>
<s> However , scientists are now trying to figure out some alternative solutions such as biodiesel . <\s>
<s> Using biological sources , cars will not cause environmental problems . <\s>
<s> Since new tecnology has been develpoping in a breathtaking speed , I am optimistic about the futhure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , cars will exsit , maybe changing into another form , but they will always exsit . <\s>
<s> After all , we ca n't live in a world with cars . <\s>
<s> They are too important to be thrown away . <\s>
<s> There will be more and more cars in the following decades . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advantages can turn out to be malign while misfortune to be a blessing . <\s>
<s> In brief , however , we should not abandon cars , not only because they symboize the milestone of human history but also because they are practical , even in the future . <\s>
<s> I am 22 years old now , that means I should be included to the `` young people '' used in the statement . <\s>
<s> That makes me think how my life is going . <\s>
<s> I ask this question to myself . <\s>
<s> And my answer is to agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I think young people , including me , do not or can not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> I will show my points in the following . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The question asks using `` young people nowadays '' in the statement , therefore , I should compare the young people in the old time with of them in nowadays particulary in the stiation of their families . <\s>
<s> I study in the university 4 times a week and I work at the restrant in nearby 3 times a week constantly . <\s>
<s> Moreover , I study English for the graduate school everyday . <\s>
<s> That shows that I can not have enough time to helping my family because I am too busy to do it . <\s>
<s> But tipically in Japan , women did not go to University to help their family and to learn how to be as a housewives . <\s>
<s> The enviroment that both young poeple in old time and nowadays has changed . <\s>
<s> It became giving chances to women to do what they want , on the other hand women became much more busy and lost enough time to help own families . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think there should be enough time for young people to helping their communities , though it seems difficult for me . <\s>
<s> To make it possible , not only young people but also all of the members of the communities have to help each other . <\s>
<s> I completely agree with the statement which says that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well '' . <\s>
<s> Those people , who are well known , they often want to be more popular and to attract more and more attention . <\s>
<s> We can talk about politicians as an example . <\s>
<s> Like Bill Clinton , former president of the United states of America , or Nelson Mandela , ex-president of South-Africa , who are helping the poor contries in africa and asia , a lot of this category of people work in organizations which have the same purpose . <\s>
<s> Another example is the entertainment artists . <\s>
<s> Many singers after beeing very successful and popular as singers try to move to Hollywood where they have the opportunity to start acting . <\s>
<s> And they even take a lot of risks like investing in a lot of businesses all over the world . <\s>
<s> The benefit for them is that they are known and they use their name to attract people ; and even their investement does not succed as they want , they always able o try others things because they have the money they need . <\s>
<s> In the United states a lot of artists , singers and sport-players have their own company or team . <\s>
<s> Consequently , months after months , years after years , they become more and more successful and popular and try news things . <\s>
<s> Consequently , they seem like handling the world in the pame of their hands . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , people who are successful definitely try new things and risk ; they rarely just do what they already know how to do well and most of the time , tey do it to get more money than what they own . <\s>
<s> As a result , that create in my view the problem poverty because the riches are becoming more rich , exploiting the second part of the population which is the class of the poors . <\s>
<s> I really do not agree with that statement . <\s>
<s> I have made a lot of travels with groups and alone and I have strong reasons to prefer hanging by myself . <\s>
<s> First of all , whenever you go somewhere with a group you have to move by the schedules that a tour guide or an agency already made for you . <\s>
<s> You are not free to get up at the time you want or visit other places than the expected ones . <\s>
<s> So , by the end of the trip you will never know if you really knew a new place or visited touristics sights . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , people in groups do not usually show respect for each other . <\s>
<s> What is more , they are mainly formed by an agency than by particular interests . <\s>
<s> In this way , you are forced to hang around with people you might not choose to be specially a close friend . <\s>
<s> You have to wait , for example , to those who are always late and you lose time you have already paid on those waitings , besides your conversations never grow in deepness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think travelling alone is much better . <\s>
<s> First of all , specially if you are on your holidays , you do not have to share or discuss your desitions with anybody . <\s>
<s> It happens to me last year , when I was on a group journey , that we were always arguing about what places to visit or even what to eat . <\s>
<s> On holidays , your are so tired of the whole year that arguing with someone exhaustes more than relaxes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , I like visiting places that most of the tourist not , for example museums , old buildings and cultural centres . <\s>
<s> Why should I spend my time visiting places I am not interested in or discussing my preferences with persons I know will not share them ? <\s>
<s> As a journalism student , I think that it 's more important learn the facts than anything else , so i 'm totally disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I ca n't understand how can be possible that you can learn and appreciate more the ideas or the concepts than the fact itself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> You do n't think is better evaluate and re-evaluate the fact and then establish your own ideas ? <\s>
<s> In my opinion , learning concepts and ideas , is learning what other people learned about the fact . <\s>
<s> Using others as a referencial group is n't bad or wrong . <\s>
<s> But the point is that learning facts makes you responsable for whatever you learned . <\s>
<s> In other words you just did n't follow anothers opinions , anothers concepts or ideas . <\s>
<s> You create your owns , and if they 're wrong , then YOU evaluate your own concepts or ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Precisely , is more objective the fact itself . <\s>
<s> Think of this : if you learned first the idea or concept , in some way you already know something and just stay in that line , but if you go directly to the fact you can have your own knowledge ... <\s>
<s> Created by you . <\s>
<s> There will be quite fewer cars in use twenty years later surely . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , there are trends not having any cars , encouraging the use of public transportation , and the attempts to invent more effective transportation . <\s>
<s> It is due to many contemporary car problems : Serious traffic jamming , environment pollution and lacking of oil . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , one of the reasons I expect fewer cars in the future is that the traffic jam on our roads is incredibly severe now . <\s>
<s> In some countries like Korea , the land are very densely populated , there are excessive cars on the road , there happens the traffic jamming even on the highway road . <\s>
<s> Not only for Korea , it is the worldwide problem . <\s>
<s> Many country are suffering from traffic jam . <\s>
<s> government will surely make policies to try to reduce car populations and traffic jam . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And one other problem as serious as above is the environmental thing . <\s>
<s> Car causes pollution in many ways , most seriously , the engine gas of cars make the sky foggy and dirty . <\s>
<s> It causes contagious eye diseases , and respiratory problems . <\s>
<s> In adittion , it promotes the global warming which is making mankind very afraid of . <\s>
<s> The carbon dioxide in the engine gas make the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth . <\s>
<s> And then the water level uprises and covers available land of us . <\s>
<s> Maybe we lose our whole earth to live . <\s>
<s> If cars wo n't decrease , there will happen a crisis of the entire human race . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , the remnant oil and gas is decreasing now , and in about 40 years , there will be no oil to depend on . <\s>
<s> in present point of view , we ca n't live without oil and gas . <\s>
<s> They are used to make fabrics , circulating plants and factories , and more and more . <\s>
<s> If we use all of them driving car , the thing will happen a lot sooner . <\s>
<s> So till we have a great resource to replace oil and gas , we should try to save it and invent other kind of transportions which are not taking any oil . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the points of view above , there are too many problms with abundance of cars . <\s>
<s> So for people to live , in the global view , they will not have cars . <\s>
<s> Ultimately we will be able to see not jamming roads and clearer sky with fewer cars in the road . <\s>
<s> Every one on earth has his own ideas that could impress or depress the the environment around him . <\s>
<s> The presence of these ideas does not cancel the fact that facts are dominant in our world . <\s>
<s> There is a huge difference between the two concepts and most people get mixed up between the two . <\s>
<s> Ideas are a special state of a person 's own inspiration and thoughts like the idea of inventing a time machine while Facts are things that remain unchanged for the rest of life like the fact that Sun revolves around Earth . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although the facts are what taking the people 's concerns , ideas are more important than facts because from ideas we can reach out facts . <\s>
<s> One good example of an idea developing into a fact is space rocket . <\s>
<s> First scientists had an idea of creating a method of transportation that could link us to space . <\s>
<s> They had the picture of a space rocket and they started to apply that inspiration and thougt to the facilities they had ntill they fullfilled their satisfaction and got the idea of inventing a space rocket to reality tha it became a fact . <\s>
<s> Now it is a fact that we have a method of transportation to the outer space . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another good example is the idea of making peace treaties among different countries . <\s>
<s> Although not all countries are on good terms with each other , some worked really hard and succeeded in getting the idea of making peace treaties with others to reality that it became a fact . <\s>
<s> So that little idea developed into a fact that every one knows about . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion those who really think that facts are more valuable than ideas are mistaken because as presented above we can see that almost all facts we know on earth have developed from small ideas . <\s>
<s> Basically , for one to reach or develop an idea , he must first start with an idea ; He may or mmay not realise that idea but as a matter of fact he could not have reached this fact without having an idea at first . <\s>
<s> That is mainly how ech minimal fact has reached us today . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement because the most advertisment even do n't show the product alone and discuss only this . <\s>
<s> Advertisments are just made to attract people and to turn them into a possible customer . <\s>
<s> They are made powerfull , colourfull and sexy . <\s>
<s> They show the product but often they do n't even discuss the predictions of it . <\s>
<s> In the past i had such an experience . <\s>
<s> I was blinded by the advertisment and bought the shoes . <\s>
<s> But after around two weeks they were broken . <\s>
<s> These shoes were not so stable and even not such comfortable like it was said . <\s>
<s> I just used them for walking and running . <\s>
<s> But they already were walking shoes and well i did n't run through a nightmare . <\s>
<s> So these shoes were obivisius not that what they had to be . <\s>
<s> I was truely blinded by advertisment . <\s>
<s> But now i know how to handle it . <\s>
<s> You have to be carefull with everything you want to buy . <\s>
<s> You have to compare the prices and even you must have a look on the product . <\s>
<s> You do n't need a eye of an eagle . <\s>
<s> I just mean that you should look at the product before you buy it . <\s>
<s> You shall look if it is OK . <\s>
<s> Well i have to addmit that i like advertisment because without it , it would be really boring . <\s>
<s> But it is not fair if the product ca n't reflect what the advertisment is saying . <\s>
<s> I think if you are the producer of an adverisment and you know that this product will be shown much better than it is in this advertisment then this production is made for a judge . <\s>
<s> You ca n't sell something and know it is not that what you will present . <\s>
<s> This acting is similar to cheating and you have pay for it . <\s>
<s> Nowadays people are discussing that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> I think most people , including myself , do n't agree that claim . <\s>
<s> Because it is superficial knowledge , does't help you for your job , you do take poor grades in the tests which is related to your major . <\s>
<s> Also I can count several disadvantages about the broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although you learn a lot of knowledge . <\s>
<s> they are all superficial . <\s>
<s> For example , you are engineer and you took art class when you were in university . <\s>
<s> One day perhaps you will meet a painter and start to talk about artm . <\s>
<s> What will you say about art that attracts the painter . <\s>
<s> Nothing , only you count the names of the artists . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also this knowledge doe n't help you when you apply for a job or during your job . <\s>
<s> If you focus on your major more , you will be more succesful in your job . <\s>
<s> Statics show that people specializing in one specific subject are more happy because they are more successful in their jobs . <\s>
<s> Also successful work life means that a good profit for you , because successful men earn a lot of money from their job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you focus on your major 's lessons , you will be successful not only in your work life , but also in student life . <\s>
<s> That means you are killing two birds with one stone . <\s>
<s> You will be more successful in your lessons because you can make relationships among the knowledges . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Taking everyting into consideration , I can clearly state that specializing in one specific subject is better . <\s>
<s> Special person make specializing in their subjects . <\s>
<s> Thats my motto <\s>
<s> Must people try new things and take riks in order to get success ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion the answer to this question in a world that is changing all days is `` yes '' , for the next reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , this is a learning world . <\s>
<s> I mean , a lot of knownlege and information is produced everyday , so the people who want to sucess they have to be avialable learn new things every day . <\s>
<s> Some reachers are found that the people must chance thier major aor carrer unleast one time in thier life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , in business are a lot of stories where the people that do n't take a risk and chance , lost a lot of money . <\s>
<s> Besides , the people who innovate has success . <\s>
<s> Examples of that are the transistor in the electronics business and the digital watch , that brings to Japan to the first world after the second world war . <\s>
<s> Other contries with more avantage than Japon did not want to take the risk . <\s>
<s> Japan did it and now it is the one of the most important economic in the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , It is easy to find a lot of personal stories of succes around new tecnologies and Internet . <\s>
<s> Yahoo , Google and You Tube based theirs success in a strange idea , work with out direct pay . <\s>
<s> So they offer a lot of service like mail , search information and host web page and videos without a recive any pay for that . <\s>
<s> They people who create the web portal take the risks and everybady know the story they made a los of millons of dollars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other hand , for each one of the people that take risk and become a successful people a lot of people fail . <\s>
<s> So take a risk it is n't a warranty to success . <\s>
<s> But what I can say is that every successful people had take a risk and try new things . <\s>
<s> During the 19th century , Adam smith the first classical economist made a plea for specialisation in work . <\s>
<s> People will know their job with inficiency and then can improve it . <\s>
<s> But , on the other hand Marx answered specialisation make people stupid . <\s>
<s> To do the same thing every time , do not permit to develope the mind . <\s>
<s> So a large knowledge was resevered to an elite which can thing the society whearas the others are controled by a lake of knowledge , then cannot realise their position in the society and how they are exploited . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In some extend , the problem is in this debate . <\s>
<s> In fact the answer depend of the context . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In our social life , it 's better to be specialised , because firms searched people with particular skills wich can use . <\s>
<s> So specialisation is used to promote people in the society thanks to labour . <\s>
<s> Moreover specialisation permit to have access to a knowledge very specific with its vocabulary and theirs owm issues . <\s>
<s> Biology for instance requiere high skills to understand it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the contrary , the knowledge of a lot of subject permit to be aware about our environement . <\s>
<s> It is important to understand our society which is built by a lot of diference knowledge . <\s>
<s> It is permit more specific vocabulary , and think on different aspect of our modern live . <\s>
<s> For instance we cannot imagine a politician which are ignorant of the main issues of his country . <\s>
<s> And there are a lot of things as economic system , lobbies , church , poverty or military aspect etc ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So in a democratic country as the western countries are a large is better . <\s>
<s> Its per ; it to people to understand and participated to the politic live and to improve their point of view thanks to knowledge . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , people who are specialised as scientis or doctor , have a wide knowledge too , in their specialisation of course , but again in others academic subject as mathematic for a physisian . <\s>
<s> To conclued , the more knowledge we have the more efficiency we are . <\s>
<s> During the cultural revolution in china , teachers were partiucly targeted because of their large knowledge <\s>
<s> I do agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> The reasons I support my view are following . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the successful people got success because they like to take challenge . <\s>
<s> To try new things is a challenge to everybody , because people who did not know those things before would not know how to do or what to do about it , but successful people can get pratice in the process of trying the new things . <\s>
<s> They can pratice there ability from geting the new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , successful people will never stop their step , they are always going forward , that means they will not just do what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> To try new things is the step that going forward . <\s>
<s> They can beyond their selves by this way , they can improve theie sevles to solve the problems following in the future . <\s>
<s> A successful people shall have this quality , or he can not be a successful people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , the generation is changing always , new things are occuring always , someone must go to try and get the new things , or the generation can not change , human can not improve ourslves . <\s>
<s> Why we call those people successful people ? <\s>
<s> Because they do something common people can not do and contribute to human society . <\s>
<s> So these people are always walking in the front of the generation , they start the new generation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I do think successful people try new things and take risks risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because this , our world is becoming better and better , . <\s>
<s> It is often said that young people would not spend enough time to helping and supporting their communities in our society . <\s>
<s> I disagree with that opinion . <\s>
<s> At first , I do not think that interest in policy has decreased over the years . <\s>
<s> The most important reason for that is that our system is democratic which means that people have the ability to vote and can influence policy which is not possible in a dictatorship , for example . <\s>
<s> Another important factor is that every citizen has this right from a certain age on . <\s>
<s> In the past , that often depended on the income and women did not have suffrage at all . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today , nearly every political party has a youth organization , as well . <\s>
<s> That would not be neccessary , if young people were not interested in policy . <\s>
<s> Furthermore there are a lot of poltical independent organizations which concern about the interests of the communities . <\s>
<s> In the past there were neither political youth organizations , nor independent poltical youth organzitaions In spite of the decreasing number of people to vote , I think it would be exaggerated to say that young people do not put enough effort or time in helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Some people think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , and some people do n't think so . <\s>
<s> In my opinoin , I agree it . <\s>
<s> First , ideas and concepts can build a good basis . <\s>
<s> Second , ideas and concepts can direct them to a correct way . <\s>
<s> For the reasons , I agree it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , understanding ideas and concepts can build a good basis . <\s>
<s> If you want to do anything well , you should have a good basis , for example , building a prefect building . <\s>
<s> In fact , when a building has a good condition , it must have a prefect basis . <\s>
<s> Besieds , after you understand ideas and concepts , you will build a nice basis . <\s>
<s> Plus , when you have a nice basis , you will be able to solve any problems you need . <\s>
<s> That 's why I think ideas and concepts can build a good basis . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , understanding ideas and concepts can direct them a correct way . <\s>
<s> Most prblems are resulted from a incorrect way . <\s>
<s> When you want to start a thing , the key point is that if you start from a right way . <\s>
<s> However , most people often ignore this point . <\s>
<s> It always makes them regret . <\s>
<s> As a result , a good begining must have a correct way . <\s>
<s> In fact , a correct way depends on how much ideas and concepts you understand . <\s>
<s> That 's why I think understanding ideas and concepts can direct them a correct way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I believe that you will always make a good job when you understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> I also believe a prefect job is from a good basis and a correct way . <\s>
<s> As a result , I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , in Europe and North America , almost each family owns at least one car . <\s>
<s> However , a few current issues raise the question of the number of cars there will be in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , there will be more car in use in twenty years than today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , it is obvious that the world 's population keeps increasing , which means that more people are going to need a car within the next two sdecade . <\s>
<s> Moreover , in important demographic regions such as China or India , more and more inhabitants buy a car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What 's more , one reason for which there could be fewer cars in use in twenty years would be the lack of oil . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless , according to scientists this should not happen before the year 2050 . <\s>
<s> Besides , in order to fight against the air pollution issue mainly due to the car 's traffic , scientists try to find out solutions , and work on other energy ressources such as solar energy , or even hydrogen energy . <\s>
<s> Then , if they eventually manage to create a new type of car which would not pollute the air , driving a car would not be a problem anymore for the atmosphere . <\s>
<s> Hence , the number of cars would be likely to increase . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that people tend to communicate more and more , and the road network is getting wider and wider . <\s>
<s> Then , people really enjoy travelling with their own car in order to be able to meet whoever you want wherever you want . <\s>
<s> Indeed , having a car provides me with a lot of autonomy . <\s>
<s> For instance , if I intend to go from one side of the country to another its is much more easier to drive my own car than to take the plane or the train , if the place I want to go is far from the airport or the train station . <\s>
<s> I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> In fact if a person knows concepts that are on the basis of every facts or situations , he can solve all these problems that are connected with those ideas , on the other hand , if he knows only the fact without havig the concepts and the ideas on the basis , he can solve only that problem and situations which are similar to that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All this is very important in many aspects or situation in our lives because everyday we have in front of us some different problems that we can solve only if we know the concepts and the ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Especially we find these problems in our works , in our offices , in our classrooms , in our homeworks , so in the our environmental work . <\s>
<s> For example one person can solve a problem easier and faster than other people because he has the concepts and the ideas on the basis of that work while other people know only the facts and , if a situation introduce a new solution or a new details , they do n't arrive to solve the problem , they do n't understand the new situation and so they ca n't arrive to the solution and to the implementation of the situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A person who knows concepts and ideas can solve all the problems that a situation or a detail can introduce and he can develop new solution and new implementation about the problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally I think that a person who knows only facts he knows only a little part of his work because he can solve only a schematical problemsv while a person that has many ideas and concepts he knows more things of his work and so he can solve all situation of a problem with new details and aspects and he can also find new and better solutions . <\s>
<s> I-m agree with the statement and I really hope so . <\s>
<s> I think that in twenty years a lot of thinghs must change and the use of cars is obsolutely one of these . <\s>
<s> Considering first the main problem > the price and the disponibility of petrol . <\s>
<s> In twenty years maybe some giaciments will be empty and the new one more and more unusefull becouse of the revalities between the east and the west of the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> SO if the price of petrol is too hight we can-t use the car , is too expensive for a family have two or three cars ... <\s>
<s> so become only one . <\s>
<s> Another important reason to get fewer the number of cars is the pollution ! <\s>
<s> if the number of cars continue to encrase we will be summersed by smog , smokes and poisons ! <\s>
<s> isn-t possible to live in a world more sick than this . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think also that inthe 2026 all towns will have new kind of busses and trains more conforteble , cheaper and faster than the actual one . <\s>
<s> So to go to the work , to go out for a pizza or to do anithing else you will take the underground not like now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Infect a lot of towns don-t have underground an the most of people don-t fell safeful taking it ! <\s>
<s> For example i-ve been in japan , to Kyoto and i can surely say you that there wasn-t traffic !! <\s>
<s> all by bicycle or by train ! <\s>
<s> So you can go aroud and not hear the noise of the cars and without sniff their smells ! <\s>
<s> I rally hope that in all the world people can enjoi their country , can live in town without problem and expecially that all economical and en problems close to petrol will desappear ! <\s>
<s> I give you 20 years of time <\s>
<s> My neighbour family had a car for all the family . <\s>
<s> when I was visiting them last time I saw three cars in thier garage ! <\s>
<s> I really surprised and I think after twenty years they will 8 cars . <\s>
<s> I belive that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I think that because of two main reasons : economic and population . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , I think that we will have more cars for economic reason because the world is becoming a idustrial world and all of people have a higher salary than before so they will spend more money in buying cars . <\s>
<s> As many rich stars do if they have mony , simpley they buy new cars . <\s>
<s> It is kind of luxsuries . <\s>
<s> Many people belive that if u have money , you have to buy a car . <\s>
<s> Because of the money that people will have and becoming bussniss people they must have a modern and more cars than the people had . <\s>
<s> Also , the cars factories will try to satistfy the consumers and they will produce more cars than any time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , because of increasing in population , many people will need cars to do thier daily jobs and thier works . <\s>
<s> As a result of this increasing , people try to satistfy themselves and thier family so they will buy more and more cars . <\s>
<s> I noticed that my uncle family have five cars because their family is growing and if we imagine what will happen after twenty years , we can clearly relase that there will be more cars in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If many people are trying to have a higher level for salary and the population number will growing I think we will have more cars than the number of people and the name for the next age will be `` car-person age '' . <\s>
<s> Knowledge is something that the more you have the better it is . <\s>
<s> It cant neither be robbed nor taken away . <\s>
<s> It is something that is going to stay with you forever . <\s>
<s> Though Knowledge of all the subjects is required but I disagree with the statement and believe that specialization in one subject is more neccesary . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Though i do not disagree that broad knowledge of many subjects is required but according to me broad knowledge knowledge of many academic subjects is required till say a bachelors degree when you are young and need information in all subjects . <\s>
<s> I agree that that if u have knowledge in all subjects then you will over all be a more educated person and have a better impact on people that you meet when u talk about a various number of things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But according to me specialization is much more important when you reach a masters degree because todays world is more of specialization and only those type of people are valued that are specialized in their field . <\s>
<s> See todyay if you are specialized in your field then you have a better chance of making to the top in this field and you cant earn a lot of fame and recognition in that field and you can also become a dr in that fields but incase of trying to know a lot of subjects would you might not be able to as good in either of the subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example we can see the Indian president APJ Abdul Kalam who is said to be the father of Indian rocket science but if he would try to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects like say History or Geography or any other subject then he wouldnt probably be as good as what he was in rocket science and therefore he would not have been as famous as what he was then . <\s>
<s> So thats is why in my opinion specialization in one subject is more important then trying to be good in all subjects . <\s>
<s> In today 's world , having a broad knowledge can defenitly help people in the society . <\s>
<s> They can apply for divers jobs , or they can even have two jobs , contrary to someone who is specialized in only one subject . <\s>
<s> But being specialized in only one subject means that the person knows his job perfectly , so he can have more chances to be hired for a specific kind of job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I think that having a broad knowledge is better than specializing in only one subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We were spoken with my american civilisation teacher about that . <\s>
<s> Is it better to do his master and to continue his doctorate on the same topic or we may change to show our skills ? <\s>
<s> That day I simply told him that knowledge is one of the most important things in live , we use it at school , but we can use it to give help to some people , for example , in high school , or in middle class . <\s>
<s> We can also be a teacher . <\s>
<s> We can teach French and English for example . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , not only to help people but for also for us . <\s>
<s> We can proove to ourself that we can learn different subjects , we can understand them , and finally be good at them . <\s>
<s> It can be seen as a way to be proud of ourself and having the feeling to be part of the society , as far as we are concerned by many points . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , having a broad knowledge means studying and also learning a lot , so we can be tired because of it , and not share time with his friends , his family , going to the cinema . <\s>
<s> It looks like having no fun , and to considering it that way , life can be boring . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I have tried to explain the reasons why having a broad knowledge can be useful ( help , proud ) but we must consider that this point of view can be limited . <\s>
<s> In television , papers and magazines a lot of people discuss , how our streets will look in twenty years . <\s>
<s> A lot of these discussion focus on the amount of cars . <\s>
<s> Reasons for this discussion are the changes energy supply and the pollution problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main reason , why there might be less cars , is that the petroleum resources are decreasing . <\s>
<s> Some experts say they only last about ten years . <\s>
<s> Another reason might be the increasing pollution . <\s>
<s> Politicans might introduce stronger laws or raise the tax on fuel to reduce the pollution . <\s>
<s> This could result in a decreasing amount of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A seldom focused reason migth be : Several people are going to share one car . <\s>
<s> This development can already be seen in Germany . <\s>
<s> In the last years the amount of car shareing stations has raised . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A raisuig usage of public transportation might also decrease the amount of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other side , there are a lot of reasons why the amount of cars will not decrease . <\s>
<s> The amount of cars has been raising through the last century and this trend may continue . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are also a lot of new engine techniks . <\s>
<s> These techniks allow cars be driven with solar power or hydrogen . <\s>
<s> These resources are not expected the be lass availible . <\s>
<s> Even an combination of an fuel engine and these techniks is possible . <\s>
<s> So the amount of cars will be constant , because the prices for these new technologies will fall . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think , the amount of cars will not fall . <\s>
<s> There will be differences in the type of cars . <\s>
<s> I think the cars will need less energy and produce less pollution the current cars . <\s>
<s> But since the car always has been a status symbol , a lot of people will want a car . <\s>
<s> The public transportation will not have an big rule in the future , because most goverments do n't have enough money to support this . <\s>
<s> The statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' is mostly received by travellars today . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement too and I will prove may opinion for several aspects in the following . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , as the rapid development of economy and society , efficient is much more important than before . <\s>
<s> So people must plan a detailed schedual for traveling . <\s>
<s> This will be waste much time for the people who have plenty of works and less chances of holidays . <\s>
<s> In this condition , traveling of led by a tour guide could save time and energy for people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , the tour guide will make a perfect plan for the travellars . <\s>
<s> The guide with abundant experiences of traveling and full of knowledge about the tour place , he or she could supply a good service for tourists . <\s>
<s> Therefore , tourists need not to consider anything about the detailed project of travelling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , there are many uncontrollable conditions and environments in the traveling place . <\s>
<s> Tourists who are lack of the experience are easy to be defected . <\s>
<s> For example , many people who travels did not in a group have the experiences that they may waste plenty of time in seeking for the traveling place and buses to the places , or they will be suggested to buy many expensive and useless things in the travel places . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , group traveling could make people feel warm and safe . <\s>
<s> People who travel as a single may feel lonely . <\s>
<s> The travels in the group could share with the excellent experiences about the traveling and when face to some problems , they could discuss them together and reach to a solution about the problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide may be a good choice for traveling and take a unique experience to the travellars . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Now , to make the statement clearly , I define the age of each people . <\s>
<s> I set the age of young people around 20 , and the age of older people around 60 . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I can not decide which people enjoy more because both of them has different kind of things to enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> So , I would like to compare some points . <\s>
<s> The ordinary differences between young people and older people are the phisical ability , the quantity of money , the variety of the experience and so on . <\s>
<s> Now , I compare these things between young people and older people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , as to the phisical ability , young people has more ability than older people . <\s>
<s> So , we can say that young people enjoy more than older people such as sports or dancing all night or other thing which needs energy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> second , as to money , most older people have more money than they were young . <\s>
<s> So , older people can enjoy more than young people when doing something costs a lot . <\s>
<s> For example , my parents enjoys their life with using more money than it used to be . <\s>
<s> They go to the restrant often and eat delicious meat , and they go to concert or see the show . <\s>
<s> These things are costs too much for the young people to enjoy often . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , the quality of experience is greatly differd between young people and older people . <\s>
<s> Because Young people have not know various things in the society yet , they can experience new things everyday . <\s>
<s> So they enjoy knowing new things , new people , new ways of thinking . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , older people can live with their various experiences for their long life . <\s>
<s> In the 60 years , they experienced various kinds of things which the young people have not expereinced yet . <\s>
<s> So , they know more enjoyable things than young people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Considering these points , I can not say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Both people enjoys their own life with their own steps . <\s>
<s> Some people may feel that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and Some may believe that successful people do not try new things and take risks , they just stick to things they can do well . <\s>
<s> However , i strongly believe that successful people are innovative and have the risk taking ability . <\s>
<s> I feel that successful people do take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Business is another name of risk . <\s>
<s> Profitability depends on the amount of risk taken . <\s>
<s> The more the risk , the better the profit . <\s>
<s> However , the risks should be calculated and should be evaluated carefully . <\s>
<s> Successful people do not take blind risks . <\s>
<s> Little bit of risk is everywhere . <\s>
<s> When we buy shares of a company we are subject to some risks . <\s>
<s> Even the movie actors may take risks in order to satisfy their audiences . <\s>
<s> A very good example is Doctor Amitabh Bachan . <\s>
<s> He is a superstar in Bollywood . <\s>
<s> He took a risk by changing his image of an angry young man to that of a comedian by performing some comic roles . <\s>
<s> He did this to prove himself as a versatile actor . <\s>
<s> Today he is praised for his successful attempts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Innovation is important to expand the business . <\s>
<s> In the world of competition , it is necessary to be innovative , it is necessary to try something and create something new . <\s>
<s> Technological growth , cut throat competition , changing preferences and tastes of the customers make it necessary for any organization to be innovative . <\s>
<s> Successful business man Mr.Dheerubhai Ambani was innovative . <\s>
<s> His story of rags to riches is very popular among people . <\s>
<s> His innovative ideas contributed to his success . <\s>
<s> He was the person who first introduced the concept of public shares in India . <\s>
<s> His decision made him a millionaire later . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , i would like to say that successful people do take risks and are innovative . <\s>
<s> However , their moves are planned . <\s>
<s> They take calculated risks . <\s>
<s> So in order to be successful one needs to be innovative and should have the risk taking attitude . <\s>
<s> Every person came on this world by thinking that he or she will enjoy entire life more than any person in this world world had enjoyed . <\s>
<s> It is well said that `` Change is law of nature '' . every person changes when he get older . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my view younger people enjoy their life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> It is a natural process that when a person get older his everything become older like his way of thinking , how he manges his further life and many more things . <\s>
<s> older people ca n't do everything what the youth can do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To hold my opinion i would conclude some points . <\s>
<s> First , old persons had enjoyed their entire life but after many years of his life he had not left any power in his bones or in veins to do any physically enjoyment while a young person have his bones like iron and veins like steel so he can do any physical enjoyment like going to party having dance etc. secondly , old persons had already done all the works which the youth is doing and so their all feelings of enjoyement had lost from whole of their hearts . <\s>
<s> while youth have fresh and warm blood so they have each and every emotions in their mind . <\s>
<s> thirdly , old perstons get more religious when they reach sixtys or more so they have no more plans in their minds to enjoy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> however , some people have beleif that older persons can enjoy the life more than the younger people but they should take in mind thaht there are many challanging situations in front of enjoyment of of older people like physical and mental conditions . <\s>
<s> we know that we cant acheive more than what is written in our luck we cant also obtain less than what we have to acheive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> finally , i conclude that it travels generation to generation and its the time for youth to enjopy their life . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with students should understand the ideas and concepts rather learning about facts , because getting idea or concept on a particular task leads them to analyse about the concept and think about its advantagees and disadvantages and how it works and finally how it can be manipulated . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> learning about the fact is important but its not that important as understanding an idea because learning a fact is something perceptual that is we can come to conclusion what we learnt out of the fact after the incident took place recently ar in the past but in case of getting an idea or concept we can ourselves analyse the end result . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Once in our university we had a chemistry class on various types of chemical substances their usage and their harmful effects . <\s>
<s> many of the students were not concentrating on the class . <\s>
<s> and few were listening but not tryiong to get the exact matter what the professor was discussing . <\s>
<s> and they were minding their own ways and the professor announced we are going to have a practical lab assignment next monday and the class dispersed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When the class met on next monday we all were in the chemistry lab for our lab assignment . <\s>
<s> many students were a bit worried that they did not pay attention in the class last friday but if they are not going to complete the assignement they will be loosing the grades . <\s>
<s> and most of the students were worried but out of fear students started practicals out of their previous knowledge and after some time there was an unfortunate incident which happened in the lab there was a huge explosion in the lab and the group of students who were performing the experiment and few besides them got injured slightly . <\s>
<s> but finally they recovered after a week that was good part though . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So no one can ever say we can learn out of the the fact after such a unfortunate happening . <\s>
<s> Thus i believe its better to get to know about the idea and concept for a student not only in few matters but if he gets to know the concept that will remain in his brain forever . <\s>
<s> not only regarding subject but also in other worldly matters understaning concept plays a vital role . <\s>
<s> Advertising is nowadays everywhere , and tries to make us buy every sorts of products with always new ways . <\s>
<s> Lot of people think that they are manipulated by advertising companies and that in advertisement the most important thing is to make the product seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can firstly think that as they use ways of persuasion that we understand we can always have our opinion . <\s>
<s> It 's a problem with chidren and advertising , but adults may be able to have their own opinions . <\s>
<s> Even if the advertiser tell us that is the best product of the world , we must be able to think about it and try to have our own opinion . <\s>
<s> Advertisers are not obliging us , they give us the choice but try to convince us . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In a very different way , we can think that their advertising is not just arguments . <\s>
<s> They often use what we like , our dreams and problems to make us think that we have a real need of this product . <\s>
<s> For exemple they often use our problem to sell us products , they give to a fat woman a solution that she can refuse , as she does n't like herself , so as to become thin like models in advertisement . <\s>
<s> In front of children , if an advertisement say that his super heros eat this sort of ice-cream , he will tell to his mother that eating this sort of ice-cream can make him be happy . <\s>
<s> We have to think about what it can be and if we really need this but it may be difficult in some situations where advertisement represents all we want to have or be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion advertisement is a very complex marketing strategy , but it cannot make the product seem much better than it really is . <\s>
<s> It just makes the product be as we want it to be . <\s>
<s> Products are created according to our needs but we have to choose and be critics about advertising . <\s>
<s> I think that parents have to understand that children do n't understand advertisement like an adult , and adult have to always think about what he really need , what he really can buy and what is really new in the product . <\s>
<s> If they do n't lie in advertising it is possible to buy just what we really want . <\s>
<s> Risk to Succeed <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Success is a path , not a situation ; so it needs skills for adjusting to the new circumstances , and more importantly creating own opportunities by taking risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I also agree that successful people are different than the conservative ones ; because thay have a different view on trying and also the skills to accomplish their targets . <\s>
<s> Of course risk taking does not mean to make stupid investments , but plan and coordinate everything . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In every risk you take there is a chance of failure , but if you get afraid of failing you will also wo n't get successful . <\s>
<s> In Chinese alphabet there are two icons for the risk concept . <\s>
<s> One of them is opportunity and the other one is loss . <\s>
<s> If you do n't take any risk you will never find the make benefits from an opportunity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> John D. Rockefeller who was one of the richest people of the world , once said : `` Do not be afraid to give up the good to go for great '' . <\s>
<s> He is considerated as a successor because of his attitude in risk taking . <\s>
<s> He cleverly saw the American 's need in changing in transportation from railroad to the motorway and used his chance in creating the world 's greatest oil company . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People who are doing only they know , will mostly do one thing on their lives . <\s>
<s> Maybe that will give them a more stable life with very low risk but they will never have to become very rich . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am a risk-lower myself ; and I try to look behind the scenes . <\s>
<s> Because I know there is always an opportunity behind . <\s>
<s> Because success is kind of a comparison <\s>
<s> In our technologicall world , advertisement is the key for the success and development of an old or new product . <\s>
<s> You cannot escape the constant presence of advertisement if you live in an average totaly or developped country . <\s>
<s> You read about it in news , magazines . <\s>
<s> You hear about it on the radio , on TV , or at the movies . <\s>
<s> Companies pay fortunes to advertise for their product in such a competitive way that they may override the truth about describing it or their use . <\s>
<s> I recently saw on TV a program about the president of a famous soda company whose policy was to keep changing the advertisement of that same product very often to keep the public interested . <\s>
<s> Part of what is true for each and every add , seem poor when you think about the real benefits of a soda . <\s>
<s> Caffeine beeing the main incredient , it can keep you energized but does not have the same positive effect on each one . <\s>
<s> My son is one example , if he drinks one of those sodas , he gets really hyperactive , in a negative way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Companies in an other hand are practiccally obligated to give information on the product that is not always right , because it becomes competitive with another product . <\s>
<s> When you think about all the different products offered for your hair , shampoos and such , for which I am very interrested , it becomes impossible to see which one you really want to buy , because they all promise to make your hair beautifull . <\s>
<s> Where is the truth , once you 've tried , you know ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When I want to buy a product that was advertised , I look at the composition of it , the features , the cost . <\s>
<s> I think people should be carefull not to spend a fortune on purchasing a product that could be wrongly be advertised for . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , i would agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than other people do because they do n't have to do anything but diostract themselves , I assume very young people around four or five years old when school is still a pleasure and a kind of distraction . <\s>
<s> While growing up their life will become more and more complicated . <\s>
<s> Homework going along with school will take most of their time until they 'll be graduate of an university . <\s>
<s> At this point most of any human as achieve twenty-five percents of his live and it has been painful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then they 'll start to work . <\s>
<s> For some of them it will be fine and other will consider work as the worst experience they ever lived . <\s>
<s> during that time they will be able to do everything they want whenever they want only if is not during the time they are supposed to work . <\s>
<s> They will enjoy life but they will always remember their childhood as the good old times . <\s>
<s> Then they 'll have children and they 'll have to work to provide them everything they need or want until they 'll leave the family house around eighteen years later . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some years after the childs will be gone , it will be time for them to get retired . <\s>
<s> And at this point they will enjoy life again even more than when they were young because they will be totally free . <\s>
<s> Itm is the time when people learn to take their time and enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Most of them will use the money they saved to travel around the world and see all they ever dreamt about . <\s>
<s> And then after they had had all the fun they wanted . <\s>
<s> It will be time for them to accept the fact that they cannot fight against getting older and they 'll die sooner or later . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I will finish with the point that on a ninety years long life , an human would have really enjoyed life around 25 years . <\s>
<s> Yes I agree with the point made in the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Since I came to the United Sttes , I 've been surprised how impact the US commercials . <\s>
<s> sometimes they make me laugh and shocked . <\s>
<s> Also , I 've doubted the exaggerated information . <\s>
<s> In my view , there are a lot of advertisements that does have a lot of propaganda for the following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , there are business competition in order to survive companies . <\s>
<s> Because of a balance between demand and supply , companies have to make the catchy and striking advertisements for public . <\s>
<s> The milk that I used to drink is the good example here . <\s>
<s> I refered the milk because of containing the healthy organic gredients . <\s>
<s> However , inspectors of the government just recently found out that there had been no organic materials in the milk . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of kinds of milk , healthy one or cheaper one , local , or soy milk . <\s>
<s> Most people decide what to buy by checking a package because they can not distinguishs the best one for them . <\s>
<s> As a result , the packages are the all about the materials themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , people have changed new tendency all the time . <\s>
<s> Therefore , companies need to fix in order to adjust the changed the fashion . <\s>
<s> For example , these days , people start to care about healthy food . <\s>
<s> Companies pull the customers or comsumers in the companies ' businesses . <\s>
<s> However , some companies can not change , so they put a fake information , such as 100 percent of nature . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As you can see , there are some reasones that business convey extra information to the buyer . <\s>
<s> The goverment needs to check companies in order to protect safe and reliable advertisemants for the consumers . <\s>
<s> Success Sleeps In Reality <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People who are in the search of new things and like to take risks rather than doing in well-known form may be considered successful when it is heard . <\s>
<s> However , I totally disagree with this idea of desire towards new things and risks for several reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason that supports my idea is that time is the most valuable concept in human life , and it should n't be wasted . <\s>
<s> It means that someone should run after empty dreams or the ideas that increases the slope of life , for human life is short . <\s>
<s> For example , when the history is examined , one can easly see that there were lots of mad scientists who dreamed lots of mad things including `` navigation in time '' , but if one looks at the results , there is nothing to applaude . <\s>
<s> Descartes , mathemetician and philosopher , can be considered a nice example for life , for the he was so successful although he did n't dream or take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason , that one should n't try new things and take risks , is the comprehension of the primitive knowledge ; that is to say , people may try to learn the theories or methods that have been already accepted by the authorities . <\s>
<s> Before creating or commenting , the knowledge should be enlarged as much as possible . <\s>
<s> By the way , instead of trying new things or taking risks , one can profit from its own knowledges or try to be satisfied in his borders . <\s>
<s> For example , if an engineer learns the current progressions in his major and improves himself , he does n't need to try new things or take risks to be succesful , because he is aldready succesful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , as the reasons are shown , I think that the idea of resting in peace of its borders , and following my life as it flows is better idea <\s>
<s> I do not agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> The reasons are three which are written below . <\s>
<s> First reason of disagreement is not to be able to choose places where I visit . <\s>
<s> Places where we want to visit might be different by each person . <\s>
<s> However , we have to dicide one place if we are led by a tour guide and travel as a group . <\s>
<s> In addition , a tour guide explain about someting I am not interested in at all . <\s>
<s> I want to travel wherever I want and I want know that I really interested in . <\s>
<s> I can ask to people who are familiar with the places instead of a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second reason is responsibility . <\s>
<s> In a group we have reasponsibility as a group member . <\s>
<s> We can not do something selfish and have to follow a tour guide . <\s>
<s> However I can go aroud freely if I travel by my self . <\s>
<s> The responsibility is only for me . <\s>
<s> When I went to Washington D.C. , I wanted to visit some ghetto places . <\s>
<s> We should go out in a group . <\s>
<s> However I can not take responsibility for my friends if my friends and I go some ghetto places and bad things happen . <\s>
<s> Therefore I went around by myself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third reason is about time . <\s>
<s> When we travel in a group led by tour guide , our travel will be scheduled like `` 6:00 p.m. visit musium '' or '' 9:00 p.m. eat dinner . '' <\s>
<s> However , how much time we want spend will change by each person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Because of those three reasons which are choosing places , responsibility and time . <\s>
<s> The idea of statemant is not confortable for me and I do not agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I agreed with the position that '' Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I have several reasons : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 1. The 20 Century inventors try new things and take risks <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 2. In my 15 years of Univerties studies , I found in several books of scientists , Universities magazines , that the people who wants to needs to be successful takes risk , risk in research , risk in budgets , contract , burse investment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 3. You never can to do big money with the regular risks . <\s>
<s> Never we can ear about people who are rich whith the regular risk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 4. Old things and no risk is a bad formula to be successful <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 5. USA is a Country championship in continuosly development new things and take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 6. The United Style of life in 500 year adopt the formula '' new thing and take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I have several examples <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 1. The Industrial revolution start in between end of 1800 and 1900 <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 2. The inventors invent in the 20 Century more things than ever in the history . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 3. In the last times the more important example in the Internet <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With the Internet the history of the world change : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Because each people in the world can acces the libraries and know about the diferent cultures . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The people can learn othe idioms , the people can buy that the can from all around the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And my favorites examples in the Internet bussiness are : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I. Googles , now the cost of this company are Billions of US $ <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> II . <\s>
<s> Yahoo , before Googles was the most successfull company in Internet . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> III . <\s>
<s> Pay Pals , the partners bought this company in one Billion Dollars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> IV . <\s>
<s> YouToube , this company was founded 18 months ago , and now was sell it in 1.300 Billion Dollars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This companys was developed successful peoply trying new things and taking risks ... <\s>
<s> With the above made statement , i fully agree for the following reasons : The best example would probably be the tobaco advertisements shown on TV , the cinema or as large posters at bus stations . <\s>
<s> Nobody could say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free , but a certain brand tryes to provoke this picture by showing landscapes , cowboys and horses . <\s>
<s> Another example is the food industry - what they say to be healthy often turnes out to be tho opposite , if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back . <\s>
<s> But often people do n't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they do n't have the knowledge interpretate the meaning of what they read . <\s>
<s> Of course - not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might become to our health . <\s>
<s> And that is one of the points I really think to be unfair from the froducting firms . <\s>
<s> To sell bigger quantities of their product , they willingly make believe people wrong things . <\s>
<s> Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body . <\s>
<s> They just want to do , have , eat or drink everything they are told is good , brandnew , cool . <\s>
<s> And so do their friends . <\s>
<s> Concluding my essay I would like to outline that of course this is not the case for every product or even ` most ' as is written in the statement . <\s>
<s> It would be unfair to declare advertisements to be generally false , dishonest or dangerous . <\s>
<s> There definetly are advertisements which state the truth about their product ! <\s>
<s> Many adversitements even show a houmorous content and can be really amusing . <\s>
<s> - for these reasons we can see shows at TV containing the ` funniest TV spots of the world ' - what an enrichement to our TV programs ! <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know is very precise and exact on its part . <\s>
<s> because a successful person is very ambitious and intrepid . <\s>
<s> he is full of spirit and ready to face any type of struggle or danger in any face of his life . <\s>
<s> they have a innate quality to invent new things and generate new ideas . <\s>
<s> it does not that successful people dont face failure in their life . <\s>
<s> but the fact is that they are not like other common people who lose their strength and determination in any part of difficulties . <\s>
<s> but rather they are people who spend their life only to face challenges and dangers . <\s>
<s> they follow on the principle `` failure is the stepping stone to success '' .doing only the things which you are confined to or which you know how to do well is very common and usual which can be done by anybody . <\s>
<s> the point lies in doing something different from others . <\s>
<s> there are certain examples showing how successful peoples are different from the common individuals . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , Issac Newton is the one who had invented the bulbs and due to his contribution we are now in this time are available with energy source else no source was available to us for lightening . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , there are many freedom fighters responsible for the freedom of india like Mahatama Gandhi , Rani Laxmi Bai , Subhash Chandra Bose and etc . , . <\s>
<s> without their help and contribution it was very difficult to achieve the freedom . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , scientists invent new things and provide us with innovative ideas so as to make us aware of the facts which are not known to us . <\s>
<s> ofcourse they face many failure in this course but they continue to work hard so to achieve their goal . <\s>
<s> if they will not work like this then we will be unaware of many facts which and will be left . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , a successful person does not care of the negative impact on its finding or work but continue to sustain in fields of various irresistable crushing force to fullfil the demands they want to acquire and to reach the acme of any enigma . <\s>
<s> Cars were a wealthy sign twenty years ago . <\s>
<s> Only , those who roll in money and live in good conditions of living could buy a car . <\s>
<s> In today 's society , in western countries , the majority of the population have a car . <\s>
<s> We can wonder if the increase of the purchasing power have increased the number of cars for the last year and if this increase of cars is a reality or just an illusion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To my mind , it is true that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> The fisrt reason of this incresing of car is the increase of the purchasing power . <\s>
<s> Twenty years ago , in western countrie , there were clearily two socila classes ; the haves and the have not . <\s>
<s> So , the upper class outnumbered the wealthier . <\s>
<s> Cars were considered as a luxious good . <\s>
<s> Nervertheless , for few years , the middle class has represented the majority of the western population . <\s>
<s> At the same time , cars have been developing and their price reduced . <\s>
<s> As a consequence , with the emergence of the middle class and the decrease of few cars ' prices , several persons could buy a car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason is the development of the mobility . <\s>
<s> In fact , in today 's society , a lot of people have to take a car to go working every day . <\s>
<s> Commuters are more numerous and they need a car to work . <\s>
<s> Furthemore , many firms need that their employees work in many cities and not on the head of office . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What is more , we can see every day that there are more cars today . <\s>
<s> In fact , every evenings and every mornig , we can see on the roads many traffic jams at rush hours . <\s>
<s> We can wonder if the increase of these traffic jams , that we can check every year , will not dilusionned many persons to take cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , we can notice that in spite of the development of trains and planes , the increase of cars is growing up . <\s>
<s> ` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' . <\s>
<s> I completely agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> This is because nowadays advertisement has become a very important issue for selling companies products , therefore it has become a great business . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today the important of advertising products has become essencial for their success over the population . <\s>
<s> This is why the importance of advertising and how products are shown to the population have increase in the past years . <\s>
<s> This is mainly because of the media influencing the people . <\s>
<s> More people watch television or listen to radio and therefore the companies with new products are encouraged to show these advertisements within these medias . <\s>
<s> They know about the people reaction to them and that they let themselves be influenced by these , having a positive response from the population . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , through this media the companies have the opportunity to show their new products as they newest and more advanced technological creation , which most of the time is completely false . <\s>
<s> The techniques they use to describe the benefits of these products are various . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example there are many advertisements that take a good picture of the product and display it on a big pannel or on a magazine and when people look for the product they realize it is not what they expected to be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also this kind of ' false ' advertising is used mainly on the products which are asked by internet of by telephone . <\s>
<s> These are the typical products that will dissappoint you . <\s>
<s> Another example are those long television commercials in which a product is shown and all its advantages are described and many reasons why it has to be purchase are given . <\s>
<s> In this way they start convincing and delighting you all the advantages described . <\s>
<s> More over , in this kind of commercial in order to make even more efficient they show other people 's testimonial about the product . <\s>
<s> In this way they convince you about the effectiveness of the product and therefore encouraging to buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , when the time comes to recieve the purchase product seen by television or by internet the expectations are really high but after using it few times you realize it was not as effective as shown in the advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> This is one of the reasons for many products successes , making companies economy to increase . <\s>
<s> There is a common opinion that the number of automobile users will reduce in the future twenty years , because of a great deal of problems that using cars brought about . <\s>
<s> But people may be regardless of the benefits that we human beings drerived from automobile . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Why do we still need automobile twenty years later ? <\s>
<s> The most important characteristic about automobile is coveniece . <\s>
<s> Rember there was a time when you drove your kids to schools ? <\s>
<s> A time when you drove to the countryside to have a picnic with your friends ? <\s>
<s> A time when you drove hurridly for a meeting ? <\s>
<s> How can you forget about those pleasent time u spent with your car and how will u be willing to throwing away , even after 20 years time ? <\s>
<s> We all need cars to bring us convenice and pleasure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One point that shold be admitted that , cars bring with them a series of problems , like air pollution , traffic jams , traffic accidents . <\s>
<s> In most of the big cities , the large number of car using cause serious air pollution , as a result , many people complain about this situation or even suggest that we should stop make use of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To solve the problem , it can not be dealt with simply by preventing us form using automobiles . <\s>
<s> A more effetive way is to improve the automobile condition . <\s>
<s> Governments should invest a larger amout of money to make progress on automobile producing , in order to reduce or stop harmful gas emmitting from cars . <\s>
<s> This is not the only responsobility for governments or scientist , is for all the human beings on earth . <\s>
<s> In this way , the process of using cars can be continued . <\s>
<s> We can both get benefits for convenience and fresh air breathing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , we will be better off with cares in 20 years . <\s>
<s> Looking at the values of modern western societies community service does not really seem to range in the top ten of aims a succssful human being has to reach . <\s>
<s> To be regarded as a proper member with a respectable social status for example one needs to have a career , regular income and all the incentieves that come with it , like houses , cars and journeys . <\s>
<s> Helping in your community just seems to be not an the agenda . <\s>
<s> Therefore I think that it is quite true that young people do not spend as much time for organizing events for the town 's elderly people or getting involved into cummunity meetings as 50 years ago but at the same I time I believe that it is not entirely their fault . <\s>
<s> Of course it is a personal decision to get involved into social activities or not , but on the other hand human beings are not as altruistic as they like to be . <\s>
<s> So if society wants young people to spend more time helping in their communities than I think society should start to appriciate and reward the work people are doing there . <\s>
<s> Nowadays social committment in general is regared as burden more than a duty . <\s>
<s> But without it communities simply are not able to work . <\s>
<s> I guess , modern men first have to realise this important fact in order to get community services back into `` top ten '' again . <\s>
<s> If this kind of commitment is rewarded again - not financially but socially , which means with a higher reputation - , I am pretty sure that young people will start to get involved again . <\s>
<s> An statements like the one above are part of <\s>
<s> In my opinion yes young people enjoy more life than a older people because young people are more enerzised , fun loving , enthusiatis , out going and more over a passion to do something new and great which attract others . <\s>
<s> lets take my example when i have gone for my holidays with my family me n my sister both has done riverrafting and diving whereas my parents were there but they had not done anything like this they were actually roamimg around in the beach and enjoying the wheather . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> similarly at night i would love to go night clubs but if i give change to my parents they would choose to go for a long drive . <\s>
<s> the only reason is i enjoy dancing and having fun at disc with friend and they enjoy conversation with there age group people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> another good example would be u can find a clubs in a ares where colleges and hostels and even place where more young people are there , whereas you find a nice beautiful park when you visit any society of retired persons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my organisation people who are working in field force as a sales executive or document pick up are mostly young boys or girls because they are more energetic whereas if you see in administration and back office more olderly people are working where job profile does not include much stamina . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> according to me older people would to do those kind of job which reqire more mental stamina rather then physical . <\s>
<s> young people has more stamina then olde people . <\s>
<s> But yes there are always exception i have a uncle who is always into a mood of enjoyment or having fun all the time . <\s>
<s> you find these kind of people very less whos has lot of energy even at older age . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> so its again depend on the person to person how he takes his life to potential . <\s>
<s> Although i understand people who say it is better to specialize in one specific subject i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> There are three reasons why i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Firstly if you have broad knowledge you can talk to much more people or students about academic topics . <\s>
<s> For example i am studying three subjects . <\s>
<s> This is a reason why i can talk with many different people about many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> That is why i met and got to know students from different subjects . <\s>
<s> We often spend time together while we are talking abuot our or one of our subjects . <\s>
<s> I enyoy this time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly i think it is better for your future when you have broad knowledge of many subjects . <\s>
<s> It shows that you are interested in many things or subjects . <\s>
<s> For example when you want to get a job it showes better when you can say i am interested in different subjects and when you have different knowledge than having very deep knowledge in only one thing . <\s>
<s> Another thing is when you are working in a company and someone has problems with something you can help or give solutions about that topic . <\s>
<s> And that is why a lot of people habe a lot of success in their job or in their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly if you have children i think the children have more respect when you can say i am familiar with different subjects than with one deeply . <\s>
<s> The children can learn more from you when you have different knowledge . <\s>
<s> I think it is very important for children when the parents have more knowledge than one deep knowledge . <\s>
<s> To sum up for me there are only important aspects to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and i would do the same way again because it is more important to have different knowledges of many academic subjects than to one deep . <\s>
<s> For example in a job or to talk with different peole or for your children . <\s>
<s> I definitely agree with the statement exposed before , since my experience showed me that understanding ideas is more important that just learning facts . <\s>
<s> I think that building models of events and things is the only way to study what surround us . <\s>
<s> Since I am studying engineering I will bring two examples dealing with my field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you can elaborate a mathematic model of how an engine works , than you will be be able to produce it and maybe also to understand , if there would be a damage , why that kind of misfunctioning has occurred , which is the first step towards an improved engine . <\s>
<s> While if you only had seen somebody building an engine , you will also be able to build one following the same steps but you would not be able to understand neither how the engine works nor why a damage could occur in certain conditions , or what is due to . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also if you have understood a concept you could probably happen to apply it to many different events . <\s>
<s> For example if you know what gravity is and why it works , will be able to apply your knowledge to tons of experiences . <\s>
<s> You will then understand both the reason of apples falling down the three when mature and not going up in the sky , as probably Newton did when he first explained this phenomena , and the reason of the moon rotating around the Earth and not leaving his pattern because the equilibrium between the gravity strenght and an opposite strenght due to his speed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Anyway I think it is very important not to loose the contact with reality . <\s>
<s> I mean that elaborating abstract models which do not have now and will not have in the future any concrete application it is an unuseful thinking . <\s>
<s> This is the risk of giving more importance to ideas than facts : finding ourselves thinking to the best idea , forgetting none of them will be then applayble to what is our final purpose . <\s>
<s> `` it is better to habe broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialise in one specific subject '' i surely agree with this statement because when you have a bigger baggage of cultural and scientifical informations you can be a better person and live a better life in all of its aspects but none the less for certain people to specialise in one specific subject will be more useful to them than to specialise in many academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all when you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you have a good degree wich will help you in the course of your life per example you will have a bigger chance to get employed then another applier that have only specialised in one specific subject so it will help improve your revenue . <\s>
<s> And this variety of academic subjects couls also help you in your social life where you are informed to lots of informations that could be a subject of a conversation with another inbdivudual . <\s>
<s> And a person benefits the most by his broad information is the intellegence and the experiences that could help him in how he lives his life , the way he thinks about things , the way he reacts to certain things , his interests his taste . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All these advantages are useful to the person has decided to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and has the capacity of achieving this goal . <\s>
<s> But some persons dont have the same capacity so for this category of people it is better for them to specialise in one specific subject where they can be good at it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion i can repeat that i am and i aplly this statement in my personnal life because it opens more doors and enhanse your life with various informations , but if someone hasnt the ability to conduct this way of life it would be better for him to specialise in one subject so he could be good at it because in this case it is better to be good in one subject than be bad in all of the others subjects because we dont have the time or the ability to succed . <\s>
<s> The way for student to understand ideas is a really important thing if they want to succeed in life . <\s>
<s> Some tend to understand the ideas and concept , but in an another way , there are some who perfer to understand only the facts . <\s>
<s> Nowdays , it is true that most of them prefer to learn facts . <\s>
<s> But in general , what is the best way ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Personnaly , i do not think that learning only facts is the best solution . <\s>
<s> Indeed , this type does not help us in our everyday life . <\s>
<s> For example , in history , i do not think that learning only fact is enough to understand the mains points , they juste pick them out and forget them later , so the work is not using . <\s>
<s> However , this kind of understanding can work sometimes of course , but one day , you will not be able to deal with any subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now i am going to deal with what i think would be the best way to do in life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , comprehenssion is the base thing that everyone must learn and improve in his whose life . <\s>
<s> Indeed , if you are able to understand the ideas and concepts , you will be self confident and all steps of your life would be easier for you to overcome . <\s>
<s> For example , in school and espacilly in highschool , the best student are those who use their brain in this way , that 's we uselly say that they are clever . <\s>
<s> By the way , a friend of mine understand only ideas , i mean , he works only with his memory . <\s>
<s> Thus , he is not so well in school and i am better than fim because i focus on understanding the concerpt of things than learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , we havve seen that is important for student to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Althought many people regard this way as a wrong thing , they are probably wrong . <\s>
<s> Everybody who think like that should change . <\s>
<s> The technological development today has proved itself also in the fields of automobiles . <\s>
<s> So it ca n't be said that there will be fewer cars in use after twenty years than today . <\s>
<s> Though there are problems which are faced today due to pollution and resourses decline , our technology has solutions to each and every problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are many technological innovations in the field of automobiles , and year many new designs and varieties of cors are being invented for more comforts . <\s>
<s> The cars which are designed today are using less fuels snd they are pollution free , which will be going to improve further in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The cars which run on biogas are presented in the market , they are creating no pollution , the fuel used is cheap and is available easily in atmosphere too . <\s>
<s> Though they are in less use today because of their high cost they may be used in the future in large demand according to the manufacturers assumptions because the costs of production of these cars may decrease in future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover in the coming years the world will be more developed and will be very busy too . <\s>
<s> A fast travelling media is necessary for every one who work away from home or go to colleges etc . <\s>
<s> Even the ordinary man can afford the car because their costs will be reduced due to high production and can drive the car too . <\s>
<s> Just like the costs of two wheelers have decreased the costs of the cars is also expected to decrease further so that the ordinary man also can afford the car . <\s>
<s> because the large population of the world is of the middleclass people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also the use of more advanced cars which run on biogas , a pollutionfree fuel will become must to reduce the atmospheric pollutions , the the use of these cars will be more demand among the rich people for the sake of their prestige and pride because they are more expensive cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence in coming twenty fears tere will be more cars in use than today . <\s>
<s> Generally , traviling to many places and make a differant experiance in our live is very good idea for people who want to explorare many place . <\s>
<s> They did not tavel to it before and meeting differint kind of culture that would be very wonderful . <\s>
<s> For tavel alone or with goup , i think the best way for taveling now is with group for two reasons : one of this is to get a chance to know a lot of gorouse place in the coustry that you want to tavel and other is to save your money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> many countries have a lot of historicals places and beautiful scenery that you have to vist it . <\s>
<s> Thus , the travel with tour guide orginse your time to have a chance to see these place . <\s>
<s> In addintion , to save your time for how to go to this place without losing your direction or your time . <\s>
<s> Otherwise to get the apportiunty to meet differeant people from differnt counties in the group . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the money is very important to for you . <\s>
<s> if you want to go with your fimely or alone . <\s>
<s> Nowaday , there is a lot of offering to many countries with a sutible price for family or individual . <\s>
<s> Even though , you do not have a lot of money , you have a chance to travel to many places in low price . <\s>
<s> That give you relax and injoying with other people without care for many to much . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In deed , to get a good price and good peole to ravel with them is a best way for relax and fun . <\s>
<s> if one would not jump in to the water one could not learn how to swim . <\s>
<s> yes i agree with the statement that to be a successful person ane should be willing to take risks in life and try new things rather than just do what he has been doing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> many of our ancients has gone unorthodox way and had been maverick . <\s>
<s> this is the reason we hav seen the new ages arising with better lifes . <\s>
<s> ability of human to think and do new things make him different from animals and there makes him to achieve new milestones in life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> if a person would just follow a same routine or the same fashion what his ancestors has been doing there would be no progress . <\s>
<s> people would not be able to find solutions to the problems they are facing and therefore could not be able to make there life more comfortable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> scientists , architectures , doctors , engineers are few of those people who contribute a lot to the development of the society and if these people just keep doing waht they know and been taught , i fear we could not see any further advancement in our present age and the progress could only happen if the worldmakers try new things in life and take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> taking risks in life and therefore try new things probably help human to learn and gain experience . <\s>
<s> might be that he may hav to face the faliures and dissapointment in initial stages but sooner the success will kiss the feet . <\s>
<s> no one is born perfect it is the practise and the determination to try new things makes the person a better one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> if manny of the great freedom fighters had not taken the risk and had faught for the freedom of there country we would not hav seen manny of the great nations . <\s>
<s> also if the faomous astrologer has not stood against the religious beliefs and hav said that its the sun which is in center and not earth we would hav been unknown about the mystries of universal . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> if man had not taken the risk to step on the moon there would hav been no neil armstrong . <\s>
<s> The choise between giving more importance to the understending of the ideas or to pay more attention in the learning of facts regarding student 's preparation is a point hightly discussed inside schools and universities by teachers and directors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is true that to learn facts is the basement for whatever kind of knowledge in every field . <\s>
<s> Student need to study facts ; in this way they can face and compare the differences between the notions they learned . <\s>
<s> This is a starting point in the building of the cultural background of each person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Otherwise understanding ideas offers a real and a pratical way to cheack if students gets completely the concepts they are learning that is definitly important as well . <\s>
<s> To provide a deep understanding of concepts and ideas allows student to grow up inside , to judge the world , the past events and the current affairs in a very open minded way . <\s>
<s> It helps them to developp thei personality and their way of thinking . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My personal opinion on this topic is to do n't proivilege one system to an other . <\s>
<s> I definitly think that they are both essential in the ppreparation of a student and that they should be used in a very balanced way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The importance of learnig facts is something that ca n't be doubted from muy point of view but it is also true that in many case students that just lern notions without understanding the real concepts and ideas that came from these notions are not able to connect this concepts to the real world and to use them to grow up . <\s>
<s> They remains simple machines full of important notions that are not only able to live their life in a producive way but also to use thenotions they learned to improve their life . <\s>
<s> I believe that successful people try new things & take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well . <\s>
<s> If u keep doing same thing over & over again no one is going to impress what u did but if u do something new every one is going to surprise how u did this & they will become curious to know about it . <\s>
<s> Without taking risks its not possible to do something new , ex.if u want to gain more knowledge u have to learn new things to learn it but u are not sure that that knowledge is going to help u somewhere in ur life . <\s>
<s> but if do not take risk & do not start to learn new things u r never ever in ur life is going to find out that knowledge will be useful for you or not ? <\s>
<s> It will be mystery for ur whole life u live . <\s>
<s> So i think that if want to be succed in your life start learning new thing instead of following same old things that u already know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The 1 reason i believe this becoz , Especially at this time world is booming , each & every second some one is investing something new that no one knows . <\s>
<s> so to keep track with present world we have to try something new instead of sticking with same old thing u already know . <\s>
<s> ex.each & every day cell phones company , computers company , actually all eloctronics companies introduce their totally different & brand new models . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The another reason i believe this becoz if u try something new u will make more money than with the same old thing . <\s>
<s> ex.if u make new desing for cloth that no one invented yet , u r definateley going to make money.2nd ex.if u build the house , which is totally different than the usual houses arond u going to make more money & u going to be more popular too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> in other world its not limited for only electronic or builer buisness but it true for any thing u can imagine in ur mind , in today 's world every one want latest facilities , designs , equipments , etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , in conclusion successful people try new things & take risks instead of sticking with same old things that some one already invented . <\s>
<s> but remember 1 thing , success is not possible without taking risks . <\s>
<s> I live in a city and I can see everyday so many cars moving in the streets and a lot of traffic . <\s>
<s> People are stressed and they are fed up of queues and skip in their timetables . <\s>
<s> This incredible amount of cars moving does n't have positive effects of course ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that pollution is the first consequence of the increasing number of cars . <\s>
<s> That-s why I would prefear a cars reduction in the future . <\s>
<s> At the same time I recognize the importance in having your own vehicle , you can go wherever you want , with no barriers and constrictions in timetables , like for busses or trains . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Anyway I think that there are several ways to avoid pollution without reducing the number of vehicles . <\s>
<s> First of all , I think that in the future there will be dicovered the existence of particular kinds of fuels to prevent pollution , there are already some of them in use . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second solution I would suggest , is the increment in electric vehicles business . <\s>
<s> Today there are some of them in use , but they are not so common maybe because they are too expensive . <\s>
<s> Any way I think that if everybody start to buy this kind of vehicle , its price will be reduced . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , pollution does't seem to be the only consequence of increasing in cars , but there is also a lot of traffic , as i mensioned before talking about my city . <\s>
<s> Traffic makes a city unliveable ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all traffic has an effect on a person well being I think , it 's stressful , and then I think that it always makes you change your programs and your timetable , that 's why I think that in a future people will change vehicle anyway . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For me , a solution to cars increasing could be the emprovement of public vehicles > undergrounds , trains , busses everyday more efficient and faster . <\s>
<s> In such a way the pollution will be reduced but at the same time there will be less traffic in return of your own well being . <\s>
<s> Regarding the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' I think it depends on the situation and the country or place where you are going . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Traveling deals with a lot of things like : language , culture , nature , weather , kind of inhabitants , available time , etc. and for every case it coulbe a different oppinion about the statement . <\s>
<s> For instance if I 'm in China probably I will prefer to be guided by a skilled tour guide , otherwise anybody can get lost , but if I 'm going to an European Country in that case I will prefer to go on my own . <\s>
<s> Time is also important if you have little time for traveling then an experienced guide will be very heplfull to know as much as possible in short time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Regarding groups , if you are with a group where you do n't know anybody it will be very different experience if you know all of the people in the group very well , like in a football team or schoolmates . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if your intention is to know new people in the place you are visiting , then traveling alone it could be an advantage . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other important factor to consider is the reason or the final intention of the travel . <\s>
<s> For instance , if you are traveling to rest and be away of noise , to have a time for yourself or , on the contrary , you are willing to know new places , people and cities . <\s>
<s> In both cases , the group or the guide is a big difference . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As explained , it is necessary to take a lot of things into account before to agree or disagree with such general statement , but if I have the oppotunity to travel , I will prefer to go to Europe in a group and without tour guide , in this case I do n't agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I would agree with the following statement that `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' . <\s>
<s> If we learn many academic subjects it increases our knowledge by having a good command on all subjects . <\s>
<s> There are many myriad reasons to support the above statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If many academic subjects are studied then we can gather more information about any subject and we can be brave ourselves in facing any problems or questions regarding a particular subject if asked by anyone . <\s>
<s> Good researches can be done on any subject by picking one subject from different academic subjects what we have learnt . <\s>
<s> If any topic is concerned to some other subject what we have learnt then we can have an idea . <\s>
<s> The main reason of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that we can settle in any of the fields i.e in a good job related to the subjects what we have learnt . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If a person specializes in only one subject then he can become expert only in that particular subject and has poor knowledge if the questions are asked apart from his subject . <\s>
<s> So in this world day by day the knowledge is increasing a lot so the people should also have keen interest in increasing their knowlegde to the peak level . <\s>
<s> Otherwise they ca n't compete with the students now a days . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Each and every student should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects to settle in their life . <\s>
<s> It is considered as important part to the student life by not sticking to only on subject and becoming expert in that one and only one subject . <\s>
<s> Having broad knowledge to discover many things in many subjects adds success to our life like the way scientists do . <\s>
<s> So good knowledge in different subjects leads to good maturity among different subjects . <\s>
<s> In this way i agree to the statement to have broad knowledge and not to specialize in only one specific subject . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because one subject is n't enough information . <\s>
<s> With all the broad knowledge of many academic subjects we are studying , it 's been experimented that we only use 1 % of our brain . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We should know about everything going on around us , if we specialize on one specific subject it will affect our future , the technologies , and we 'd be missing on alot . <\s>
<s> God gave as a brain for a reason . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example if you choose to concentrate on Physics , you ca n't study phyics without taking Algebra . <\s>
<s> You could study many academic subjects but concentrate on ur favorite subject more , this way you wont be missing on anything . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Imagine a world with no doctors , engineers or business . <\s>
<s> Disease 's would spread because their wont be any cures for them . <\s>
<s> People would live in the streets , and there wo n't be any street except a sandy dirty place . <\s>
<s> People would fight over anything they find because it does n't belong to anyone , and there 's no grocery store or any shops . <\s>
<s> Therefore alot of people will commite suicide , because there wont be anything to do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Studying many academic subjects is n't alot , you have 12 years of studying in school that is more than enough . <\s>
<s> Then you graduate and go to University , you will still study there but less hours . <\s>
<s> You would be majored in any of you 're favoured topics and the rest would only help finishing you 're credits and wasting time so you would n't get bored . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Me myself I 'm a very lazy person and I would preffer if we do n't study academic subjects , but if you think about it for a few seconds and imagine how you 're life would be you will imaditely change you mind , because there wo n't be anything to complain on and life would be useless . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with this statment that is , in my personal vision , the most important thing that a student should learn as soon as possible , also during the elementary classes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To learn maths formulas , historical dates , to memorize poems ... <\s>
<s> is important ? <\s>
<s> Yes , but only in a short term ! <\s>
<s> For a student is mor important understant the reasons why that there are behind that has studied , overall considering his future , his professional life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays , in fact , with the globalization , with the new tecnologies ( such as th worldwide well-know , the world wide web , internet ) and with the fast available of all the informations the real skill is not to know a fact , to be updated about the main issue all around the world ; There is a new verb in English tongue : to google , that means to find informations in a fast way : this operation is easy , is not necessary a particular knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The real skill is an other . <\s>
<s> To apply own knowledge in a particular field , to achieve an adding value . <\s>
<s> What I mean speaking of adding value ? <\s>
<s> Considering , for example a marketing department for a modern enterprise , I think that the person that follow the product that will be market for the final consumer , called product manager , do not apply only the concepts learn at the university in his project works , but should create an innovative way to push the products thinking to the real necessity of the persons and finding a solution to resolve them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this example , there is the main consideration that a student , when was at school or at university should think : do not memorize or learn only to have a good result in the short term ( in a test , for example ) , but for a better reason , in the long term : to find more way to find a solutions or to create new projects . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the following statement . <\s>
<s> I think that there will be more cars then it uses to be in twenty years for the following reasons . <\s>
<s> First , I believe that developing countries and cities will get an increasing of their cars in a few year . <\s>
<s> For instance , prospection of Mexico or Sao Paolo demonstrates that the traffic will get bigger and intense in a few year . <\s>
<s> More people are goin In my opinion , cars tend to be a symbol and will still be a symbol of wealthy and success people . <\s>
<s> Second , even if oil prices are getting up and oil reserves are diminishing , people will never stop using their cars . <\s>
<s> For examples , in the United-States people can not live without cars because public transports have not been developed adquately by the government . <\s>
<s> It is necessary for a middle class familly to possess one or two cars and they used it on a daily base . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , even if oil reserves are being reduced , scientists try already to find some alternativ to petrole . <\s>
<s> In fact bio-carburant will be prehaps the new carburant for our cars . <\s>
<s> Now , new kinds of carburants that are made of bee or others cropswill interest car concessioners . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , I think that if we do not find any alternative to move from one city to another , cars will still be used a lot even in twenty years . <\s>
<s> People often discuss whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I strongly believe that successful people tend to face and challenge new things and tasks rather than doing one things they can do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , those who are changing constantly can succeed now . <\s>
<s> Some people think that doing one thing continuously is more efficient than doing many things . <\s>
<s> However , It is now not available . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , everything is so fast and complexed . <\s>
<s> So people can easily feel boring at same thing . <\s>
<s> For example , as many people know , the rock group ` Radiohead ' is still popular . <\s>
<s> They have been singing for more than ten years . <\s>
<s> there were many popular rock groups at that time . <\s>
<s> Radiohead changed their music style and challenged new things that people have never heard . <\s>
<s> If they had stock to their one style of music , they could not have continued their populization . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , challenging new things and face new tasks are more exciting and refreshing . <\s>
<s> Only doing onething makes people feel boring and lazy . <\s>
<s> people who are lazy can not be better than those who are exciting to do something . <\s>
<s> suppose that you have to eat hambuger everyday . <\s>
<s> Even if the hambugers are delicious , you would be sick of having same food . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , While people challenge new thing people can learn new skill . <\s>
<s> we do not need to try something which we already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> Also we need to try many things because , nowadays , we need many skills . <\s>
<s> In the past time , the world was not large for people . <\s>
<s> It was local society . <\s>
<s> However , we can not succeed with only one skilled ability because the world are huge and complicated . <\s>
<s> If you know that how to use computers , then you need to try something else . <\s>
<s> It will give you new skills and more oppotunity to succeed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Talking all of things into account , it is sure that successful people tend to challenge new things and face new risks rather that only doing one thing because it is more efficient , refreshing and skillful . <\s>
<s> Most students think that it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts in order to allow them to use them again in their future life . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , others think that it is more important for them to learn facts because history is made of facts , and facts are the results of the use of such ideas or concepts . <\s>
<s> However , in the final analysis , I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , the fact to understand ideas and concepts is the most important requirement that teachers ask their students to do . <\s>
<s> For example , after a class , every student will have taken notes on the main facts of the lecture and would be able to learn them back home ; but only a few could say that they understood all the ideas and concepts of the lecture . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , there is a difference between understand and learn . <\s>
<s> If almost everybody is able to learn some facts , such as dates , everybody is not able to understand ideas and concepts , and replace them in a context or apply in other cases and situations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but not least , people that have understood ideas and concepts have the possibility to apply them . <\s>
<s> If we consider that facts are the results or the consequences of the involvement of someone 's ideas , you can deduce that the most important is to remember the way to achieve this result . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I am firmly conviced that the most important for students is to learn how to think through the understanding of ideas and concepts rather than learn <\s>
<s> First and foremost let me try to put on the focus of the terms : in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I do believe that will be true . <\s>
<s> Actually , in the future , in the Earth , the level of pollution will be very great , the air will be bad and this for the car 's pollution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even today in the big cities there is the problem of pollution because on the streets there are a big number of cars from the morning to the evening . <\s>
<s> The people use the cars to go to the work place , because is too far . <\s>
<s> A small number of workers , now , can go to work by tram or bus because the lines are too short and so they ca n't arrive with the public object at the final place . <\s>
<s> Also , only few workers can go by bycicle because the street is too long . <\s>
<s> This only for the workers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The students , instead , can take the train , but this is always in late . <\s>
<s> So a boy or a girl goes by car . <\s>
<s> Now I do an example that make my idea concrete : when I go to university , I 'm always in late because the train is in late ( everyday ) !!! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If in the future , the government will decide to increase the train 's lines , the tram 's lines and the metro 's lines , so that these will can arrive in time , more people will take these objects and not the cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I hope that in the future the air will be less dirty than today ; I hope this also for my future children and for all kids . <\s>
<s> To conclude , I do believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are now , or perhaps I hope this one . <\s>
<s> I agree to the statement . <\s>
<s> If you think , speak , and behave like any other people or in the routinal way you are used to , then how could you make changes and reach the top ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , being successful means different to everyone . <\s>
<s> For me , being successful means being one of the top , without regard to the field or area you are in . <\s>
<s> A successful businessman is one of the most influential leaders in the field of managing and administrating an enterprise . <\s>
<s> A successful pianist is one of the most revered musicians and plays the piano more accurately , at the same time gracefully , than others . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For instance , Hee-ya , a 19-year-old girl with only four fingers , is now a successful pianist in Korea . <\s>
<s> Her performance may not be as good as Mozart ; but the thing is , despite the harsh circumstance , she became one of the prospective pianists in Korea . <\s>
<s> She would not have gained the fame and recognition , had she given up and blamed the situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The potential to succeed is not born with ; it 's all about grabbing as many opportunities as one can and doing things that usual people do not even think about . <\s>
<s> The issue of that life is more appreciates by the young people rather than old people is a controversial one . <\s>
<s> On the one hand when a person is old she appreciate life in a better way . <\s>
<s> On the other hand certain young people consider that youth must discover lifer rather than studie . <\s>
<s> However , in the final analysis I believe that an older people enjoy life more than certain young people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the reasons of my belief is that studies are too important to be sacrified by an edonist behaviour . <\s>
<s> Indeed , every person who made studie and who have had a knowledge enjoy life with benefict . <\s>
<s> More than a person who decides to leave studie for enjoy life . <\s>
<s> The abbility of speaking different languages is the greatest example . <\s>
<s> To my mind enjoy life would say bring to another people with another culture and another language . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another way to justify my point of view is that life experience allows to discover more subtilities of life . <\s>
<s> For instance love deception , familly death allow to take the time to discover and apprecaite life . <\s>
<s> Generaly is not the case of young people . <\s>
<s> The life experience bring some knowledge or behaviour that it is impossible to learn without experience . <\s>
<s> It is probably a empirical pompous speech , but for me experience is very important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but not least , I am firmly convinced that the life is very interesting to discover but with money this become amazzing . <\s>
<s> When I say that I think particulaly to trip abrove in some part of the world . <\s>
<s> For example a trip in Asia for an occidental person allows to discover a new culture and to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> However this trip is impossible without money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For all these reasons I believe that the age and the experience are necessary to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> In fact , we can not pass our young years to studie and wait to discover the world and , by the occaion the life , but it is an hisytory of compromise . <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned from my own life ; young people really enjoy life more than elderly people . <\s>
<s> Having fun from life is a wide range area for debating . <\s>
<s> However ; fun is a fun ! <\s>
<s> Needless to say young people do it in a more efficient way in their whole lifes . <\s>
<s> We can see it from many examples from thir life styles . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly ; there is an energy inside young people for doing many activities . <\s>
<s> They really want to learn life by trying different and excited activities . <\s>
<s> Most of them are enjoyable ones which show differentiation in different people . <\s>
<s> By way of illustration ; driving faslty is an exciting hobby for young people . <\s>
<s> However it is too hazardeous . <\s>
<s> Therefore old people do not want to this as a hobby for living more ! <\s>
<s> Eventually they know the risk of it 's results . <\s>
<s> Anyway it is an enjoyable activity in closed areas . <\s>
<s> Is n't it ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly ; young people are rather interested in technology instead of using the ancient models of technology . <\s>
<s> It has many enjoyable products like play station ; computer games ; cell phones ... <\s>
<s> etc . <\s>
<s> Young people would like to buy new products ; whereas the elderly people could not get accustom to the new technology . <\s>
<s> Thus : they use the old models until they broke . <\s>
<s> Playing a play station game has been my best hobby since my child times . <\s>
<s> You really become more relax than anytime in your life . <\s>
<s> Because its games include interesting characters and also places which you have never seen before . <\s>
<s> However ; according to elderly people it is a waste of time . <\s>
<s> Isn ` t it a boring thought ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude ; the life is too short ; then why we do n't enjoy for feeling more happy and relax ? <\s>
<s> I think older people could not think the importance of enjoy . <\s>
<s> They may be do some enjoyable events but presumably it is not enjoyable for younger people . <\s>
<s> It is high time that they should enjoy life ! <\s>
<s> I think that I disagree with the following statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' to an extent . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would only agree to this statement under certain conditions . <\s>
<s> Cars would only decrease in twenty years if the crude oil diminishes by that time , I think . <\s>
<s> Not only if it diminishes but also if it was scarce or difficult to drain out due to the lack equipments to reach far or sense such small quantity . <\s>
<s> I say that petrol is important because with it out cars wont move . <\s>
<s> In addition to that if this occurs the petrol price might rise and only moderate to wealthy people can afford having a car with such high expenses . <\s>
<s> I would add to that that if rude oil does decrease or diminish less factories and electrical generations would stop working and by that less classical cars would be produced . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , I dont really think that within 20 years this is going to happen , I hope . <\s>
<s> As i see it , for the past three to four years the cars innovation and availability in markets with various shapes , modalities sizes and brands has been increasing non stop . <\s>
<s> For instance In Jordan which is a middle east country that is considered moderate non developed countries have had a dramatic increase in cars as its sseen in traffic jams that has been increasing each year more than the other . <\s>
<s> Not to forget mentioning the Gulf region where each family member who is licensed to drive owns his own car . <\s>
<s> Cars for guys in this region is their main obsession . <\s>
<s> Oman was considered one of the quite Gulf countries that was known for it wide empty roads for the past year its been having several rush time hours from initially starting with 2 rush our times on the way to and from work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ultimately , I anticipate an increase in cars on roads and in each house , 20 years from now based on what I see today . <\s>
<s> I also think that maybe by that time new cars that are not petrol fuel consumers might be invented and in efficient use . <\s>
<s> There was car invented that works on helium gas instead of petrol and I heard that it was seen in One of the sstreet in some western country that i cant recall it now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In case crude oil was to finish , I have hope that scientist will create alternative sources of energy such as the solar power to provide us a normal sophisticated life life . <\s>
<s> It is important that everybody enjoys their lives . <\s>
<s> But who enjoys more , young people or older people ? <\s>
<s> In my opinion , older people enjoys their lives more because they know what the true enjoyment and freedom to do anything . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , adults enjoy their lives more because they are more experienced and know what the true enjoyment is . <\s>
<s> Youngsters call playing computer games , going to the movies and partying with friends enjoying life . <\s>
<s> However it is too small to be an enjoyment of one 's life . <\s>
<s> Older people enjoys their lives in a greater range . <\s>
<s> For example , a head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit , directing people and going to dinner with his family , which are far more enjoyable that playing computer games . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , Adults have a freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy . <\s>
<s> For youngsters to enjoy their lives , there are numerous thing that are not permitted to do , such as drinking , traveling without parents . <\s>
<s> However , there is no such barrier for adults . <\s>
<s> For example , my uncle is now 38 years old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stresses he got from his business . <\s>
<s> Then he told me that he would go to these beutiful places and would come back with better future . <\s>
<s> I , after listening to him , immediately thought of all the stress that I am getting from school and planned a travel alone . <\s>
<s> However , I could not make the trip because of my parent 's disagreement . <\s>
<s> From that moment I deeply realized that I can enjoy my life when I grow up . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People say that enjoyment equals happiness . <\s>
<s> However , it is not always true . <\s>
<s> People can get fall into a trouble if they only seek for pleasure . <\s>
<s> This happens to young people a lot . <\s>
<s> However , older people are able to differentiate between enjoyment and temporary pleasure because they know more and experienced more , which is why they allowed more freedom . <\s>
<s> Therefore , older people enjoy there lives more . <\s>
<s> There are too many different ways for a student to learnd and undesrtand different kind of topics , but there is huge difference between understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , the fact that a students it 's only understanding the concepts it mean he is learning . <\s>
<s> Understanding is the base of education , and the base of knowledge . <\s>
<s> For example , if one student has a test , and he memorize everything , he migh be good at the test , but weeks later , if you ask him about the same topic and if he is not able to answer any question about the topic , that means that he did n't learn anything about it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , understanding ideas is the best way for learning , and remember different facts . <\s>
<s> For example , when you are able to understand some topic , and you are able to answer any question about it , that mean that you actually learn something about , maybe not everything but just what you thougt it was important for you . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , the main reason why students now a days feel confortable when their are going to present any kind of test or exam , is because they undesrtood what they read and the undesrtood the main idea of the subject or topic they where asked to study . <\s>
<s> For example , when a student has his final exam and he was all night studing and he did good on his test , that 's because he undestood most of the information , and that 's one of the most important things for a student to be succesfull . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclution , i totally agree with the statement because I think that by understanding the ideas and the concept you could better learn they way that thing happened , and by that you could understand the facts . <\s>
<s> If you learn , it 's because you understood . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concepts will make you learn about everything you want , whenever you want . <\s>
<s> I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> Because young people can do many things which they want . <\s>
<s> Young people play many games which older people cant do . <\s>
<s> Young people rome every where but older people cant because according to their age their stamina will be decreased . <\s>
<s> Young people have much stamina to do everything . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The thinking of young people goes with the present generation which older person cant do . <\s>
<s> For example a young person know much about computer and new softwares . <\s>
<s> But older people they dont know and they dont need also . <\s>
<s> A young person can play games to be healthy but a older person , they have to do exercise to be healthy because they cant play all games against the youth . <\s>
<s> As a people goes old , they behave vey matured . <\s>
<s> Young person behaves as a child sometimes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people can enjoy the new technologies and new things in the market . <\s>
<s> They can get all advantages and make easier all works . <\s>
<s> Older person cant enjoy with that new technology or science because they have over come with many things in their lives . <\s>
<s> Young people go to college , office , parties where they can entertain themselves in many ways . <\s>
<s> But older people cant . <\s>
<s> Because they have already enjoyed their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people dont have any responsibilty and stress of family . <\s>
<s> Older people have responsibility and stress with ahich they cant enjoy . <\s>
<s> They did n't get time after all responsibilities to enjoy . <\s>
<s> And one thing what older people can do young people cant do . <\s>
<s> Once in my life i struck in a position that i was not able to solve that problem . <\s>
<s> That time my grand father handle with that problem and solved . <\s>
<s> It clearly tell that young people enjoy life when older people take care of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people walk with the present life , fashion , styles . <\s>
<s> Young people enjoy walking with the generation . <\s>
<s> Older people are simple and make generetion to walk properly . <\s>
<s> In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I disagree with this ides . <\s>
<s> I will explain why I disagree with it providing two reasons . <\s>
<s> These two reasons are a condition of car campanies and a condition of roads nowaday . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of car campanies are creating new types of cars . <\s>
<s> Every time I watch TV , I see many now comercials about new type of cars that are introduced by various campanies . <\s>
<s> On the street , I see many advertisements of cars are hung on the walls . <\s>
<s> In Japan , which is my home country , the two biggest car campanies are Toyota and Honda . <\s>
<s> Two days ago , I heard on the news that these two campanies are fighting each other and trying to make new car to attract customers ' attentions . <\s>
<s> If car campanies make new model of car , people will be attracted to it and want to get it . <\s>
<s> If people buy new car , they will ride it . <\s>
<s> Nobody will keep it in their car parking . <\s>
<s> Of course , all of people will want to show it how cool their cars are by rideing them . <\s>
<s> If 100 people bought new cars , there would be 100 cars in use . <\s>
<s> After people buy new cars , they would sell their old cars . <\s>
<s> These old cars would be sold by cheap price in the used car shop . <\s>
<s> People who have not enough money to buy new car would buy these used cars , then more and more cars would be on the road . <\s>
<s> By these reasons , I think that the condition of car campanies has been increasing the number of cars in use today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason , which I suppose is a condition of roads . <\s>
<s> New roads are made in everywhere and their qualities are quite good . <\s>
<s> They are smooth and are connected to other roads . <\s>
<s> Therefore , people are able to change their distination while they are riding car on the roads . <\s>
<s> If they are on the way to their distination using train , they ca n't change their distination as immediately as they can by the road . <\s>
<s> Even if they can change , they will have to buy new ticket to ride new train . <\s>
<s> It will cause money problem . <\s>
<s> In addition , roads are everywhere . <\s>
<s> In Japan , roads are located even under the ocean . <\s>
<s> Impressionable condition of the roads reduce the time to be spent to go to the distination and also save a lot of money . <\s>
<s> These points make people want to by cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From these two reasons that I explain above , I think that there will be a lot of cars in us <\s>
<s> As great people say `` Nothing is permanent in this materialistic world '' . <\s>
<s> with the change in time there will be rapid change in the technologies and the life style of the humanbeing . <\s>
<s> A Car is a immediate next productive invention man made after many other small , less capacity seater , less expensive automobiles . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars were considered costly as the mode of transport needed lot of fuel and which was always costly from the ages of automobile invention . <\s>
<s> But as the rates of the cars began to decrease simultaneously the fuel rates began to increase . <\s>
<s> if the situation can be mathematically expressed it can be done by stating that the price of the vehicle and the fuel rate are inversely proportional to each other . <\s>
<s> As fuel increases price of the car decreases . <\s>
<s> In the early period of modernisation only the rich people attempted for the maintainance of this vehicle . <\s>
<s> But as the cars prices are decreasing day by day , people who are gaining their position financiallly are in the thought of maintaining one . <\s>
<s> Though we cant expect a frequent usage of these cars due to the increase in the fuel rates , people are opting for showoff business . <\s>
<s> There is no doubt there will be more number of cars than they are in the present year . <\s>
<s> It is very clear from the above explanation that the population of cars increase but usage will be nil . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The roads will be widened more for the free movement of the traffic . <\s>
<s> Becoz a time comes where each and every person who is earning will be in a state to maintain a four wheeler . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By this wierd behaviour of man it would be difficult for us to come to a conclusion of what exactly man has in his mind and what would be the future of the cars and other automobiles . <\s>
<s> to end up with the essay <\s>
<s> Indeed , most advertisments make their products seem much better than they usually are for a few different reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , it is an advertisers job to sell a specific product . <\s>
<s> For this to work , the advertisment has to look attractive to the buyer . <\s>
<s> The buyer has to think that this product will change the course of his or her life , that it is essentiel for him to achieve one of his multiple goals : happiness . <\s>
<s> This is why adverts look amazing . <\s>
<s> They are colourful , smart , funny and appealing to anyone , who is for example interested in fashion . <\s>
<s> Indeed , a lot of fashion addicts ' attention is caught by publicity and avertisments because all them think about is looking more attractive , hipper or simply , better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The averts have phrases that are cleakish and once a person has heard one of them , it stays in his mind . <\s>
<s> The consummer might not think of it at the time , but his mind will remember it . <\s>
<s> One day , the person will pass by the product , of which he saw the advertisment , in a super market , and will , for example , say to himself that he remembers the name of the product . <\s>
<s> In the end , he will buy the product just because the name recalled something to him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , advertisements always point out the positive aspects of what they are selling , without mentioning the negative side effects . <\s>
<s> So , consummers think there are no side effects and they often go to buy the product without thinking if it is really a good idea to get the product or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Avertisemnts always vent the new and outstanding characteristics of their products . <\s>
<s> And , innovations are frequently viewed as beneficial by people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end , advertisments make the products seem much better than they really a <\s>
<s> Thesedays , a lot of cars are made in whole world . <\s>
<s> Many people use a car for everything . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree in the twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> It is because moer people need to use a car . <\s>
<s> we always usea cars . <\s>
<s> If you go to school or working place , you must take a car . <\s>
<s> Car is comfortable and fast . <\s>
<s> Also , I want a car because my school is so far , I can not go to walk my shcool . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> More developing cars make more safe and comfortable and fast for people . <\s>
<s> For example , BMW 's car is atomatically turn on the light at night . <\s>
<s> We can go anywhere take a car in the world . <\s>
<s> Some people like to tavelling by car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , many car cmopanies are inventing a water car becase of environment pollution and fossil fule . <\s>
<s> They are tring to find new enegy such as solar , water . <\s>
<s> These are wherever we can save easily . <\s>
<s> After few years , we can see a solar car or water car and than also see a flight car like movies . <\s>

<s> There is an argument regarding whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Personally , I agree with the statement for the following reasons . <\s>
<s> First , broad knowledge will discover one 's potential talents . <\s>
<s> Also , it leads people to grow deeply from many aspects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First and foremost , knowledge from the variety of field will help people to find potential telents . <\s>
<s> In today 's society , many schools offer as much subjects as possible for the students . <\s>
<s> That is largely because there are plenty of poeple who has not known what they want to be . <\s>
<s> In this case , broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a good experience for the one 's future . <\s>
<s> they can learn variety of subject and choose their major from it . <\s>
<s> To be specific , my brother always dreamed of dentist however after he experience many academic subjects , he realized that he has more talents in astronomy rather than dentist . <\s>
<s> It turns out , he enjoys his job and always tell me that `` people should learn from variety of subjects to discover what they really want '' . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the knowledge from diverse area is crucial for developing one 's telents <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What is more , broad knowledge allow people to grow into more desirable person . <\s>
<s> Thesedays , it is common sense that being a specialist in one area is the key for the success . <\s>
<s> However , those person are success is not appropriate . <\s>
<s> Although they finalcially succeed , many specialists have problems with some issue that he does not majored . <\s>
<s> According to a recently released survey by the korean national reaserch center , more than 40 percent of specialists have problem with socializations . <\s>
<s> the research shows that these people tend to self-esteem due to their notion that they are much better than others . <\s>
<s> Therefore , having broad knowledge lead people to develop in variety aspects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , having broad knowledge of many subjects are more crucial than to be specialize in one subject because they will discovoer one 's skills and potential telent and lead people to g <\s>
<s> `` Must advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Products now a days are very difficult to be positioned in a good market or in a good level of selling because of the huge marketing and the number of unsatisfied clients , so I agree with the statement that much advertisements make products seem much better than they really are becuase in most of the times is necesary . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today having a good marketing area in your business and with your products is really important because we have many prodcuts alike and the clients demand a very good product and a new one or a better one in short lapsus of time . <\s>
<s> Today you have to have the most brilliant proposal and idea to show to the market so the people will buy your products beliving that it is the best one even though it is not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The media plays a very important role at the marketing area and that is were the especialists tend to exagerate the cuality of the product making very impressive and clever anouncements that make and play with clients minds reminding the product as the best one because of the good impression they saw or heard or read , it is all about the first impression . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advertisiemnts job in this field is to compite and be better than the other same products in the same market and to make an idea or an impression in the clients about the product so he or she would make the product it `` s favorite one , of course there are some businesses that do n't need these kind of treaky publicity and they just sell the prodcut as it is , but most of the time it is more effective to have a good advertisement and a good publicity to present your product and making it the numbre one of the merket . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisements make products semm much better tan tey really are and that is were the product makes the boom . <\s>
<s> It is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts . <\s>
<s> In our society , most students are attending schools and learn many things such as Math , Science , and English . <\s>
<s> Based on what students learn from the schools is fact , but they must understand the concepts and ideas of the lessons first . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Understand ideas and concepts require more importance than the facts . <\s>
<s> Once they complete to comprehend the ideas and concepts , the way they study is easier and faster . <\s>
<s> For example , in a biology class , there are student who is used to analyze the ideas and concepts first than the facts and the student who valus the fact more than the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> The student ( fact ) will be struggling with memorizing all the functions of human 's body and will spend plenty of time to finish it . <\s>
<s> However , as mentioned above , once the student understand how the each functions of human body work , it is easy to memorize . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the study may be fun and enjoyable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Learning the fact will stay less period than the undertanding ideas and concepts because people just memorizing the fact without understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> It is easy to forget . <\s>
<s> Once people get the concepts of the lessons , it is in your brain , and logically it will stay longer than just learning a fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence , it is more crucial for student to understand ideas and concepts than the facts . <\s>
<s> Once they get the concept , it is easy to study and stays longer in your head than the understanding the fact . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the following statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because our world is packed with information to learn and to understand . <\s>
<s> Also to get an idea of something like an animal we need facts and not ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First main point is , that our world consists of information and anything is filled with information . <\s>
<s> Facts are easier to learn . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , sometimes it is also an advantage to know the idea and concept behind a project or a war . <\s>
<s> To illustrate , I like to know the facts and not to imagine why and what the reason for the war was . <\s>
<s> Aditionally , the only thing people and I have to know are the facts . <\s>
<s> I take the war as an example . <\s>
<s> Many people are talking about what the idea behind the war was , but that is not interesting , just when it started and how many boats the Americans had and when the D-day really was . <\s>
<s> The idea behind all those things I really dont want to know . <\s>
<s> Facts can also learn me to learn . <\s>
<s> For example , I sit at home and have to learn French . <\s>
<s> Although the language is difficult , I do not ask me the question how the language could have had such a evolution , I just learn it . <\s>
<s> Fact by fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second main point why I disagree with the shown statement is , eventhought information and concepts are good or helpful , I never learn everything right . <\s>
<s> To learn I need facts and not curios ideas and silly answers . <\s>
<s> For example in school , all the teacher learn us facts and not ideas . <\s>
<s> To know something about a flour or a lake , a ocean or an animal I and all the other people need the facts to understand the topic of what we are sudying . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think everyone need both like ideas and concepts and facts , but to step up in our life I need to learn and to learn you need facts . <\s>
<s> Facts are the base for our knowledge . <\s>
<s> Thats the reason why I disagree . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of reasons to support this statement , but , in the other hand , there are also a lot of reasons to show big disadvantages in this type of knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , at the day of today , it 's very important to have a good specialization in evry type of work . <\s>
<s> In fact more and more specializations are required in jobs related not only to high tecnologies but also in all type of work , from office worker to scientist . <\s>
<s> If you are specialized in your work you will reach better positions and certainly you will have a big pay . <\s>
<s> But there is also a big disadvantage in this type of specialization . <\s>
<s> In fact in that way you often do n't know some important things also related to your work as a result of the type of study that you have had . <\s>
<s> And there are a lot of situations in which only a more large view of the problem could solve it better than a specialized one . <\s>
<s> Another big disadvantage is that it 's certainly better to have a knowledge of a wide range of subjects because it allows you to understand real society and the real knowledge of human beings . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is useless have a very specialized understanding of complex arguments if you do n't understand all others things . <\s>
<s> So I am convinced that with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can live in a better way , because you are really aware of the society that surround you . <\s>
<s> For example , having only knowledge based on technic you do n't have cultural informations about art and literature and so on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And , in conclusion , the clever man is not the one that knows all of something , but the one that know something of all . <\s>
<s> Acc . <\s>
<s> to me a student should focus more on ideas and concepts than on learning concepts because if he will know the idea & concepts he will be able to apply his learnings in his practical & normal life rather focussing on facts . <\s>
<s> By knoowing the idea & concepts , he can check & approve the practality of a learning . <\s>
<s> But in the case of facts he has to follow them blindly like a theoritical essay . <\s>
<s> Also by knowing the ideas , he can use them formaking basics of other related subjects & can continue to researchs on the basis of concepts & make his own learned facts . <\s>
<s> But in case of facts , he wont be able to go out his bounded area of learned fact & continue to follow on the same & wont be able to explore & prove his facts . <\s>
<s> This will kill a student 's curiousity & he will become a follower not a leader . <\s>
<s> there wont be any pace in his life . <\s>
<s> He will continue to work on same old facts . <\s>
<s> But by knowing the ideas & concepts , he can come close to the practacility of a topic & it will become a learning for his life . <\s>
<s> These ideas & concepts broaden the mind of a student to think & develope more but in case of facts , these narrowed the emrging thinking of a learning student . <\s>
<s> by learning ideas & concepts , he can lead them to a certified notion by producing practical results but in case of facts , he will not be boter to work any more on that because it will be a so called proff to him . <\s>
<s> So focus on idaes 7 CONCE <\s>
<s> Cars Using With In The 20 Years <\s>
<s> In twenty years there will be less cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I strongly agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> In twenty yearss people must be responsible about their environment and they can reduce to use bad things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays , thechnology development very fast , No one think about , twenty years ago , to use an internet and to reach milions of knowledge less than one minute , And i can believe that in twenty years we use different veichles differ from the cars . <\s>
<s> We have to because we have lots of reasons to do it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , oil stock is almost finishing and the scientist seek out the alternative energy supplies . <\s>
<s> So , not maybe in twenty years but it occurs very soon , we can use different transportation . <\s>
<s> It is very nice to use different things . <\s>
<s> Secondly , people knows that this type of transportation cause a pollution . <\s>
<s> Not only damage the environment but also the people influence it . <\s>
<s> Therefore peole get sick very easily . <\s>
<s> If we don not give back bad environment to the children , we have to solve this problem . <\s>
<s> Moreover , cars also cause a traffic problems everyday . <\s>
<s> When you are live in a big city , in the morning it is too difficult to go to work . <\s>
<s> Sometimes when the traffic too heavy , it takse two hours to go work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , scientists are working a different types of transportation , Forexample they can use solar energy and they try to make a different veichles . <\s>
<s> Maybe in twenty years people start to use this type of veichles . <\s>
<s> Why not ? <\s>
<s> It can be excitement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , in twenty years people use fewer cars than today . <\s>
<s> Because of lots of reasons as i mention it . <\s>
<s> Important part is if we want to live a wonderfull life , we have to reduce to using of cars . <\s>
<s> And try to use to safety and envorimental friendly t <\s>
<s> i disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> i think that to understand ideas and concepts is very important , but i think also that to learn facts are not less important thant ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> they are at least at the same level . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> i think that ideas and concepts are at the base of a theory and so they are at the base of our knowledge , but sometimes facts can replace and modify the original theory , so it is important to know real facts ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In Italy there is a famous affermation that is `` la migliore teoria e ' la pratica '' that can be translate in english with `` the best theory is the real pratice '' , and i think that this affermation represent perfectly my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In our world there are a lot of jobs that need a lot of experience , and experience can be `` reached '' only by facts rather than with ideas and concepts , that they are also important of course , but without facts nobody can `` reach '' an high amout of experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example is a normal math exam : to prepare a math exam we ca n't only study theory on the theory book , we must do a lot of exercise if we wont to understand how the theory is used in realty , or at least how the theory is used in the exercise that will be in the exam . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> in the end , I dont know if my thought about the importance for students to learn facts is condivided by all other people , because I know that there can be a lot of people that thought that is important only to understand ideas and concepts , but that is my opinion and I think that is right . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take rist rather than only doing things they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> But is it only possible to do new things and take risk when you have enough money ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Normal things like go to the cinema or make a travel in the own land is to boring for these people . <\s>
<s> Maybe they have also made these things and now they want to see some others . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I also think that these people do these crazy things because they are affraid of loosing there money or do not be rich for a long time . <\s>
<s> So in these short time they want to see as much as they can and take the chance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Normally rich people are in a rich society . <\s>
<s> These people do not want to speak about a film you saw last week in the cinema . <\s>
<s> They want to hear about your last adventure trip in Thailand or something like that . <\s>
<s> Some things you can only make when you have enogh money . <\s>
<s> And I think that anybody wants to make so special things but have no money for that . <\s>
<s> So it would be only a dream . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But I also think that it is better to have some dreams and go working for it , as you have the money and can not join the special thing . <\s>
<s> For rich people many things are normal , to normal . <\s>
<s> They think driving a big car and make an adventure trip every half year is as normal as eating and drinking . <\s>
<s> When people have to much money , so much money that they do not know what to do with it , they often do not get enough from all and that is why they take risks to be happy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think people who have to much money should give it to an organizations who give it to poor people for which is it not normal to eat or drink . <\s>
<s> Travelin With a Tour Guide <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although traveling with a tour guide is interesting , but traveling alone is more fun because of many reasons such as , a tour guide is more expensive , the commitment with the tour guide , and speaking the country language is enough to travel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Traveling with a tour guide is more expensive . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , if people want to travel , they can find all the information about the place that they will go to in the internet or book guides . <\s>
<s> It is cheaper and they can discover the places by themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is no commitment by traveling without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I had a Europe trip last summer and i travelled without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I went there with my friends and we used the book guides it was really helpful and fun rather than traveling with a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Because the tour guide have specific times that people have to follow , they are not quite interesting . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Speaking the country language is enough . <\s>
<s> My native language is Arabic , and i like to visit Arabic Countries such as , Egypt , United Emirates , and Lebanon . <\s>
<s> I always visiting a travel agent before i went to these countries and he gave me guides about the good places in these counitries , so i did not need a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is interesing . <\s>
<s> People can learn more about the countries and the places if they have a tour guide . <\s>
<s> The tour guides can show the toursit all the historical places that they want to see , and they can explain the places for the tourist . <\s>
<s> They can save tourist time because they know the places , so they show the tourist many places in short amount of time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the best way to travel is different between each person . <\s>
<s> Many people prefer to travel by themselves , and discover the places and live the adventure without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> This kind of tourist want to be free , so they can go any place at any time without commitment . <\s>
<s> TO BE SUCCESSFULL <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion succes is not same for all people . <\s>
<s> It can change in which are it is gained and people have different feelings about the area which they are successfull in . <\s>
<s> However ; for me it is true that successfull people can do the best while they are trying new things and if they take risk although the area which the success is gained changes from person to person . <\s>
<s> This is true because of three reason . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , successfull people used to working and studying and they wonder what happened around them . <\s>
<s> Thus , they try different things which they wonder . <\s>
<s> For instance , the engineers of a big company always try to find new products to sell . <\s>
<s> In other saying , the company is big because of successfull engineers . <\s>
<s> The engineers are successfull because they are not doing the usual work in company . <\s>
<s> They are trying to find new areas which they are not already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , successfulll people are interested in everything . <\s>
<s> They read different kinds of books , they watch different types of programms and as a result of this , they know so much about different ares . <\s>
<s> So they can find varios type of innovations . <\s>
<s> If we look at the researches in the world , people who have different looking to the problems or the events are generally successful in their job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , successful people try to solve problems with different solutions . <\s>
<s> The person who has a second solution for a problem usually successfull . <\s>
<s> This is because of their decides . <\s>
<s> A person who has a second or third solution means that he or she can take risk at least one time to solve the problem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Take what I have mentioned above into consideration , success comes with trying new things , with interested in different areas and with taking risk . <\s>
<s> The world today is exploding with the techonlogical advancements made . <\s>
<s> The major factor which has completely transformed the face of the world were is the advancement in the transportation industry . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The automobile industry plays a vital role in the current world where the people are able to travel more in a very less time . <\s>
<s> What took some days of travel in the olden days now only takes a few hours and what took few hours earlier now inly take few minutes . <\s>
<s> All Thanks to the automobile industry which has wiped off the distances . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The automobile industry has grown rapidly in the past century . <\s>
<s> One of the bacis ways of transport is the buses , Vans , and not to mention the cars . <\s>
<s> Earlier in the early twentieth century cars were more of a status symbol . <\s>
<s> There were not many people who owned a car . <\s>
<s> In the later part of the century they cars have come to the comfort level . <\s>
<s> But in the current day Cars are for more than comfort but they have become a necessecity . <\s>
<s> As such we see that there are more noumber of cars on the streets than earlier . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The major factors which has raised the usability of cars is that there are more number of providers and people have a lot of options to choose in every budget range . <\s>
<s> The people have become more busier than ever and so they want their personal means of transport to save their time and cars offer them this . <\s>
<s> Also there are more number of service centers avaliable all acroos the country which is why we are seeing an increase the people who wants to go for cars . <\s>
<s> Alll these reasons Can increase the number of cars in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But there a downside to this . <\s>
<s> We all know that torun these cars we need fuel and the natural fuel resources are getting depleted day by day . <\s>
<s> The world oil organization has already warned that the current resouurces are not going to last long . <\s>
<s> Taking this call few nations have already taken actions in this direction . <\s>
<s> Like looking for other alternative like bicycles which do not require any fuel . <\s>
<s> Some nations have enforced a law that one day in a week a car should not be used . <\s>
<s> Already the usage of cars is so high that the people are stuck up in traffic jams for hours which is really frustrating . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The oil prices are rising day by day and the common man is not in a position to pay more and so these days people are looking for other options like pooling in with your friends or neighbours who can pick and drop you Thus sharing the load on your pocket . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Considering all these situation i guess that the number of cars should decrease in the future and thus lets make the world a healthier place to live . <\s>
<s> Now-day the market is becoming more and more competitive compared to the past years . <\s>
<s> This change of situation is due to a more sophisticated technology and a better awerness of the products . <\s>
<s> From my opinion this contest leads to a point in which the company , in order to sell more products , produces advertisements that make product seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe that this technic is becoming a strategy used by the companies to attract the consumer 's attention . <\s>
<s> In fact , once the consumer finds out that the product is not as it was pictured in the advertisement , if he has come a long way to buy the product , he will most likely purchaise it . <\s>
<s> However , it may even happen that he is so disappointed that he will not buy at all and at the same time he will make a bad advertisement both on the item and on the company . <\s>
<s> I have experienced this situation as well , in deed , on a magazine I found an advetisement of a new brand that was promoting a shirt , but when I went to the shop to buy it I found out that it did not corrispond to the picture of the magazine . <\s>
<s> In fact , it looked much better on the advertisement and the material was really bad . <\s>
<s> At this point I decided that it would have been a wast of money buying it and I left the shop . <\s>
<s> Moreover , this situation is occuring too frequently and it will influence the consumer in a negative way when buying products advertised . <\s>
<s> In addition this type of promotion make break the trusty relationship established between customers and companies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I can say that i tottaly agree with the statement , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , and I feel that this new approch adopted by companies will have a negative impact on the market and may damage the relationship between producers and customers . <\s>
<s> Before starting this argument , I would like to define the term `` Successful '' as a achievement of what he/she wants to do . '' <\s>
<s> . <\s>
<s> Based on the definition determined above , I would agree with the statement due to the two reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , people who try new things basically know what he/she really wants to do and have a strong will to achieve it . <\s>
<s> Generally , for most people , finding what he/she wants to do is very difficult and people who are doing what they already know how to do well tend to have a hard time with this process or stop thinking about it . <\s>
<s> For example , I have been working as an auditor for more than 5 years and I know what I am doing well . <\s>
<s> Although , the salary increases and I work more easily because of the experiences recently , I doubt if I am doing what I really want to do and to achieve . <\s>
<s> The people who are trying new things have already gotton over this question to themselves and is in at next stage . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , people how are doing new things are taking risks at the same time . <\s>
<s> For example , as I mentioned in prior paragraph , I have been an auditor for 5 years and am working as a manger now . <\s>
<s> If I decided to leave my firm and to start new career in different company , I might have to start my career as a staff again . <\s>
<s> Taking this kind or riks is very difficult for most people . <\s>
<s> I respect their brave <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , based on the reasons mentioned above , I strongly agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Some people believe that it is more important for students understanding ideas and concepts than learn facts . <\s>
<s> However , I strongly disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts thatn it is for them to learn facts for the following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Learnig facts is faster ways to learn for students . <\s>
<s> For exaple , when I was a sixteen years old , I had a first part time job , which was joying an assembly line in a beer factory . <\s>
<s> I expected to the job was going to easy and simple since I learned that the concepts of assembly lines and undersood how the assembly line worked . <\s>
<s> However , the job is not easy and simple at all . <\s>
<s> I had to focus on another people and think what should I do next . <\s>
<s> I made a lot of mistakes and warned from the boss . <\s>
<s> Even though , I understood how it worked and the concept , I did not what was going to be facts , I did make the same or simillar mistakes . <\s>
<s> However , one I knew the consequences I said myself I was not going to make same mistakes again . <\s>
<s> And I could learn to handle the job very fast . <\s>
<s> Therefore , learning facts is a faster way to learn than understanding and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Peole usually remember what they learn from facts . <\s>
<s> When I was a six years old , I entered to an elementaly school in Japan . <\s>
<s> First day of school , I was not used to attending a school : therefore , I missbehaved such as not pay attentions in class and talking with friends . <\s>
<s> Even though , my parents told me I have to behave in class room . <\s>
<s> I had not know what was going happen next , so I wasnot well bihave . <\s>
<s> Teachers punished and warned me and I finally realized facts of missbihave in classrooms . <\s>
<s> Even now , I still remember and I do not think I am not going to forget since facts are really rememberble for me . <\s>
<s> Theexpirience above shows that learnig facts are easy to remember and stay longer than understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Students are be able to remember ideas and concept because once they understood . <\s>
<s> But they can forget easily since they just understood in their brains . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , I totally agree with the statement that it is more important for students to learn facts than for them to undestand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . <\s>
<s> I would agree to the statement aforesaid although i donot doubt the fact that the older ones have already had their piece of cake in terms of enjoyment since they have had their own lovely moments when they were in their adoloscence , when they were youngsters or can be said when they were parents . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now gettin back to the point of my favouring the notion here stated , the youngsters have every thing at this particular span of time that they are in be it health , looks or entusiasm to do variuos things , the quest to hunt for the unknown mysteries of life that surround them and lay unfolded in front of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Coming to the first point , health of the youngsters is perfect enough to keep them raring to do things and to experiment which sadly is not the case with the aged people since with age the human body cells begine to retard and there are enormous problems to be mentioned that keeps age old people to be active . <\s>
<s> For instance , my grand father is 80 years old and i along with my parents had to go on a hill station to celebrate the New Year 's Eve and i really wanted my grand father to accompany me and sadly he couldnot because of a respiratory problem he would suffer being at a high altitude . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Talking of enthusiasm i would say that with no denials to it youngsters have gallons of it stuffed in their nerves . <\s>
<s> Another perspective that i would present is that not only age old people instead people who are only a few years older are less likely to enjoy themselves since the maturity level keeps on increasing with time and what i imply by this statement is that even a five year old would enjoy more than a 20 year old person since because the five year old would enjoy to the fullest only by a mear endevour of meeting a friend whereas the same thing is not likely to attract a 20 year old . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Summing it up wiht the notion `` The older you are the wiser you get and less likely you are to be happy with small thing '' . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , a lot of businesses are growing and developing . <\s>
<s> As far as business is concerned , people who have started a new business want to succeed . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , the people who want to earn a lot of money have to try new things because of following reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , if one has a new idea , it would provide people interested . <\s>
<s> The most important thing of success in business or earning a lot of money begins with people 's interests . <\s>
<s> People do not interest what they already know . <\s>
<s> In contrast , upon seeing a new thing , they interest about the thing and buy it . <\s>
<s> Thus , an interesting idea or new thing which are never known to people could succeed one 's business <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second and last , the world is changing rapidly and variety . <\s>
<s> One who knows how to do well and does the same thing , he/she is never going to be succeeded because the world is moving fast and requires new thing everyday . <\s>
<s> For example , one of the camera company ` Canon ' has changed new way on digital camera . <\s>
<s> The cameras of Canon has ` CMOS ' censor which is the heart of camera and in the past , ` CMOS ' is the worst and cheapest chip . <\s>
<s> Canon , however , has developed this censor new way that is totally different way than before . <\s>
<s> ` Nikon ' , one of the rival company of Canon , was tha best of camera in the film area . <\s>
<s> In contrast , Nikon uses ` CCD ' which is sharper than CMOS but expensive . <\s>
<s> The censor has given from ` Sony ' , hence , it is expensive and it is not their own technology . <\s>
<s> Through Canon 's new trying and developing its new censor become the best camera in the digital camera . <\s>
<s> In the past , film is the only method of taking picture , however , the world photography market has changed by digital and Canon tried a new technology and finally succeed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the world needs new things and people need new things as well . <\s>
<s> Therefore , if one wants to succeed , I would suggest two things . <\s>
<s> Be a creative to make a new idea and try a new way to succeed . <\s>
<s> the product of coars need to be advetise . <\s>
<s> the genuinety of the product is one of the nost important things that a prudoct may have . <\s>
<s> the pubblicity is a soul of tradind and obviously made a product better that in realy is . <\s>
<s> if we take for example about a shoes , in nike spots we can easy see the people that run faster than thi wind , or jump higher than the sky , but in really this concepts are unbeliveble . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All of us kwon that nike shoes is like an other common shoes , but the advertisement make products much better yhan they really are . <\s>
<s> an other example are sky , the satellite tv company , that in the advertise show that yuo can take home the famous movies , in really sky offer the same things that an other tv company offer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> pubblicity aim is only to encurage the people to buy this product instead the other one . <\s>
<s> an other example will be the advertisement of a car , the pubblicity tell that one car is `` like no one '' , but it is icredible , all of the car hav e got 4 wheels , an engine ... <\s>
<s> it 's incredible that cars are so differet to justify `` one like no one '' !!! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion advertisements make product much better than they really are ; so i like this advetisements but i kown that the truth is not what i see , i think that other people on the earth are enjoy with me , but i also know that the largest population of the world may not enjoy with me , is for they that the advertisements is referd to . <\s>
<s> With the invention of information and communication technologies , the people have witnessed great transformations regarding all aspects of our lives . <\s>
<s> They bring many things to our lives via televison , radio or computers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisement has been always an important notion of that new era in the last decades . <\s>
<s> Because , industrialization supported with technology will bring also many and more diverse products to our lives . <\s>
<s> So , advertisement can be accepted as the best way to meet the products to people . <\s>
<s> You can reach to people by using the screens , radios or even internet . <\s>
<s> It is a great way to tell everything to people . <\s>
<s> But , if you use it wrongly , it may cause also great problems for them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What is the aim of an advertisement is an important question to answer . <\s>
<s> It is very simple to say that if I like something on TV advertisement , for example a health soap , i will definitely give the decision to buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But , the advertisement do not tell the everything about the product ? <\s>
<s> Normally , people believe in the words of the advertisement . <\s>
<s> After that , they decide to but the product . <\s>
<s> But , if the owner of the product decides to give less or wrong information about it , in order to make the people to buy more , this may cause unfortunate events . <\s>
<s> I may have possible allergies to some ingredients of the soap that i did not get from the advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do not want believe in that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . <\s>
<s> Even , I 'm not aggree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Although , there will be always bad examples , I know that people will say always the truth to others . <\s>
<s> In japan , students have to learn a lot of words in many kinds of classes since they are children untill they are graduated from universities . <\s>
<s> They , even high school students , a learn more fact than idea and concepts and they tend to have variety of knoledge . <\s>
<s> However , they hardly learn how to think and organaize their idea or concept . <\s>
<s> I do agree the opinion that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , learning idea and concept develop student ' skill of thinking . <\s>
<s> For instance , In mathmatics class , they learn how to solve the question and that make them consider not just indivisual answer but how to solve all same king of question because each mathmatical question is different but there is not each answer . <\s>
<s> Student do not learn fact in the class , but the way of thinking is very important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondally , when students understand ideas or concept of the story , it is fan to learn . <\s>
<s> When I read newspaper or magazine about politics or economics , I do not want to know just the fact . <\s>
<s> But once I understand why the crime happen and what the criminal think , or what the new president ' manufesto and what kind of people support him and why , I tend to reserch more and more . <\s>
<s> If student know only fact , it is harder than extent their interest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , learning concept and idea is able to apply student ' daily life . <\s>
<s> When they are in trouble they have to think the solution . <\s>
<s> Fact does not tell them crue . <\s>
<s> For example , if they lost the way in forein country , they should not just wait with standing untill someone would help them . <\s>
<s> they have to think what they should do themselves , even if they are little children . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than fact . <\s>
<s> moreover , they should express their idea and presentate in front of others . <\s>
<s> Japanese are not good at presentation maybe because there are almost no chance to express their idea in front of audience when they are students . <\s>
<s> Facts are , of cource , important because they can give us interest also ; however , for student , they need to understand idea and concept to practice thinkin by themselves . <\s>
<s> Advertisement is the art of convincing people and making them to beleive in the story told . <\s>
<s> Generally these stories are about products `` great '' specifications , so I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Mostly in advertisements small tricks are utilized to attract the consumers attention to the desired field . <\s>
<s> For example , the information about a campaign ( which can be considered as a product in an advirtisers aspect ) is written in very small puntos compared to the puntos of the slogan and many people do not even see them untill they buy the product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , advertisers mostly exeggarate the products good points . <\s>
<s> Esspecially , in electronic devices one can observe this fact . <\s>
<s> After buying an electronic device it usually does not satisfies the consumers high expectations since it is not as good as it is written ( or announced ) . <\s>
<s> Generally type of slogans saying '' Never such a resolution before '' or '' Great sound quality , better than any other product in the market '' make people to expect incredible efficiencies that would never be true . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , precautions taken to prevent this kind of tricks which lead people wrong proves the existence of such a manipulation . <\s>
<s> It can easily be observed that after this precautions , such as laws , taken advertisements became to the point and they started to give up such tricks , as mentioned above , like invisible informations and superior specifications . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , advertisers are doing their job which is convincing people ( or manipulating people ) altough the precautions taken and they will find other ways to deceive people . <\s>
<s> As it is stated above it is their creativity and the markets request from them . <\s>
<s> More precautions should be taken . <\s>
<s> There are some out there who think that the Facts are more important than the ideas or different concepts . <\s>
<s> Others think in completly opposite manner . <\s>
<s> As far as i concered the i have always been follower of the true fact that is practical stuff . <\s>
<s> I have some example to support my statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the importance of facts should be understood in more broader manner , the ideas and concepts are derived by facts . <\s>
<s> So if one cannot understand the fact , it would be diffcult to understand the ideas and concepts behind certain fact . <\s>
<s> I have one astonishing example of Einstin . <\s>
<s> I have read in the magazine ( Reader 's Digest ) that he always understood the concept and ideas by experiencing facts . <\s>
<s> The Theory of Gravity is perfect example of the , fact coming first and then the concept and ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , the facts represents the overall idea behind it . <\s>
<s> So why not learn facts first then the ideas ? <\s>
<s> In fact , if you consider or hold very much importance of the fact , you are bound to understand the concepts behind it . <\s>
<s> Most of scientists derive their thoery by understanding the certain facts in most perfect manner . <\s>
<s> So i think it is really important to foucs of te learing different facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , student should focus of the pratical knowledge , which holds tremeadous importance in really life . <\s>
<s> I , myself , is perfect example , being a civil engineer , the fact behind every condition holds a important . <\s>
<s> In some condition , we obivously require the understanding for concept . <\s>
<s> But most of the time the learning fact is key . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end , the point i like to conclude is the students as far as possible should foucus learing and understanding the critical facts of any subject . <\s>
<s> It is always wise to have knowledge about a particular subject rather than knowing everything about every subject . <\s>
<s> We all are humans and have only a limited capacity to grasp things though there are exceptions . <\s>
<s> We can focus clearly and effectively on one particular topic at one time . <\s>
<s> Focusing is very important for a better result and that can only be possible if we exactly know what we are going to do next . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are lot of people in this whole world who are effectively doing research on a particular topic of their interest and therefore are expected to give productive out comes because they are very much focused . <\s>
<s> They have enough time and energy to concentrate on a particular aspect of a research also it is a very old saying that little knowledge is a dangerous thing and as we know that our brain has only some limited capacity so we cannot afford to have profoud knowledge of each and every subject and therefore this will only result in frustration . <\s>
<s> Also incomplete knowledge can proved to be dangerous and misguiding also . <\s>
<s> For example if a chemistry student tries to teach physics then he surely be less effective in explaining every point because he has only limited knowledge of the subject , this will be harmful for the students he is addresing and this is quite possible that something wrong can be construed from his teachings . <\s>
<s> Similarly a chemist cannot perform a physics experiment or vice versa and this can result in even accidents Moreover if we assume that every person know everything about every subject then this will result in decrease in interaction among people and advancements in any field will be halted because we know more the number of brains working together , more better is the outcome of the result So in my view it is always beneficial to go more deep in a particular subject rather than having a superficial knowledge of all subjects because in that way an individual can benefit the society in a more effective manner and this is also neccesory por the satisfection of the individual that he is master of atleast something . <\s>
<s> Yes , I agree to the statement that is given above . <\s>
<s> There are many reasons and examples , I would like to cite in support of my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In everyones life , ideas and concepts are very important to learn the subject . <\s>
<s> Concepts help them to understand and know the subject how it is developed . <\s>
<s> Ideas help them to get logical reasoning on the subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , In consideration of my life , Firstly `` I will give importance to undersatnd ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts '' . <\s>
<s> The reasons are concepts are key role and important to get the sunject well and good , Without concept there is no subject , if we know the concept of the subject we can go any where to its advanced levels . <\s>
<s> In this way concept play key to the subject . <\s>
<s> Secondly `` Ideas also helps in understanding the subject . <\s>
<s> Ingeneral , the subject is basically depends on the ideas . <\s>
<s> The person is well recognised on the subject based on his thinking ability , logical reasoning , and creativity . <\s>
<s> Ideas and creativity helps the people to reach advanced levels on the subject . <\s>
<s> Not only on the subject , if we concentrate on concepts and ideas on any thing we can reach the acme stage on that specific thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But in some cases , for example `` To develop or to get advanced level or to add accessories of any product in the market it is compulsory to learn some facts about that previous product '' . <\s>
<s> It is secondary preference only , it is better to know because `` We can attain the best on the product '' . <\s>
<s> The reasons are `` We can know the demand , publicity , value of the product in the market '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , to reach success in ones lives understanding ideas and concepts are very important . <\s>
<s> Therefore , everyone should concentrate on those topics . <\s>
<s> However , beyond concepts and ideas it is also important to learn facts as i had given example . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Insum , I would like to reiterate my opinion that the statement is agreeable from the above reasons and examples . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that mentioned above . <\s>
<s> For example a bussiness man should attempt new markets or develop new strategies in addition to their rational states . <\s>
<s> Because envirement always changes with it 's advantages and threats . <\s>
<s> So If a bussines man wants to survive and gain more benefits than the others has to differ hisself with their risks . <\s>
<s> Everybody knows investing is a critical case . <\s>
<s> If you really do not know the rules or other parameters in the market that you attempt to exist , you will lose your money . <\s>
<s> It is clear that it contains risks because you are a new character in the market . <\s>
<s> You could be beaten by your competitors . <\s>
<s> The information and skills is a key point to accomplish the new situations risks and threat . <\s>
<s> You shoul have skills and information , lack of information could sink you . <\s>
<s> But if you have information , and qualify enough with the state of brave you could benefit and defend yourself from the threats of the market or somoething else . <\s>
<s> Surely seeing the future is an ability but you can estimate the future conditions with the today 's informations and trends . <\s>
<s> You can be the best at what you are doing at , but if you do not improve yourself to an advanced level , you will see somebody has already done . <\s>
<s> And has already benefiting that you could be did if you had not been a lazy one . <\s>
<s> A Sweedish king said ` I would be at a position of winnig with the help of the lossings that i had ' . <\s>
<s> This life i think not for the people who does not improve himself or has a lack of brave emotion , There will be always risks but we all have to try to accopmlish , and let to lead ourselves to advanced levels . <\s>
<s> I dissagree with the statement that `` there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' . <\s>
<s> Now in present generation the need of a car is more essential for each and every individual . <\s>
<s> The car has become an essential body to transportation . <\s>
<s> so the increasing demand among the public will lead to manifacturing the number off cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> AS the population grows we need more cars , for transportation . <\s>
<s> Because the public transportation in the country has failed , people need more cars for transportation , safely and in aproper time . <\s>
<s> we can also go in cars where ever we like to go , what ever time to reach . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , my father uses a car to go to hospital . <\s>
<s> So as my mother uses to go to office . <\s>
<s> so for different reasons we use cars , if there is need for the car how can the number off cars could decrease in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars now adays are used by many people to save the time , to go to job and the other places . <\s>
<s> Cars are use full togo along with the family to a picknic . <\s>
<s> Cars are the main public transportation in the united states , as the public transportation has failed to transport the public . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore the number of cars are not going to decrease in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> They are going to become the double the number off cars present today on the roads . <\s>
<s> so the government has to regulate new laws to regulate the pollution that the cars are going ti produse . <\s>
<s> With the time , advertisements have been popular because they sale products in the market . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I agree that they make products seem much better than they really are by improving their appeareance and convicing the people who buy them that they can be useful , knowing that the reality could be another . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisements improve the appeareance of the product by making it attractive to custumer 's eyes . <\s>
<s> Then , some products like shampoo or soap seem to be good eventhough they are not , but publicists have the ability to trick the customer with some white hoax such as showing people who have wonderful hair and skin in television and meke them lie us by telling us that the product really worked in them improving their life quality . <\s>
<s> As a result , we decide to buy it and just try it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To convice the custumer is a goog way to enhance the product popularity because this is like a chain , in which the information can be spread easily . <\s>
<s> therefore , to anunce that a product have many advantages than others such as heathy food , which is a popular subjet now , can convice people to buy and really spread the information to their family and friends , so finaly everybody belive in it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the mayority of advertisement have been maken to attract customers attention by enhancing the product appearance and finally convincing everybody that they are useful , so the possibility to sale it in the market is always greater because people always belive . <\s>
<s> Perhaps , we enjoy advertisements and we like the world plently of lies . <\s>
<s> Our civilisation is based on consumption and economy so more and more industries resort to advertisement to sell their products . <\s>
<s> Advertisements are everywhere so that we ca n't avoid them , that 's why innevitably we are influenced by them , the question is in a good or a bad way ? <\s>
<s> The aim of an advertisement is make you buy its product by making you dream , by showing you things amasing . <\s>
<s> When you see an advertisement for perfume with a gorgeous woman taking a bath in gold water , you immediatly imagine that when you will put this perfume on your nek you will feel like her you will change of life and that men will run after you ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And the day you will be shopping you will come accros this perfume and it will remind you of the good feeling you had when you saw the advertisent , so you wont resist and buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What about the beautiful amburgers you can see on the front of certain food shops ? ! <\s>
<s> They always seem attractive well done with good meet and green vegetables , but when you have it in a plate , what a deception .. <\s>
<s> you could not even recognise the one you have choosen from another ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The strategy used to convince poeple can change , it depends of the target wich advertisements have to persude . <\s>
<s> But all the way , they have to lie to us . <\s>
<s> Indeed do you really think that the new washing powder will transform your grey laundry to wonderful wite one in two minutes , or that the new diet product will allow you to lose five kilograms in three days without making you sick ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of Course advertisements make products seem much better than they are otherwise nobody would like to by them . <\s>
<s> And the proof is that when you are proposed an offer like a banck wich would send you money there is always a very very little text on the buttom of the advertisement which mentions all the conditions you must feel to be able to have the money ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would like to give an exemple of a prod <\s>
<s> Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is interesting in order to get a general view on subjects . <\s>
<s> One is then able to get involved in different matters . <\s>
<s> The more general view you will have have , the more you will be able to understand other people isssues and what they are concerned of . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But by having a view on many subject , you will not be able to masterise them . <\s>
<s> Specializing in one specific subject will allow you to emphasis the subject and develop high quality skills . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It then depends what you research . <\s>
<s> If you know exactly what you want to be doing or that you work on high technicity subjects you will then need to get specialised . <\s>
<s> If you want to keep an evolution possibility in the subjects you are studying or if you absolutly need a global view on your topic you will then need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From my point of view , it is necessary to develop a high level of skills . <\s>
<s> It is to say specialise even if you have to choose between subjects that seem all interesting and challenging . <\s>
<s> Studying geography , maths , physics , litterature or history will require a high level of knowledge and investment that will not allow you to get on several subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ideally , on a five year academic course , a possible option would be to perform a double study class . <\s>
<s> At the end you will then be specialized in two complementary subjects such as science and management , geography and economics , business and information technology . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , young people can enjoy life more than older people because of three main reasons which are health , willingness for living faster and more enjoyable and having less responsibilities for in life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , it is a biological fact that as the human becomes older his/her health problem increases directly . <\s>
<s> As a result of this fact older people have many and different kinds of health problem and these problems prevent people to live in a comfortable way . <\s>
<s> For example , if a person is a lung cancer , he/she can not enjoy the life because there is a big problem in his/her health . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , young people genarally do not have health problems so that they can do whatever they want . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , young people have the willingness for living faster and more enjoyable because they have independent and new ideas about life . <\s>
<s> For instance , they may want to go to Himalaya mountain for camping and there is nothing to prevent them for going . <\s>
<s> However old people do not want such a hard thing because they usually have no energy for that activity and want to stay at home . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , young people have less responsibilities in life . <\s>
<s> In other words they are living more independent from other people . <\s>
<s> They do not have children or wife to look after or usually their only job is school and they can make lots of plans after school for holidays . <\s>
<s> These situations make young people more free and they have many different and creative plans for life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , for living more enjoyable and different life , being a young person has a great importance because young people genarally have no health problems , they have a willing to live faster and more enjoyable than old people and they have less responsibilities in life and for their environment . <\s>
<s> There are several good reasons why I believe that is better for students to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> First of all , I think that nowadays , work problems are very difficult to resolve and involve a lot of skills like computers knowledge or to know a different language . <\s>
<s> Currently , companies need people to overcome this sort of integrated problems , and the person has to have a broad knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , if students have more skills or abilities , they will have more likelihood to find a job . <\s>
<s> Therefore , if they become borried in their work , they can apply to others job because people with a broader knowledge can do more things than the others . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although it is true that some people say that companies pay more to people who know how to resolve a specific task , I think that is better for a person earn less money but with a lot of likelihood to get a job , than a person who can earn a lot of money , but working in a only one type of job . <\s>
<s> World market today are very difficult , people are hired currently and consecuently they have to look for a job more than ever , for this reason I believe that is better for a person to has a broad knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I can support my opinion with a personal experience that I lived five years ago . <\s>
<s> I was working in CNN as a journalist , and suddenly I heard that the Company Board needed someone to work in trade area . <\s>
<s> After a brief hiring process , I got the position only because I had studied a finance course in university . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I think that have a broad knowledge of many academics subjects is better than specialize in one specific one , because a person have more posibilities to get a job , to resolve better the work problems and thirdly , because encourage his knoledge . <\s>
<s> In the current society , more and more advertisements come out , and it really makes our life that arounded by all the modern products becomes much better . <\s>
<s> Though sometimes it still not so satisfied by everyone , however , we have to say that most advertisements makes products much better than they really are , First , we can easy tell the products that always becom much better that 's because of the advertisement . <\s>
<s> After a product made out first , it must have some drawback and unsatisfaction . <\s>
<s> for instanse , when a new car was made , it maybe have some problems on it 's detail or safety design . <\s>
<s> After garthering many oppions from the users , the manufactor will input more and more technology inside the new modle and it will give us more and more comfortable , easy control and safety driving . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> second , comes wit the new products that are made , we can find that we have more enjoy in it . <\s>
<s> For example , when the mp3 was fist out , it 's just have a fuction to us is to hearing some music . <\s>
<s> It did n't think about too much about it 's outlooking or the others . <\s>
<s> But when the time goes by , the more advertisement to it makes more and more fuction on it . <\s>
<s> Like the newest ipot have the function of veiwing pictures , lessoning the music and even can be used as a cell phone . <\s>
<s> At the same time , it becomes more beautiful with all kind of colors that can satisfied different teaste . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , most advertisement makes our life become better . <\s>
<s> It full of everywhere of our life and every products . <\s>
<s> So we can feel the products around us make our life becomes more convience and more comfortable . <\s>
<s> Though maybe there are some unsecessful exanmples of advertisements happened in the past , but when time goes by , it changes too and disppeared from our life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of all , <\s>
<s> Successful People who is doing Things <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Do you know what is the best way to be successful when you doing things ? <\s>
<s> My friend always tell me about doings new things such as in his house or his work or anything . <\s>
<s> He likes to descover and he wants to make things differently . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I think make or do the things you know it already for make sure you will finish it and gain the time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , people want to finish the things what they have . <\s>
<s> for example , If your boss gave you research , you should finish it , so you would work for paper with information that gave it to you or from work , so you will finish it because it would be easy for you to do it ; however , you would know the routin to do it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secound , people wikk gain the time . <\s>
<s> For example , Like what I said above you know the routin , so you will finish it early or on time , but if you want to make new things maybe you will not finish it on time , so your boss will be angry . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people think you must do new things because you have to for make new different kinds to be the best and to be evolve . <\s>
<s> However , it might be true , but maybe you spend a lot of time I mean `` Wast the time '' because if you did n't make it you will lost the things that you work on it . <\s>
<s> for example , you will do newspaper . <\s>
<s> If you did n't make it on time ( New form ) , you will be late to show the custmers and you will lose the custmers also . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , The people who do the things what the know it already is better because make people sure to finish it and to gain the time . <\s>
<s> I hope for people who want to make new things , they think and think more and more before do it if they will make it or no . <\s>
<s> students now all over the world are receving thier information in a more diffrent way . <\s>
<s> I think it 's impotant and also fundimental for students to undrestand ideas and concepts rather than simply to understand the facts of any subject . <\s>
<s> for knowing just the facts of the subjects it 's not all what it seems ; However students learn the proper way that is the understanding of the idea and conept of the subject or the matter . <\s>
<s> for examples to learn history , the student must focus on the facts ; Despite that the student must also learn the true ideas and concepts for it deep meanings and imageanation of it matter . <\s>
<s> Inaddition about history and it 's time students ; However knowing the time that the war or conflict had occured or dated , students should know the main idea and concept and of that particular war or conflict had occured students should ask this question , first of all way did it happen ? <\s>
<s> Also what is the reson for this particular war and confict to happen ? <\s>
<s> What would prevent the war or conflict from happening ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And finaly what were the out come of the war or conflict ? <\s>
<s> Therefor students should consider to think of the resons and the idea of the subje <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerd , I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> We always say all kinds of advertisements in the TV shows . <\s>
<s> They all show the products have really good taste or effect like so on . <\s>
<s> but , actually , the products are not so wonderful . <\s>
<s> First , the madecines which are loss weight do not bright the same effect as the TV shows say . <\s>
<s> Second , the advertisements are try to get more attention from the people . <\s>
<s> Last , the adverisments is always on TV . <\s>
<s> it must give the positive image for people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For the first point , today so many people have the weight problem , because of we may be profer to eat high fat food like chocolate and cake . <\s>
<s> In that case , we consider to worry about our body . <\s>
<s> So many madecines have produce to let us loss weight . <\s>
<s> When we open the TV , it always shows pictures that one extremly person take its medcine after some times , he losses 40 or 50 pounds . <\s>
<s> But when we follows the steps which just the advertisement says , sometime we can not get the same effects like it shows to us . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the company of the productions wants to get more attentions from the society . <\s>
<s> In order to get mor profits . <\s>
<s> Advertisements are the good chioce to show their new productions to people . <\s>
<s> Because of this reason , the avertisements must shows what is the advatage after the people who have choose their productions . <\s>
<s> So it must be as much better as it is really . <\s>
<s> sometime advertisement give lager advatage to get more people to buy the productions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last one , advertisements musts shows on TV , So they most show the positive image to people . <\s>
<s> if the advertisements always show the bad things which from the productions , no body will like to see and also the advertisements will cancel . <\s>
<s> Advertisements will not get the advatage to the company . <\s>
<s> Even worse , they bright some troubles to the company . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In sum up , i think the advertisments make productions much better . <\s>
<s> Enjoying the life is more dependent on the factors like age , culture , workatmosphere and many more . <\s>
<s> If one counts all the above factors it 's more obvious that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A young person will be having the zeal to develope himself among the competitive world , here a person undergoes lots of pressure and stress may due to the work or due to the climate they work under . <\s>
<s> So most of the people tries new ways to relief themselve 's from stress and strain so they outmost try to opt entertainment such as movies , parties and every possible way to get relief from the day to day work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people enjoy not only with the people of their age group , or of the same culture , but they mingle with each and everyone , they find out new ways for entertainment . <\s>
<s> They tend to locate different places and attend parties . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand old people tend to a similiar age group , they enjoy sitting with together and participate in religious function 's . <\s>
<s> They donot feel that much stress or strain as the young people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As youngster 's would be more energetic than the old people thay do have lot of aspect 's for entertainment and fun , they have their unique way to celebrate , share their ideas and cultures which most of the old people would'nt prefer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Mostly old people constrain themselves to a limited part , It does n't mean that they wont have fun and they do n't enjoy . <\s>
<s> They will have their own way of life and their own prespective of living . <\s>
<s> They constraint themselves to the religious function 's , or else with the small get-to-gether with the family member 's . <\s>
<s> Most of the old peole prefer pleasent and stress life after their dutie 's , they prefer clam and pleasent atmosphere arround them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my point of view the statement given can be stated as the contradiction of the past and the present life of a man , since every old person is a youngster once a time before in the past . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion i want to agree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy the life more than old people do '' . <\s>
<s> Since it 's not the comprasion of past and present but it 's a comparision between two races such as old and new faces of a person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would end this by concluding that `` Young people enjoy more than the old people do '' . <\s>
<s> I prefer to travel in agroup led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> As you know , evrybody can enjyoy a trip evrywhere in this global society , so there are many choices for their own . <\s>
<s> Especially , Its deponds on people what kinds of the style they like it . <\s>
<s> I want to show why I choice the opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firsty , It is very convinient if we had a guide . <\s>
<s> We do n't need to plan ourselves where we go . <\s>
<s> It sometimes make us stressful and kill a time . <\s>
<s> The guide know where we want to go and can explain about it perfectly . <\s>
<s> We can enjoy the trip without worrying . <\s>
<s> The last time I travel in Korea by myself made me so nervous . <\s>
<s> I could n't speak and read their language , so communication is so important . <\s>
<s> If I had had a guide , the travel would have changed well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , If we are a group led by a tour guide , we can exchange information of the travel . <\s>
<s> The travel will meke up a lot of wonderful excitement . <\s>
<s> It will be happy if we could share the impression with a group . <\s>
<s> Inaddition this , the guide can show best possition to look at the building if we want to go to the a favorite sites . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Following the reasons , I agree with the opinion that The best way to travel os on a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Travel sould enjoy with many people . <\s>
<s> from my experience , I want to go many travel and talk to friends sharing the memory . <\s>
<s> That strory lead me another trip . <\s>
<s> All peaple in this world injoy their life in the way they can and the way they want . <\s>
<s> Children can enjoy their life buy playing games and alot of childrens activities . <\s>
<s> Old people can enjoy their life by doing sports and having a walk with some friend also they enjoy their time by sitting in a parck and read a book . <\s>
<s> young peaple injoy their life by hanging out with friends , studing in libraries , clubing and alot of other extra things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people are the most people who can enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> Becoase they have the most intersting things to do . <\s>
<s> They can think of new inteserting things to do . <\s>
<s> They are also the first thing that make the city busy and crowded . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cheldren also have many things to do . <\s>
<s> They starts to learn new things and practice it with their friends in their houses . <\s>
<s> They go to Desenyland and have so much fun They also think of some new interesting things to do . <\s>
<s> Cheldren like their school , they waste most of theis day time studying and having fun at school . <\s>
<s> Alot of childrens are fun they make their perents and grand perents have a nice time with them so old people enjoy their time with their grandchildrens . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Old people can always enjoy their life in the way they can . <\s>
<s> They like to go out and see whats happening in the new world . <\s>
<s> They always smile and show their respect for people they also like joging and doing sports activities . <\s>
<s> Old people always waste their lite by reading books . <\s>
<s> And they always enjoy their life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion i my self disagree that young people enjoy life more that older people . <\s>
<s> Becoase life is not only for young people it 's for all and there is always many t \ interesting things to do in life for any age . <\s>
<s> Life is nice for everyone . <\s>
<s> Recently , I had a chance to have brief meeting with Tom who just came back from the Europe trip and I was able to hear abou the valuable stories and funny episodes . <\s>
<s> However , he strongly mentioned about the lessons given by the trip and also eagerly tries to advise me that without a tour guide tourists are capable of making a trip more interesting and memorizable . <\s>
<s> Convinced by Tom , I do not agree with the statement that `` The best way to travle is in a group led by a tour guide '' due to two main reasons . <\s>
<s> First of all , by depending on the tour guide , tourists dangerously lose their resposibilities and also deeply become dependent . <\s>
<s> For example , let us say there are two babies who have been raised differently . <\s>
<s> The first baby , Jimmy has been gifted with a couple who belive that babies must be raised with great care ; on the other hand , the Jeffrey has been raised by believers who desire their babies to bocome less dependable . <\s>
<s> Most likely , Jimmy raised with great care will be excessibly so dependent that when he reaches to the time to work in a company , he will have many problems based on the disability to solve problems independently . <\s>
<s> However , Jeffrey will be really strong and does give up in society even though adversities try to block him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , without the tour guide , the tourists tend to more colaborate each other in a group and naturally make their trip more voluable and memorizable . <\s>
<s> LIke I mentioned in the previous paragraph , being independent is really important element for people in society , but also knowing how to work with coworkers is significant . <\s>
<s> According to Tom , he said that he had a lot of hard times to find places he and others in the group want to visit . <\s>
<s> And he added that because poeple more tend to be collaborative and agreeable , they could have very successful and inerasable trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , by depending on a tour guide , it will be little valuable trip in the reaons of the high cost for it . <\s>
<s> So , if some wants to have wonderful , memorizable trip , he or she have to avoid a tour guide who probably takes his or her independence . <\s>
<s> Some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way . <\s>
<s> But , a group tour normally has its strict schedule and does not offer the tourists in group any chance to meet many people in new place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , a group tour has its own strict schedule and all the tour team members should follow it . <\s>
<s> And it means that I can not choose the place where I want go and the food which I want to eat . <\s>
<s> For example , when I went to Thailand for the first time , I chose a group tour because I was young and it was the first time to go abroad . <\s>
<s> I really wanted to go many attractive shops and spots in the street in Bangkok , but I could n't go there because I was in a group tour and I had to follow the schedule which the tour company offered . <\s>
<s> And I had to wake up early in the morning and had to go back to hotel in early evening , even though I wanted to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morning and wanted to go outside in the night . <\s>
<s> It was really bad experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , a group tour does not offer many opportunities to meet other people for its tour team members . <\s>
<s> Becuase a group tour moves together by its tour bus , it is difficult to meet many people in new places . <\s>
<s> But if I travel alone , I can meet many people and feel their cultures . <\s>
<s> When I went to Tokyo by myself , I met really many people there . <\s>
<s> I could talk with them and some of them became my friends ! <\s>
<s> Even though I could not go a lot of sightseeing spots as efficiently as a group tour , choosing a place where I go and going there by a subway were really exciting experience and Japanese people were kind to let me know the ways . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All things considered , I definitely belive that a group tour led by a tour guide is not interesting or exciting at all . <\s>
<s> By going new place alone , we can learn more about the new place and feel much about the people there . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , because if they want to be more successful than they already were , they would try to expand their skills and learn more new things and try to become successful in that , too . <\s>
<s> They would risk their time and money , and probably even their profession , in order to gain that knowledge and master that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Once a person gets good at something , he or she either tries to get even better at that skill , or they keep it at a level they are content with . <\s>
<s> To successful people , that is not enough . <\s>
<s> I have a friend who is a wonderful harpist , and she practices her harp at least 9 hours a day . <\s>
<s> She is a harpist for 3 professional college orchestra/groups and plays in concerts practically every week . <\s>
<s> But even with all her talent , she always says it 's not enough . <\s>
<s> Now , she 's learning how to play other insterments , like flute , clarinet , and cornet , and is expanding her musical skills to a new level . <\s>
<s> She is almost like a professional harpist , yet she pushes herself harder and harder by practicing for hours and learning how to play new musical insterments . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In order to learn new things , people must get educated . <\s>
<s> In order to get educated , they either have to find a professional who majors in that particular field or go to a school/college . <\s>
<s> Most successful people have jobs and probably even a fammily , so if they want to learn something new , they would have to cut their time short with either one of them , maybe even both . <\s>
<s> That causes new risks , like losing their job because they do n't work as much anymore , or lose their family because they do n't spend time with their family anymore and his or her husband/wife is tired of their ignorance . <\s>
<s> But if they think their education is worth the risk , then they should go right ahead and keep on going . <\s>
<s> You do n't have to be successful in order to learn new things . <\s>
<s> No one has the right to stop anybody from gaining knowledge for their satisfaction . <\s>
<s> when one weigh the pros and cons of using a car , it will lead to an inevitable conclusion : in twenty years car will become a kind of ` endangered species ' in our modern society . <\s>
<s> Currently , this question is raising a huge controversy because , on the one hand , car is widely used as a traditional means of transportation and cars are also a part of our cultur [ especially , in the US , where car drivers are totally enamored with their cars ] . <\s>
<s> But on the other hand , the increasingly price of petroleum and fossil fuels , the environmental issues linked to the widespred use of cars and other drawbacks make people think more deeply about cars . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact , I maintain that cars are going to disappear in a very close future , mainly because of economic reasons and environmental issue . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First and foremost , people are more and more concerned about the sharp growth of their expenses . <\s>
<s> Using a car involves a lot of shortcoming since it is very expensive to purchase a car , to buy oil and to ensure your car , for instance . <\s>
<s> So it seems that cars tend to become less available for the middle class families in developped countries . <\s>
<s> Besides , one should bear in mind that it is not so comfortable to use a car because you have to endure traffic jams , which may end in traffic accidents sometimes , you have to commute every day and I strongly believe that people are fed up with such problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , cars will be fewer used in the next years because people are well aware that it is damaging to the environmemt and the nature around them . <\s>
<s> Obviously , one should not expect modern human to renounce technological progress or to return to the Stone Age . <\s>
<s> But , if things are left as they are , the human specie will finaly disappear . <\s>
<s> Thus , I am sure that one should prefere rescue our planet and lives of next generation rather than keeping his car . <\s>
<s> That is all the more crucial that the situation is obviously getting worse , so i cannot help thinking that men are able to make sacrificies if it is worth it . <\s>
<s> Similary , we can see the harmfull impact of cars in our daily life . <\s>
<s> In big cities there a lot of exhaust fumes , a lot of noise , smog and pollution and , to my mind citizens will not stand it any longer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , the developpement of alternative ways of transportation will also lead to a fewer use of cars . <\s>
<s> For instance , a mayor in a big town can decide to increse the public transportation network , to make it more convenient and available in order to replace cars . <\s>
<s> That is what happened in Paris recently . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , eventhough a lot of people are still addicted to their cars , they will soon change their mind . <\s>
<s> Economic reasonning and ecological issue are couple of reasons which let us thinking that there will be fewer cars in use in your city . <\s>
<s> There is no doubt that it will enhance our quality life for both generations , present generation and future generation . <\s>
<s> What is the best way to travel ? <\s>
<s> Although some people prefer to travel by themselves without any tour guide , I particular prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide because it offers various advantages such visting famous places , making new friends and save time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , traveling in a group led by a tour guide takes people to famous places . <\s>
<s> For example , if I go to Paris in this way , I will visit the most important places in the city . <\s>
<s> I might know the best of Paris . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if I go by myself , I need to use a map and learn about the tourist places . <\s>
<s> In this way , I might miss important places . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , traveling in group by a tour guide gives the chance to make friends . <\s>
<s> This type of trips are usually in groups of 20 or 30 people . <\s>
<s> If I go with this group , I meet people of different countries and cultures . <\s>
<s> I can also meet people of different ages . <\s>
<s> Then I can keep in contact with them after the trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , going on a trip in group led by a tour guide help people to save time . <\s>
<s> People will go straight to main places without getting lost . <\s>
<s> Consequently , people will not waste time trying to get to a place because they will be guide by an expert of the area . <\s>
<s> For example , if want to visit the best places in Boston , I can just trust and follow the tour guide because he knows very well the places and the area better than me . <\s>
<s> In this way , I can plan to visit the most interesting places in Boston in a short time because someone will guide me . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , I think that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide due to the benefits it gives me . <\s>
<s> These are the opportunity to visit the best places in a town , city , or country , the chance to make new friends and the advantage of save time . <\s>
<s> In this way , people can have more fun on a trip . <\s>
<s> I think that I will have to partially agree and partially disagree with the statement that young people tend to not give enough time helping their communities . <\s>
<s> To answer the question accuratley though , and to fully explain my personal opinion on the topic , first of all we need to define the word ` community ' . <\s>
<s> A community is not only the place where you are living . <\s>
<s> It might just as well be a certain group of people you spend a lot of time with , like your sports team , your school , political parties , your church or a local band . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All these are communities . <\s>
<s> Sure there are young people who just like to hang out with their friends at home , watching television or playing videogames . <\s>
<s> But teenagers are starting to wake up again , they have begun to be more active and participate in group activities , in communities . <\s>
<s> There are festivals and street markets organized by teenagers , they sing in their churches or help raising funds for charity projects . <\s>
<s> It is the young people - and not big companies or mighty politicians - who are struggling for a job and a future and therefore go through a lot of effort like organizing conferences or meetings with those in charge to change something about the situation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Clearly they cannot do all this on their own and need help from adults like parents , teachers , mayors and company bosses . <\s>
<s> But young people are up on their feet again , they are trying to make a change for the better . <\s>
<s> Of course it is very easy to get the impression that in our society everyone only thinks of his - or herself anymore and is not willing to volunteer for a higher purpose , especially when you think of teenagers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , this impression can only be right if you look at individuals . <\s>
<s> Many young people are only concerned with their own future and their own well-being , excatly like many adults do . <\s>
<s> But there are just as many great teenagers I know that spend a lot of time helping their communities and the people surrounding them . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , it is more imnportant for a person to have as much extensive knowledge of a variety of academic subjects as he or she can because of two good reasons . <\s>
<s> Firstly , it could be considered to him and others as his bachkground knowledge and experience of life . <\s>
<s> Secondly , some knowledge of everything is preferable that one might someday be in need of the use of that type of knowledge , and employ it in his or her own life . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , being epecialized in only one subject and forget about knowing a little from and a little from therer might make someone ignorant when he or she is exposed to situationms where he or she is required to make a response to a general knowledge stimulus . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One 's life is not limited only to books and what he or she is specialized in . <\s>
<s> In my society , when people gather at a party or any similar occasion , they do not just sit there . <\s>
<s> They talk about any topic that might interest their lives or thinking . <\s>
<s> For example , during my brother 's wedding last week , people has discussed the impact of terreorist people on tourism in the Middle East . <\s>
<s> I was personally astonished to know from common people that the number of visiting France is double the number that visits the Middle East every year . <\s>
<s> What puzzled me more , is the source of the information . <\s>
<s> Another important issue here is that we should not limit our knowledge to books because what is ion book is mostly hypothetical , and what we need in our life is some kind of knowledge that can be practical and benefitial . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , do we sometimes need to use that general knowledge we have ? <\s>
<s> The answer to thgis question might lie when any of us face a problem and think of a solution . <\s>
<s> Provided our knowledge is limited , we may not be able to find a solution to that problem ; If the problem requires some knowledge of physical laws , or some chemical background . <\s>
<s> We do not need to be specialized in one field and when we have a small problm ask for help . <\s>
<s> thus , our general knowledge of different subjects definitely helps us to avoid every day trouble or have suggested soultions to problems that need a specialist . <\s>
<s> I do not agree with the statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Facts are points of information which are a hundred percent right , cannot be denied and can be proven right an infinite amount of times . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The law 's of gravity are examples of factual information . <\s>
<s> This information can never be proved wrong therefore it is important for a student to learn this rather than information that could be wrong . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Concepts and ideas also have a huge amount of importance regarding the education of a student however it is not as inporntant as factual information . <\s>
<s> this ideas are only someones theories and thoughts , they have n't been proved right yet . <\s>
<s> When theories or ideas are proven to be right they become facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When comparing these two types of information one must look at their origin . <\s>
<s> If a fact is a theory or idea that has been proven to be right the inportance of this information is therefore greater than the inportance of the ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students need to learn about laws or facts in order to really know how to approach and especific research . <\s>
<s> Theories are very often rejected and replaced by others , this constant rejection of theories is why theories lose inportance throughout time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There was a time when the earth was believed to be flat , this was a theory . <\s>
<s> When technology gave men the power to actually investigate this theory the idea was rejected and therefore replaced by a fact , that the earth is round . <\s>
<s> Correct knowledge is what actually matters in a student 's education . <\s>
<s> If the information learned was wrong then there is no purpose on learning that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts still play a huge factor because in order to investigate something there must be a theory and someone willing to prove it wrong . <\s>
<s> I no one figured that the earth was flat it is likely that none would have tried to actually find out . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore the inportance of each kind of information can vary and often depends on the students beliefs and goals . <\s>
<s> If the student is more interested in scientific reserch then both kinds of informantion must be equally evaluated . <\s>
<s> But if the students is in to less scientific or objective activities like art and music concepts and ideas play a bigger role . <\s>
<s> The Art of Advertising <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertising is one of the most influencial techniques in people minds , human has invent a weapon to control the market . <\s>
<s> Many major industries expend millions of dollars in advertisment , because advertisment is what really pop up their sales . <\s>
<s> Products may be good , but advertisers try to make them look better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of advertisments only shows the qualities of products , but deffinetly they dont show the bad face of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We are totally surrounded by advertisements , there are everywhere . <\s>
<s> The cities are full of them . <\s>
<s> Almoust all products in market are advertise in differnt places . <\s>
<s> Our minds are fully influenced by them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my point of view , I agree with the statement , most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> To support this idea a perfect example is credit card comercials : If we see a credit card comercial on TV , tit might show us an incredible vacation in the Himalayas or a beautifull yatch in the middle of the caribbean , so the first we imagine is us on that situation , then the next think we do is apply for a credit card , deffinetly we will be the next person in the Himalayas or the caribbean , and that 's not true The true is that we might have the credit card , but we cant affort the trip , we need to work harder to get the money to pay the trip , if we dont have the money to pay , we wont be able to go , and the credit card wont be as usefull as it looks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example might be the food advertising , non of the foods you get , are as good as big or as tasty as the ones they show on the advertisments . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also must advertisers are proffesionals , and they know how to manipulate producs and make the look the way people want them to look , but when people buy the products , they are totally different from what they saw in the advertisement expect . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For me , advertisement industry is valid , people can make efforts triying to show the best characteristics of a product , but what is not valid for me , is that advertisers manipulate them to show advantages that the dont have . <\s>
<s> The most important fact that helps human beings survive under very dangerous situations is their ability to deceive . <\s>
<s> Many countries , companies have survived disadvantageous situations exploiting this talent . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , advertising a product is the same thing as deceiving people and tricking them into using the product . <\s>
<s> Thus , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Regarding the amount of profit that a company can make from a well-advertised product , nobody should expect the hints of honesty in advertisements . <\s>
<s> This essay will explain some of the reasons that support this opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , the main politics of every company is with no doubt to hold the greatest fraction of shares of sell of any product . <\s>
<s> Considering the number of companies that produce the same product with almost the same quality , it is obviously seen that the only way to be able to achieve this is by advertisement . <\s>
<s> The competition in the area of manufacturing the highest quality product usually does not have a distinct winner . <\s>
<s> Thus , the companies have to carry the competition to another area , the field of advertisement . <\s>
<s> The avarice and ambition to win this race , sooner or later , leads to dishonesty in the advertisements of products . <\s>
<s> In other words , the mass of people who are the possible customers of the product that is being advertised are deceived by the misrepresentation of the characteristics of that product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , it is a known fact that people tend to buy things that are visually more attractive . <\s>
<s> Think of how all the cars in the commercials are so clean and shiny and always are driven in highways that go through valleys or roads with big leafy trees on each side . <\s>
<s> These are all tactics used to trick people into buying the product and are more easily formed due to the developing technology . <\s>
<s> We all have seen people flying when they wear shoes of a certain trademark or cars leaving flares behind when they use gas from a certain station . <\s>
<s> By making the product seem as having extraordinary properties , the potential customers are deceived . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , it is a very important part of business life to be able to sell the achievements that you make . <\s>
<s> It is the only way to get high rank places at work and for that you may have to misrepresent some information in public . <\s>
<s> This is exactly what most of the commercials do these days , make products seem better than they really are to increase attraction to it . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with this sentence . <\s>
<s> Attracting a new client is the base of advertising and in a wider meaning of marketing techniques . <\s>
<s> I graduated in Marketing two years ago and the first thing I have been taught during my lessons is that , as a future manager , I would have had to sell the idea of a product not the product itself . <\s>
<s> This statement , that might sound quite absurd at first sight , has turned out to be very useful in my job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main reason to support this concept is that a customer , when gets in touch with a product , does not act in a rational way . <\s>
<s> Many researches based on customers purchases have clearly demonstrated that the customer was n't sure of his choice after a few steps he had made out of the shop . <\s>
<s> This example clarifies how it 's not important what a person thinks about a product after she has bought it . <\s>
<s> The producer must focus his attention on what a customer wants to find in the product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If a person in charge of a marketing department of a company fails to do this , he 'd hardly be able to sell the product . <\s>
<s> Moreover , as the range of possible items is constantly increasing , advertisements help the customer to do his/her first choice . <\s>
<s> If a product shows many possible upsides from its use and multiple possible utilisations it will attract a person for sure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The more you exagerate in showing an item , the more you will catch the attention on it . <\s>
<s> Of course , this does n't always works becouse you will always find a segmented target aware of the fact that you are probably hiding something . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , I would say that advertising is an art . <\s>
<s> Something you cannot learn . <\s>
<s> Something innate through which you lead people to buy everything you want , but ... <\s>
<s> Something that can improve a product only in the fantasy of a consumer not in reality . <\s>
<s> in my opinion i disagree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. '' the reasons for why i do not support that statement are written below . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> firstly , when a person does a job for a long time and repeats the activities of his or her work over and over again , they become specialized in the work that they execute on a daily bases and this suggests that the person doing the job is best suited for it and that also means that that person does not have to worry about being unemployed any time soon whearas when a person decides to take on a task that he or she knows nothing about , this means that they are unsure of what they are good at and that they live their lives by the moment which is not a smart decision for anyone . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> also when a person is firmiliar with their work , new ways on how to preform a task are developed and this saves time for the person doing the job , and also increases productivity which in turn increases profits the buisness makes , but if a person keeps on jumping from job to job and not getting himself firmiliar with any one job , this will most probably end in a buisness losing profits because the work was not done by a professional . <\s>
<s> so many people in the world today take risks in the jobs they do but it is a known fact that only a few of them ever prevail and achieve their dreams . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> so finally , i would like to end this essay by saying that eventhough taking risks can sometimes turn out good for a person we should not think that we will be lucky enough to have such goos fortune and instead we should work on the things we know best inorder to succeed in this life . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the idea that understandig ideas and concepts is more important than learing facts . <\s>
<s> It is more important to learn , even if you do n't know exactly what something means , because if you can learn how to apply what you 've learned in real life , then you wo n't forget about it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the main objectives of a student is to learn , or at least it should . <\s>
<s> There are several factors that could change the goals of a student , or even the results of what they 've learned . <\s>
<s> In order to learn , you can use real-life examples to understand a concept in a better way , and that 's an easy way to learn . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When your teacher uses easy examples in the class , sometimes you do n't even realize thay you 're learning until you remember that particular example in the real world . <\s>
<s> And I think that 's the best way to learn , because you might not even try to learn and you do it anyway . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my personal experience , I love teachers who explain something to me in a simple way . <\s>
<s> One of them is by giving examples you might know , or some experiences you might had . <\s>
<s> And the best of all is that , one day without any effort , you remember what your teacher tought to you , and the example he/she gave you . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is very important that teachers try their best to make students consider that is more important to learn the facts instead of memorizing a concept . <\s>
<s> Because if you do that , maybe you will know the definition during the class , during the week , or during the course . <\s>
<s> But if you never use that concept again , or if you do n't even care about knowing how to apply what you 're learning in your real life , then it would be like if you did n't learn a thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is really important to be aware of this important aspect in learning , and it 's a homework we all have to accomplish : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> - Students in order to be better prepared , and <\s>
<s> - Teachers in order to improve students ' learning . <\s>
<s> As a student , we learn a lot of different types of knowledge from teachers , classmates and textbooks , including ideas and facts . <\s>
<s> The essences of fact and idea are different , and the skills to learn fact and idea are also different . <\s>
<s> Some think that learning fact is the most essential thing ; others argue that understanding ideas is more important in learning . <\s>
<s> There have been an agruement for a long time . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , I agree that to understand idea and concept is more important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My first reason is that understanding concept is the basis when we study , but memorizing facts will limit students ' thinking . <\s>
<s> Once we understand the concept of the question , it will be mush easier to solve the problem by using the concept and idea . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if students only focus on the text and memorize the fact which is found by others , they lose the chance to think about the question on their own . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that understanding concept and idea will help students to extend their own ideas . <\s>
<s> Knowing the concept is the basis for innovation . <\s>
<s> For example , although many inventors do not accept regular education , they practise and extend their own idea and imagination just based on the concept . <\s>
<s> Most of the inventions are from the concept of materials and the inventor 's creativity . <\s>
<s> In other words , without just learning the fact from books , understanding concept give students more space to imaginate and try . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Tos ummarize , I think understanding the idea ans concept is more important than learning fact . <\s>
<s> To learn fact is to learn something dead , however , concept and idea are alive . <\s>
<s> Knowing concept ecourages students to think deeply and creatively . <\s>
<s> A lot of people want to be successful , and they try to succeed in different ways . <\s>
<s> Some people prefer to take risks and try new things , while others prefer to succeed by doing things that they master . <\s>
<s> I always succeed because I do things that I do well . <\s>
<s> I do n't like to feel the uncertainty of doing something new , I do n't like to make mistakes , and I do n't like to waste my money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Primarily , when I do something new , I do not know what is going to be the result . <\s>
<s> I feel better when I have the certainty of the things , and I always succeed . <\s>
<s> I need to turn unknown things into known things because I will have more probability to do better things in my life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I have been successful all my life because I always try to master the performance of many activities in my daily life . <\s>
<s> Secondarily , doing new things inplies many mistakes because people have to try many times in order to improve their performance . <\s>
<s> When people make mistakes often , they can lose credibility with other people . <\s>
<s> If other people are observing me , I try to perform better my activities . <\s>
<s> Finally , trying new things offers the invovenience of spending a lot of money . <\s>
<s> Each effort has a high cost because the possibility of failure is great when I do new things . <\s>
<s> Experiencing with new trhings requires either new material and equipment or more people . <\s>
<s> All these resources are very expensive . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I prefer to save money and do things that I do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people do things in a different manner . <\s>
<s> While some of them try to do somethiong new , others do thigs that they do well . <\s>
<s> I do not like to take risks in my life , so I try to do things well all the time . <\s>
<s> Taking riks is insecure , risky , and expensive . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is : is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or is it more imporant for students to learn facts . <\s>
<s> This issue is very important , because the answer to this question could lead to a better learning system . <\s>
<s> In my opionion both the understanding of ideas and concepts and the learning of facts is very important . <\s>
<s> But if I have to chose , I guess understanding ideas and concepts would be more important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason why I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important is because students will forget the learned facts , but the understanding structures and concepts keep in their minds . <\s>
<s> For example , when a student learns why exactly to use this kind of word in sentence in a foreign language , he can everytime remember why he is doing this way . <\s>
<s> But if he just uses this kind of word , someday he will forget it and ca n't remember why he should use this word . <\s>
<s> The student who learned ` why ' using exactly this word , can everytime remember . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An other reason why I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts is because students do n't learn how to solve problematic issues . <\s>
<s> When they only learn facts , they are not able to understand the real problem , because the never learned how different concepts work . <\s>
<s> They just learned what the facts are , but every single issue differs from the exactly learning structure , so they maybe do n't understand the idea . <\s>
<s> But students who learned how to deal with ideas and different concepts , are able to solve the problem better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , in my opinion it is easier to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> That is an important aspect , because many students may be a little bit stupid or are not very intelligent , but they get the same grades than the intelligent ones because of learning facts . <\s>
<s> That is would n't be right , because when a student understands the idea und understands the ` why ' , he is a very good at what he does . <\s>
<s> But the student who just learns the facts , he is n't good at what he does , he just can things good in his mind . <\s>
<s> Should this be the sense of learning ? <\s>
<s> In my opinion , it is n't . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ultimately , I think understanding the concepts and the ideas is very important for a student . <\s>
<s> It is also important to learn facts , because in some subjects you have to learn more facts than in others . <\s>
<s> But my reasons and examples demonstrated that it is the better for students to understand , so they keep things better in their mind , the can solve problems better and the can be proud of their grades ! <\s>
<s> I think that in twenty years there will actually be fewer cars than there are now . <\s>
<s> In this essay , I will explain the reasons why i think this will happen . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main reason for my views is the increasing price of gas . <\s>
<s> We have seen that the petrolium prices have gone through the roof recently . <\s>
<s> In the last three years , they have more than doubled . <\s>
<s> The fuel efficieny of cars has more or less been stagnant in the last couple of decades . <\s>
<s> It is reasonable to assume fuel efficiency will not be able to offset the rising prices . <\s>
<s> At this rate , it will be prohibitively expensive to drive a car , and people will prefer public modes of transport such as buses and metros . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that more and more people are becoming aware of the pollution caused by cars . <\s>
<s> People are increasingly concerned about their environment , and are taking steps to maintain it . <\s>
<s> In Denmark for example , an increasing number of people are using bicycles rather than cars . <\s>
<s> Taking a cue , other Europeans have started adopting these steps . <\s>
<s> This trend is likely to spread well beyond Europe , into America and other continents . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars make people lazy . <\s>
<s> As people become more health conscious , they will stop using cars , and use more healthy ways of transport such as cycling or biking . <\s>
<s> They may also prefer to walk if the distance is short . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With the advances in aviation industry , it is becoming increasingly affordable to travel by air . <\s>
<s> If we can extrapolate this , travel by air may in fact become cheaper than travel by cars in another twenty years . <\s>
<s> In that case people are highly likely to stop using cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it is more likely than not that there will be fewer cars twenty years from now . <\s>
<s> This is supported by present conditions as well as past experience . <\s>
<s> In general I support the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing things they already know . <\s>
<s> To support this statement you first have to look at the reasons why people become successful in the first place . <\s>
<s> You also have to have a look at the word successful and to evaluate its definition . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people - usually we are thinking of people who are successful in more than one aspect of life , e.g. work , family , sports ... <\s>
<s> We consider them to be above average . <\s>
<s> But what do you have to do to become above average ? <\s>
<s> It requires you to go a step further when other people stop , or to use ways and means that nobody has used before you . <\s>
<s> A successful scientist , for example , has to abandon worn out paths and try something new , look in a direction that noone has looked before or exploit a field that has been considered as irrelevant . <\s>
<s> By this he moves himself on a brink , because leaving the standard routes always implies the possibility of failure . <\s>
<s> A manager who has the reputation for being able to fix unsuccessful enterprises had to do the unusual to stand out of the row of managers before him , who all but failed . <\s>
<s> However , to reach true excellency you have to take risks and do something new - otherwise you will remain average . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , if you are already successul you have the monetary or social background that you can risk something without gambling with your bare existence . <\s>
<s> If you hardly have enough money to feed your family you will be less likely to do anything that might harm you in a way that you wo n't be able to support them anymore . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if you have sufficient resources at hand you can afford adventures and failures , as they might onlyu set you back a bit but not deprive you of your way of living . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having said this , it is easy to infer why successful people tend to be riskier or otherwise exceptionnel : They had to have these strains in their character to become successful at all and they have less consequences to fear . <\s>
<s> Their ability to cope with failure and their exploratory sense make them more affected to being truly unusual . <\s>
<s> Personally I agree with the statement that in twenty years there definitely will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> There are quite a few reasons to my opinion . <\s>
<s> The most important ones are : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , the global demand on non-replenishable resources such as petrol and diesel , is ever increasing , Perhaps the overwelhming growth of the world economy , industries , cars , etc has caused such an increase today . <\s>
<s> However in twenty these resources will be sparse or too expensive to buy . <\s>
<s> Thus , without the necessary ingredient - fuel , I think there would be fewer cars than today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , phenominal advances in technology and communication will defintely give way to other sources of transportation . <\s>
<s> Perhaps air travel , fast and efficient metros ( trains ) and other more efficient and cost effective ways of public transportation may be the norm twenty years from now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , the increase in cars and other means of road transportation is a major cause of air and noise pollution today . <\s>
<s> This is not only causing serious environmental damage but is the cause of damage to the whole ecology - be it flora , fauna , animals , humans , etc . <\s>
<s> Such mis-endeavors are causing the governing bodies of the world to wake up and take notice . <\s>
<s> I suppose stringent regional and global laws will either prevent people from buying cars or at the least will restrict them from buying a single car twenty years from now . <\s>
<s> Thus unlike today when perhaps a single person owns multiple cars , such a thing will perhaps not be possible in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A lot of people may not agree with my opinion . <\s>
<s> Perhaps because today none of the above seems possible i.e. more cars per person , no laws , etc . <\s>
<s> However if we all take a pragmatic view and think logically I suppose all of us will come to the same conclusion that there will be fewer cars twenty years from now . <\s>
<s> For writing a comment on a statement it is essential that we provide a description of the actual situation first . <\s>
<s> At this time the automotive industry is one of the biggest industries in the world , combining a great number of globally leading companies like Toyota , Daimler-Chrysler and BMW . <\s>
<s> The sales figures for cars are still rising , especially in emerging markets like China and India and the forecasts until the next decade do not suggest a shift in this trend . <\s>
<s> This extreme market growth is the problem for the several problems we are facing today . <\s>
<s> Cars are one of the main reasons for the air pollution in cities and metropolitan areas , infrastructure projects for cars destroy enormous amounts of nature environment and because the car is a vehicle for the individual transport of people , it is not able to deal with the more rapidly increasing world population . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Newest trends in the sector try to establish alternative fuel technologies like hybrid technology or fuel cells to decrease the amount of emissions a car produces and to give the customer a chance to be independent from high gas prices . <\s>
<s> In the U.S. the Toyota Prius is selling excellent and this has got one main reason : The people do not want to use public transportation and favor individual transport methods . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This reason is the basement of my personal opinion , that there will not be a significant decrease in the number of used cars in twenty years . <\s>
<s> No government would accept a development where the very costly infrastructure for cars gets useless . <\s>
<s> Modern and fast public transportation systems are rare and mostly to be find on railways ( ICE , TGV , etc. ) , but the accident of the Transrapid recently showed that the technology of these new rail-transportation methods is unsafe and not capable of being introduced widely in the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Instead the car will evolve in a way , which will make it suitable for the conditions it will face in the near future . <\s>
<s> The electronic assistents within the car will be 100 percent responsible for the driving and the car will be navigated on the motorways by satellites . <\s>
<s> This electronic guided traffic will allow to reduce the spaces between the different cars , providing higher average speed and making it so possible to use the infrastructure at the most efficient way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So there will not be a significant change in the number of cars within the next twenty years , but the car as a transportation vehicle will definetly redefine itself in the near future . <\s>
<s> Considering the fast development of our society , people are now eagering to gain more and more knowledge of many diferrent academic areas to survive in the more and more intense competetion in different conditions such as going to college or being in a beneficial position in the job market . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A strong argument for these phenomenance is that we could promote our interpersonal ability by learning a lot of different accademic subjects . <\s>
<s> By doing so , you are able to know the conditions in many areas so as to master the task of your work in the whole and make right decision . <\s>
<s> It leads you to success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Further more , possessing a broad knowledge in different areas could make you cultivate new interest in different fiels and give you more perspectives to look at your surrounding world . <\s>
<s> It brings you a great body of fun and makes your life meaningful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I also have a personal reason for learning a lot of knowledge . <\s>
<s> I am a man with a strong desire for achievement and always want to possess more knowledge about the world which would challenge myslfe and make me a useful people needed by my society. a wide knoledge in lots of aspects enable me to seek success in more areas rather that a narrow one . <\s>
<s> I can combine them together to make me more wiser so that I could directly contribute to the society . <\s>
<s> As to me , feel needed is my final happiness of my life and a broad knowledge make me realize it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Meanwhile , to specialize in one specific subject also has its merits . <\s>
<s> You could concerntrat on one fiel you like and have a high academic achievement . <\s>
<s> However , you may be not able to jump from your small `` circle '' without a wide knoledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Due to what has been talked above , it is more safer to say that : broading your knowledge makes you more sccessful than you would if you do n't . <\s>
<s> I do agree on this following statement . <\s>
<s> We all know it can be very hard to succeed in our work , in our plans of life , in our career . <\s>
<s> It demands a lot of work and an entire contribution . <\s>
<s> This is the price to pay to become successful . <\s>
<s> The sensation of having succeeded something is really unique and it makes us feel we have accomplished something we have always wanted to happen . <\s>
<s> Life is too short and all of us should have many goals in life . <\s>
<s> Once an goal is reached , we can profite from it as much as we want but why not continue ??? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Take the example of a baker . <\s>
<s> He manages to open his first bakery in town after many months or years of working on this very difficult project . <\s>
<s> Finally the bakery is a real success , but he thinks one is enough work to do . <\s>
<s> I think he should continue and expand his business by opening one in another town nearby . <\s>
<s> Of course he has the risk of failing but imagine the fantastic sensation of victory if his second bakery is as much as successful as the first one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Wanting to be successful does n't concern only our work and career plans , it can also be in our family lives . <\s>
<s> Successful people are right to try new things so they wo n't have any regret on what they did . <\s>
<s> Life is too short to live without any risk . <\s>
<s> But concerning the fact of taking risks to be successful , we have to be very careful on what it implies . <\s>
<s> Some people are too ambitious and it can have very negative effects . <\s>
<s> There is no need to put our family or ourselves in danger only because we want to achieve something new . <\s>
<s> We have to think in a very realistic way before doing anything , but what a feeling if we succeed in all our accomplishments ! <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> This issue is important because it discusses the mentality of successful people and what they did to earn their success . <\s>
<s> I agree that successful people try new things rather than doing what they already know because that is the basic theme of sucess . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to me succes many a times means to be just different-a class apart . <\s>
<s> Many scientists would have not succeded if they would have not thought differently than others . <\s>
<s> Many businessmen would have not succeded had they adopted the same production and marketing policies . <\s>
<s> Because of the above mentioned point I think successful people do new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly doing new things also helps different other people who were not helped before , making the initiator succesful . <\s>
<s> For example , Mahatma Gandhi tried a new thing called satyagraha and and non-voilence and helped Indians to come out of the clucthes of the British regime . <\s>
<s> He became successful because he tried a new practice in the history of indian independeence instead of watching in silence , a thing which an ordinary person would have done . <\s>
<s> Hence at times helping people in a new way also makes a person successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly a person who takes risks and tries new things gets an immense sense of fulfilment . <\s>
<s> In this way he becomes successful in his own eyes . <\s>
<s> Doing things which already one knows makes him bored and the job monotonous . <\s>
<s> Sometimes one tends to lose interests in everyday routine work , so trying new things or new methods would often make even a lay man successful in his own small way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I would again assert that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> This is because only doing new and better things help them become succesful and different from others . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group lead by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Since traveling is often for leisure and entertainment , traveling in a group with a tourn guide would restrict my individual interests , my pace , and the intimacy of the group dynamic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , traveling is supposed to be enjoyable for the tourists . <\s>
<s> Although a tour guide may be able to lead the group toward the major and well-known attractions , in his or her attempt to appeal to the majority of the tourists , many tourists ' individual interests may be compromised . <\s>
<s> For instance , if the town is internationally famous for its wine but also has a nice but small museum of WWI artifacts , the tour guide is most likely going to focus on wine tasting rather than the historical artifacts . <\s>
<s> However , one of the tourists in the group may be a history buff and is hoping to expand his collection of WWI artifacts , he or she may miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime conforming to group interests . <\s>
<s> Thus , in many such cases , traveling is better done individually or in a small group of friends rather than in a group led by a tourn guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , traveling is a chance to only to see and experiences new things but also to unwind . <\s>
<s> Thus , the pace offered by a tour guide may restrict one 's ability to relax . <\s>
<s> For instance , in a tour group , there may be people of all ages groups . <\s>
<s> Typically , the younger tourists would be more energetic , attempting to see everything and speeding up the group 's pace . <\s>
<s> However , the older people in the group may just be hoping to relax and enjoy the view at few select locations . <\s>
<s> Thus , the disparity between the goals and pace of the tourists in the group may restrict many 's traveling experience and may even be the cause of additional stress . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , much intimacy and freedom is loss when traveling in group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Since tour groups are usually composed of random people across the nation , or even across the world , it may be difficult to feel comfortable in their presence . <\s>
<s> Also , when traveling in such a large and unfamiliar group , freedom of speech and behavior is lost . <\s>
<s> For instance , with adults around , teengers wo n't be able to blast the music they love on the radio and with the children around , the adults wo n't be able to talk about many of the personal details of their life . <\s>
<s> Conversation tend to become more superficial and restricted . <\s>
<s> Hence , in many cases , traveling in such a group led by a tour guide is not the best choice . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> With restricted interest , pace , and freedom , I would not have a good traveling experience and I think many would feel the same way . <\s>
<s> I do not agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> This is because if a person has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and if he does not specialize in any of them then he would be a best example of `` jack of all trades but specialist of none . '' <\s>
<s> This would definetly not prove useful for him and for the society as a whole . <\s>
<s> He will not be in a position to contribute anything , because he does not know any subject in-dept . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If he just has a broad view of many subjects , then in the later stages of his life , that is after his graduation , he would remain in a confused state of mind , and he will not be in a position to settle on one particular field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am saying this confidentally because i faced a similar situation in my own life . <\s>
<s> When i was in my college studying B-tech ( biotechnology ) , i used to give equal importance to all my subjects . <\s>
<s> So after my graduation i was in dilemma , and i was finally confused with my profession . <\s>
<s> I was not able to settle down on one particular subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So i would suggest that it would be better that we choose one particular subject in which we are highly interested , and then put our soul and mind into it , to learn the subject thoroughly and perfectly . <\s>
<s> In this way we will have a greater in-sight into the subject and we will be in a position to contribute something from our side for the betterment of the subject . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with this statement because of several reasons . <\s>
<s> First of all I want to mention an experience . <\s>
<s> In my final classes at school I got a complete different type of teacher in the history course . <\s>
<s> The previous one wanted us to learn dates . <\s>
<s> The new teacher organised his lectures completely different . <\s>
<s> For him it was important that we understood the whole picture , the process of history and the relationship between important events in time instead of learning dates . <\s>
<s> That was very interesting and much easier to learn because everybody understood why the things happened and in which chronology . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From my point of view it is important that the students \ pupils have fun by learning the objectives . <\s>
<s> To understand the idea is in my opinion always more interesting than learning facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The next point in my argumentation is the importance of understanding the idea itself . <\s>
<s> If somebody does not understand the idea behind for example an economic model he cannot explain what he calculated . <\s>
<s> Another example is if somebody did not get the message of marketing and how it functionates , he probably will write a good test because he learned the marketing Ps or something like this , but he will never be able to work as a marketer . <\s>
<s> The reason for this is that he did not understand the concept behind marketing and probably will not remember the 4 Ps , although he had learned them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Here we are at my third point . <\s>
<s> The remembering of something . <\s>
<s> If somebody has understood anything it should be no problem for him to remember this idea after a long period of time . <\s>
<s> It is in his mind . <\s>
<s> He will never forget it because he understood the reason , the porpuse behind the concept . <\s>
<s> For this argument it is also important to look at the circumstances the idea was established . <\s>
<s> By understanding how the idea came upon it is also easier to understand the idea itself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the end I want to say , that I am really thinking that understanding something is more important then learning only the facts , although sometimes it has to be . <\s>
<s> We live in a big and diverse world , and the only way to know it , learn about its different cultures and participate in new experiences is by traveling . <\s>
<s> Travelling needs to be done with enough preparation and interest so the trip results in a pleasant one . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I think that the best way to travel is without a tour guide because it helps you to experiment a different culture , get in contact with the people that live in that place and experiment real relaxation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , I think that travelling without a tour guide and helps you experiment a different culture . <\s>
<s> Tour guides mostly focus on turistic places , places where large crowds of people prowl and it is almost impossible to find a quiet place to observe the beauthiful attractions that place offers . <\s>
<s> So , if travelling consists of hanging with crowds of people I better stay home and go to the stadium . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , when travelling all by yourself you get the chance to get in contact with the local people , an experience that cannot be compared . <\s>
<s> Travelling consists not only watching but experimenting different cultures . <\s>
<s> When you travel you must take the time to learn about local people and it customs . <\s>
<s> Therfore I cant think of a better way of getting aquainted with another culture than by travelling all by yourself , visiting exotic cities and talking to old people that were born and would die in the place you are visiting . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , by travelling without a tour guide you can really relax by doing what you please when you please . <\s>
<s> When you are travelling with more people and led by a tour guide , it is rare the ocassion you can do what you want , you must always keep with the group . <\s>
<s> To all the places you go , there will always be the sound of people joking and laughing making it impossible to relax . <\s>
<s> So , travelling in a group ca n't be called a holiday . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Travelling is a privilege that here in Ecuador few people can afford , but when someone decides to travel , I think he must always do it without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> When traveling on your own you should consider your ability to dont get lost and reach places with a map as your only guide . <\s>
<s> But I strongly recommend people to take the risk because at the end , the experience adquired is unforgettable and it will always compense the hours spent looking for a place that in the map seemed very easy to get . <\s>
<s> I will be discussing the question whether young people do enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> I do think that this question can be answered on a variety of levels and I will try to state my opinion on this topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people have a lot of possibilities in life . <\s>
<s> Most of them have a lot of friends , quite some spare time and a lot of different hobbies and occupations . <\s>
<s> They can always travel to new places , move around with ease and connect to other young people fairly easily . <\s>
<s> Also , our society offers a lot of different ways for young people to enjoy life , they can be with their friends , they can go to the disco or visit concerts and a lot of media such as computer games and current popular music are designed specifically for younger people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For old people however , there are n't as many viable opportunities . <\s>
<s> They tend to have fewer friends and a very different style of enjoying themselves . <\s>
<s> A lot of them have to work quite a lot , not leaving too much time for themselves . <\s>
<s> They are also usually bound to their hometown , it is where their house is , where their work is and where their children might go to school . <\s>
<s> All of that does n't really enhance their flexibility too much . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless , they can still enjoy themselves and they can do so on a different level . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It seems just by comparing what is offered today , that it is much easier to enjoy life when you are young , but that does n't necessarily hold true . <\s>
<s> A lot of young people feel the constant need to go to different places and to always have something going on around them . <\s>
<s> While older people can deeply enjoy a nice glass of wine and a good conversation with a friend , young people often have trouble enjoying anything very deeply . <\s>
<s> Since there is always a lot going on , they also ca n't really appreciate what they have and what they can do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people also have constant worries about their own future , about relationships and about what will happen to them in their life . <\s>
<s> All of these worries do in a way prevent them from truly and deeply enjoying something good that happens to them . <\s>
<s> Older people are often a lot more content with their own life , have accepted their fate and can therefore enjoy their pleasures in life more deeply . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So in conclusion , young people seem to have endless possibilities and seem to enjoy life a lot more on the surface , but since they have a much harder time to really enjoy what they have , I would n't say that older people have less enjoyment in life . <\s>
<s> Of course it always depends on the individual and there are many cases where a such general rule simply does n't apply , but overall I do n't think that the amount of enjoyment can be evenly compared . <\s>
<s> Both sides can enjoy life a lot , but they do it so differently that I feel this statement can neither be agreed to , nor proven to be wrong . <\s>
<s> Teenagers have always been the hope and the backbone of our society . <\s>
<s> Just like the relationship between teachers and students , teenagers bares the burden of achieving greater success than their parents . <\s>
<s> But does this mean that the older generation 's lives are easier and happier than young people ? <\s>
<s> No , I neither agree or disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , we will talk about young people . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , young people are the representation of our fast-changing society . <\s>
<s> To most of them , life is a tideous fact which they cannot escape . <\s>
<s> Faced with large amounts of academic studies in school , family pressure such as not fulfilling their demans to achieve good marks at school , and also family violence and the possibiliy of loosing a father or mother from a early divorce . <\s>
<s> Young people today are also threatened with the corruption of our society . <\s>
<s> Our media influences our young minds with movies , music , news and advertisements . <\s>
<s> And what do young people learn from them ? <\s>
<s> Violence , sex , dishonest , and many more unvirtous things . <\s>
<s> A great example would be the increasing number of young gang members in our sociey . <\s>
<s> Many of them were born and raised just like any other children , but the moment they turn on the 50 Cent rap songs , they are addicted . <\s>
<s> Addicted not only by the beat of the music , but also corrupted by its contents . <\s>
<s> Many of them began to immitate certain celebraties they adore without realizing whether the things they learn from these so-called `` artists '' are teaching them . <\s>
<s> Some of them might even start walking the road towards crime . <\s>
<s> So can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do ? <\s>
<s> I do n't think so . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the older generation face new problems too . <\s>
<s> Today , we live in a world with little or no morale contiousness . <\s>
<s> In countires such as China , the old Confucianism which binded the traditional way of life is disappearing . <\s>
<s> Children do not respect the elders no more , they can argue with rudeness , they can have sex before they get married , they can smoke in school , they can dress themselves like whores and criminals . <\s>
<s> Although our governments have fundings for the old people when they retire , but that 's not what old people really want . <\s>
<s> Most old people have experienced wealth , fame and love , they do not need elegant houses and expensive cars . <\s>
<s> They just need a good physical and mental health . <\s>
<s> And despite the little amount of money for any old person to live other than the medical fees , what they need is love , love and caring from their kids . <\s>
<s> Statistics have shown that a lot of old people die of lonelyness and frustration other than physical illnesses . <\s>
<s> All that said , do older people live better lives than young people ? <\s>
<s> I think neither . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , I conclude that neither young or old people have enjoy life more . <\s>
<s> The young troubled with pressures within themselves , they are faced with social and family pressures . <\s>
<s> The old are left alone and isolated from the rest of the society as if they are useless . <\s>
<s> To improve the situation , I think the only solution is instead of wealth and fame , people should pay more attention to morale principles . <\s>
<s> In this society succes plays a very important role . <\s>
<s> The definition of success is to be good at something and make money with that trade , or talent . <\s>
<s> Some people have it easy and some people have to work a little harder for it . <\s>
<s> It is very important to be familiar with the subject of interest , however it is also important to try new things in different areas and take risks . <\s>
<s> A person can not truly know their potential , if they only stick with the trade they learned . <\s>
<s> If their potential of growth in that field has deminished and they are not successful they will never be successful . <\s>
<s> It is impossible for a person to be successful if they do not try anything new and drastic . <\s>
<s> It will always keep them in the same routine , and even in the same financial situation they are in today . <\s>
<s> A drastic change is needed in order to be successful because creativity can only come from change . <\s>
<s> It could be real estate , or even a bussiness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is definately a good thing to take a certain amount of risks because if nobody would take any risks our economy would not be same today . <\s>
<s> The founders of various fast food places , coffee places , and grocery stores took risks to open their stores . <\s>
<s> Imagine the world without Starbucks , Mc Donalds , and Wal Mart for example . <\s>
<s> These are internationaly traded corporations , and very successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Trying new things like the idea of a drive through restaurant , for example , and taking risks in not knowing if it would be a success in the future , play a very important role in being successful . <\s>
<s> I <\s>
<s> Environment protection has been a big political matter during the last decades . <\s>
<s> There were times when laws were enforced to reduce pollution such as the waste from cars . <\s>
<s> But the Kyoto protocol , which a lot of counties all over the world signed and agreed to , is not taken so much care of anymore . <\s>
<s> All the same , people are starting to realize about the necessity for pollution reduction . <\s>
<s> This has to do with the signs of our nature that we encounter nowadays . <\s>
<s> Glaciars are melting , the climate is getting warmer , the ozone in the atmosphere is shrinking , the forests are dying . <\s>
<s> Everyone knows that it is proved , that all of that has to do with how we treat the environment . <\s>
<s> So the connection to the number of cars is obvious . <\s>
<s> Since cars produce a lot of pollution , they need to be reduced in number . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not just the awareness of the people will help though . <\s>
<s> Cars are expensive , so the finacial aspect of having a car could be an important matter too in 20 years . <\s>
<s> From what I know , a lot of towns in Switzerland are thinking about charging the carkeepers to drive into the town in order to prevent traffic jams . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , the parking spaces are gonna get more expensive since the space is limited . <\s>
<s> This is not going to change in the future at all since the population in a lot of countries is increasing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another aspect is the improvement of the public transport systems . <\s>
<s> In Switzerland , there is a fantastic system . <\s>
<s> Trains and buses are almost never late and there are very few areas that ca n't be reached with public transport . <\s>
<s> I am aware that this is not the same in every country but if people fear that a lot of jobs will be gone if people do n't buy cars anymore , they have to see , that on the other hand , improving the public transport is going to create a lot of work too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think that there will be fewer cars around in 20 years . <\s>
<s> I belive in it , that people will take their responsibility to protect our planet for the next generations to live on . <\s>
<s> In the four-word short maxim , `` no pain no gain , '' contains the tremedous truth which reveals the secret of the successful people in the history . <\s>
<s> The people who brought progress to the world were those who challenged themselves to new things through the painful situation , and not those who followed the typical rule accepted by the world . <\s>
<s> Columbus took the risk of going to the sea in order to discover a new continent , and the Wright brothers , took the risky action of inventing air plane , the best inventory human ever created in the history . <\s>
<s> Trying new things despite high risks and pains are one of the common factors of the successful people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Columbus not only took risk of his own life but the risk of hundereds men when he went on the unprecedented trip to the ocean with his followers . <\s>
<s> People did n't think it possible to discovered the new land , and even those who suspected the existence of continent were n't bold enough to try the risky business . <\s>
<s> Only by trying the new and dangerous business , Columbus was able to succeed in acheiving his goal . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , others who did n't try new things were never able to succeed but only made his success even more special . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The wright brothers , who brought a huge progress to human life for inventing air-plane , also took a great risk when they experimented their air-plane . <\s>
<s> Even after their air plane fell and the incident almost took their lives , the brothers did n't hesitate a moment to try again to successfully invent their air plane . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most people follow the typical rules accepted by the world ; few people go over the typical rules and make a great acheivement . <\s>
<s> Like Columbus and Write brothers , only those who go over the boundary of socially accepted and the risk , are the people who change the world , so called successful people . <\s>
<s> For a comunity it is really imporpant that a lot of people help for free otherwise a community can not exist . <\s>
<s> To clear what I am writing about I will state first different possibilities where young people can help in thier communities and then answer why they do it or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In every community there are churches where young people can help . <\s>
<s> A church contains people of all ages and young people can help seniors in a variety of filed as for example carry home their borrowed things or drive them home . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people can also help thier communities by partizipating in a party and try to change the politics in a new more effective direction . <\s>
<s> If young people can identify themselves neither with a church nor with a political party the can partizipate in social activities in general . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At first I would like to stress that not all young people do not give enough time for activies helping the community . <\s>
<s> On the other hand I am sure that there are too less young people helping thier communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A problem for most young people have is that they have to focus on school or university in order to get a job in the end . <\s>
<s> Many young people do not partizipate in the three possible ways stated above because they do not see consideration . <\s>
<s> They are working for free and giving away a lot of time and in the end most of the time no one pays attention for these performed activities . <\s>
<s> It is a huge compenporay problem that what countes most is the degree from school or university and social activity does not get attention . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I learned it by me own that another graduate pupil got a certificate for good marks without havong done any social activiety in his communities . <\s>
<s> The other pupil who had nearly as good marks as he had did not get a prize for that . <\s>
<s> The society should honour more social activities . <\s>
<s> Even when applying for university the students should have the possibily to show the social activities they have performed in the past . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The circumstances which may led to the situation why too may young people help are that do not know where to go to when they are willing to help . <\s>
<s> Church and political parties do not attract everyone . <\s>
<s> Most of the young people may not just go to a hospital and ask there if they need any help . <\s>
<s> I think the schools and universities should offer more possibilities for young people performing social work like installing a socail day where all students work together for the communitiy . <\s>
<s> The parents should wake up the social side of their childs as early as possibly . <\s>
<s> When the children see that the partents perform social activities for the communities it will engage them to partizipate more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The last possible reason why too less young people help their communities is that the older people think that the young people are not reliable enough for socail activities and do not give the young people the possibiliy to work for their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A change of society wil change the young peoples ' behaviour an will bring us to the best We should start the change . <\s>
<s> Success is usually the result of doing something in a new and sometimes extraordinary way . <\s>
<s> Successful people like Bill Gates , Michael Jackson , or Donald Trump were successful because they did things in a totally new and unconventional way . <\s>
<s> Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard and revolutionized the software and computer world when he invented his well-known Windows software . <\s>
<s> Very successful people tend to do things in an unconventional and new way in order to create value for themselves and society . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> These rather extreme examples of successful people are far above the usual definition of success . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , they demonstrate a certain way of dealing with ideas and visions . <\s>
<s> Successful people have to take risk in order to become successful and make their ideas or dreams come true . <\s>
<s> If a person only does what he or she has done his entire life in the same way over and over again , it is evident that this will not lead to outstanding success and recognition . <\s>
<s> People are successful for doing things in a new way and , therefore , they are rewarded for what they achieve and not only for what they already know . <\s>
<s> Of course , a person 's success is always combined with a lot of risk and luck . <\s>
<s> When Bill Gates left Harvard in order to start his own business , he made a very risky decision . <\s>
<s> What if his computer programmes would have failed ? <\s>
<s> But successful people have to take on financial and personal risks to convince other people , to find investors for financing , and to prepare for long times of hard work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In contrast to that , there are people who like things the way they are and appreciate what they have . <\s>
<s> These people might call themselves successful and happy although people from the outside might disagree . <\s>
<s> Therefore , it kind of depends on your personal opinion whether you call yourself successful or not . <\s>
<s> The extreme examples mentioned above do not happen every day and involve a high amount of risk and a spirit of adventure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I generally agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> But the line between success and failure is very thin and it always depends on your point of view whether someone is successful or not . <\s>
<s> It is said often that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , but I would disagree with that . <\s>
<s> However , before laying out the arguments against this statement , it is essential to define what is meant by `` community '' . <\s>
<s> Is community to be understood as the general society that we live or can it be understood as the specific community of an individual , meaning his or her family and friends , neighbors and people of the town or village that that individual lives in ? <\s>
<s> If `` community '' were to be understood according to the first proposition , than I would still argue against the orginal statement . <\s>
<s> True , traditional ways to serve one 's community have changed over time . <\s>
<s> For example , the church in Germany has lost its importance for a lot of young people ; thus , there are not as many people involved in charitable activities organized by the church as it might have been the case 50 or 40 years ago . <\s>
<s> However , these ( and similar ) chores are now being fulfilled by other societal organizations . <\s>
<s> Non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace who are vital to discussions in and changes of societies depend especially on the participation of young people for they are generally more flexible and able to invest time - and young people do indeed make up a big part of their active members . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If we were to understand `` community '' to be a smaller group of people , than I would absolutley refute the original statement . <\s>
<s> Recent surveys such as the German `` Shell Study '' have shown that young people value family and a safe and comforting community higher than they used to in the 1970s and 1980s . <\s>
<s> Scientists believe that this development has its roots in the effect of globalization : people are required to be more flexible and to adapt to changing conditions while at the same time facing an increasing insecurity due to the job market which sees a high unemployment rate or at least very instable working conditions even among highly qualified young people . <\s>
<s> And since traditional values have increased in young people 's favor , they are naturally more willing to help to sustain the structures that provide them a sense of belonging . <\s>
<s> Thus , for example , they take care of older family members instead of having them live in a retirement home , they help neighbors repair their house , they organize groups at school that cook for the children instead of having them by fast food products , and they are engaged in local politcs or regional environmental initiatives . <\s>
<s> to sum up , all these examples show that young people do care about their communities and and that they are not devoting less time than other younger people in earlier times to help their communities . <\s>
<s> When we look into the present scenario in my country , India , one will find more number of bikes than cars . <\s>
<s> This is the case because people here are not inclined towards the luxurious goods , like car . <\s>
<s> They are more intrested in possessing those goods which are required to live a normal life . <\s>
<s> But as the rate at which the development is taking place in the country , one can expect this to change . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , when we look into the technological growth taking place aroung the world , one will understand that the humans are not satisfied with what they have . <\s>
<s> Each and evry time they come out with a new idea to make human life more simpler . <\s>
<s> This is leading us to an age when a luxurious good in present day will be an daily necessity . <\s>
<s> People are very lasy to work hard to travel from one place to other . <\s>
<s> So they came out with the idea of bikes instead of bicycles . <\s>
<s> Then came the four wheeler car . <\s>
<s> It had all the features of an bike and it also provided comfort . <\s>
<s> But the cost and maintainance of it didnt encourage many to look forward for it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays , we have got the technology which can be used to manufacture cars at a cheaper cost and which can be maintained with no extra care . <\s>
<s> In future , there will be cars which guarantee more comfort , speed , luxury and efficient fuel consumption . <\s>
<s> We can even look forward for models which run with a battry or solar energy , which are renewable sources of energy , than going for petroleum fuels which are on the verge of extinction . <\s>
<s> This will encourage more number of people to buy cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When we look it from an individual point of view , the economic growth of the country is growing at a faster rate . <\s>
<s> People are becoming wealthier and are looking forward for comforts . <\s>
<s> As in India , an normal family has four people and when ever they want to travel as a group they have to consider some outside means . <\s>
<s> But as the present day Indian can afford to buy a car with his earnings , without a second thought he is going for it . <\s>
<s> The present population and the sales of the cars in the country tells the rate at which the the number of cars on the road is increasing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , twenty years down the line , we can look forward for an India , when more half of the Indians possess a car . <\s>
<s> CAR , WHICH IS A LUXURIOUS PROPERTY NOWADAYS WILL BE A DAILY NECESSITY AT THAT TIME . <\s>
<s> In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When were cars invinted ? <\s>
<s> how many cars were produced since that date ? <\s>
<s> what 's the annual growth of cars ' production ? <\s>
<s> This was all i needed to think about to decide if i agree or disagree with the provided statement . <\s>
<s> I of course disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Why do I disagree with the statement ? <\s>
<s> it 's because of my questions that I asked myself earlier when trying to decide if i agree with the statement or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not only because of these questions that i disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Let 's just take a look at the vehicle industry , how many manufactoring companies were in the market just 50 years ago in comparison to the number of companies these days ? <\s>
<s> I used to be able to know what was the brand of a car by just looking at the design , and they were n't that many . <\s>
<s> Now each company has more than 10 models of cars and i 'll not claim that i know all brands out there but here while i 'm writing this essay i can remember 37 brands . <\s>
<s> This would n't be the case if number of cars are expected to drop any time soon , except maybe if we invinted flying cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even if i do n't bring up statistics and work with only perception ; i 've been driving for over 7 years now and i can honestly say that each year it gets worst . <\s>
<s> Traffic is becoming a nightmare , number of bridges and underground stations are trippling each year not even doubling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I live in Cairo , and i believe there will come a time when we will not find a place on ground to have another underground station and i ca n't even imagine where are they going to find space to build more bridges . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Maybe if public transportations were more organized , or if we increase the age group that can be permitted to drive ; say 21 years of age . <\s>
<s> I do n't realy know what can be done to decrease the invasion of cars . <\s>
<s> What i do know is that cars usage is increasing and it 's not decreasing anytime soon . <\s>
<s> WORLD OF ADVERTISMENT <\s>
<s> In the competitive environment of business every company tries to prove that it is better than another . <\s>
<s> One way to give such an impression is `` advertisement '' . <\s>
<s> One aspect of this advertising issue is the conservation of honesty . <\s>
<s> Do the companies prefer their product to be presented in a way better than they really are ? <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , yes they do . <\s>
<s> This concept will be analysed based on the following arguments : true aim of giving advertisements , when to give advertisements , comparison of the product we see and we buy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , it should be clear that , companies ' intention in giving advertisements is to make their products sold . <\s>
<s> That is why they give money to advertisement makers , hoping that after this campaign there will be a dramatic increase in the profit of the company . <\s>
<s> Moreover , some companies prefer to give advertisements before a new product is out for sale . <\s>
<s> Due to the fact that no one has ever seen it , they can manuplate the appearance of the product such that it will look perfectly and be more prone to be bought . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , a company might plan giving advertisements on products which have a lower selling rate recently . <\s>
<s> For instance , if a shampoo is not selling enough , the company agrees with a very well known artist or popstar for showing up in an ad and saying `` I am also using this shampoo , if you want to have as beautiful hair as mine you should also use this . '' <\s>
<s> Actually , most people are aware that she is not using that shampoo . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , they have a tendency and temptation to buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , apart from the fake suggestions and manuplations done on the picture with the computer , what is shown in the advertisements is the first appearance of the product , not what we buy from the market . <\s>
<s> There are several steps during transportation and storage where the product might be ruined . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if they show us the picture of the product prr to being sold in the market , most probably people will not buy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion , being trustwothy in giving advertisements is not a required behaviour in the area of business . <\s>
<s> People show their products in such a way that they look better than they really are due to aforementioned reasons such as : why actually they are giving advertisements , at certain time points advertisements are necessary and the product we buy is apparently distinct from the one we see . <\s>
<s> Eventually , these ideas support the hypothesis that advetisements make these products seem better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Using a formula such as ` It is better to ' is always a dangerous thing when we are not provided with more precise context . <\s>
<s> In this case , whether one should favor a broad knowledge of varied subjects or focus on one specific topic is all a matter of what one is trying to achieve and in what field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Take the example of medicine : some doctors opt for the broadest instruction possible so as to be able to deal with most common diseases affecting all parts of the body while others decide to become specialized in a particular organ , or type of ailment . <\s>
<s> Which one is ` better ' ? <\s>
<s> The only possible answer to this question is that one needs both at different times and that both are important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a German and English undergraduate , I will deal with the issue in the domain I know best : the academic field of literature as it is taught in Belgian universities . <\s>
<s> It is striking to watch the evolution in the academic programs from the 1st year to the final one : quite clearly we start by learning the overall framework . <\s>
<s> Let 's take an example from my second college year : one of my favorite classes ever was called Survey of English Poetry which very much covered everything from the prehistory to the 1950s . <\s>
<s> Now let 's take an example from my final year : ` Shakespeare and the crossing of generic boundaries ' . <\s>
<s> Not only did this class focus on one particular author , it focussed on one particular aspect of this particular author 's works . <\s>
<s> The move from broad topic to specific subject is self-explanatory . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So much for facts . <\s>
<s> I would argue that the best way of approaching the issue at hand here is to think chronologically . <\s>
<s> In a first phase , I would definitely promote the acquisition of a fairly broad knowledge of a high number of subjects . <\s>
<s> Having access to the widest possible variety of topics is one of the best ways to learn what curiosity is all about - and I mean curiosity in the good sense of the word ( not nosiness ) . <\s>
<s> I strongly believe that curiosity is one of the qualities required if one is to live life to the full . <\s>
<s> Also , getting a sense of the big picture first is a good way to discern in a second phase what specific subject appeals to us most . <\s>
<s> I believe you need to learn the bases of art history before you can realize at all that you like impressionism and Pre-Raphaelitism best . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> After this first phase , then , I do n't see what is wrong with concentrating on and digging deeper into a patricular topic . <\s>
<s> At college , we are asked on several occasions to make such narrowing choices : I wrote research papers on George Gissing 's novel ` New Grub Street ' , Uwe Timm 's latest novel , a poem by John Updike ( A poem by ONE particular author ) . <\s>
<s> And I think this is a very good thing too . <\s>
<s> My undergraduate thesis , in particular , helped me identify a pretty specific topic which I would like to research further and possibly turn into a Ph.D. : the impact of indutrialization on artistic production in the second half of the 19th century in England . <\s>
<s> I do not regard this process as restrictive . <\s>
<s> This kind of specific research is extremely rewarding . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I would say that both approaches can be supported and that they should not be mutually exclusive . <\s>
<s> A broad approach is a necessary gfirst step before one can narrow down one 's interests further . <\s>
<s> And since we got eh bigger picture too , notyhing stops us from developing many different specific interests overtime ... <\s>
<s> I do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> In today 's society young people spend a lot of time in front of their computers , watch television or just hang around on the streets . <\s>
<s> Not many are interested in what is happening around their little world that might not go further then their room and computer desk . <\s>
<s> From my point of view , young people should be more concerned about other people in their communities , especially the elderly . <\s>
<s> By helping for example in nursery homes or places for disabled people , adolescents learn to respect people that are different and in need . <\s>
<s> They need to realize that they might be in need as well when they are older and how essential it is that there is help for those people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many young people in our society suffer under a lack of motivation and do n't have any goals in their lifes . <\s>
<s> By supporting projects like building a new public playground they learn how good it feels to accomplish a goal and work in a team . <\s>
<s> In many cities , children are aggressive and randomly distroy building , playgrounds or other common sites . <\s>
<s> By building something by themselves , they learn to value things and to respect other people 's property or belongings . <\s>
<s> For many years , my church group and I organized local flea markets to support the nursery home and other social institutions . <\s>
<s> It not only helped me to find many good friends and build a strong relationship to the people in our community , but the happy faces and wide smiles of the people who we supported I will never forget in my life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When children become part of a community , they learn to respect other people and get satisfaction by achieving something . <\s>
<s> They get compliments by adult which gives them confident and the feeling they are accepted and not treated `` o <\s>
<s> First of all , it 's hard to say if there will be or if there wo n't be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today . <\s>
<s> This issue has to be discussed , and both points of view have to be advocated through good and reliable arguments . <\s>
<s> On the one hand , I think that the number of cars will increase in the next two decades . <\s>
<s> Indeed , there will be more people allowed to pass the driving license . <\s>
<s> Everyday , the earth population is increasing so , it 's mathematicly logical that there will be more cars in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> Furthemore , I think that there will be more automobiles because of , or should I say `` thanks to '' , the development of tourism . <\s>
<s> Along the years , people have used to use the cars for going on vacations for exemple . <\s>
<s> As well , the more the society is changing and evoluating , the more people can provide them with a car , this locomotion mean is no longer a good for rich people . <\s>
<s> As well , we live in a period where it has become natural to use our cars . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , we take the car to go to the supermarket as well as to go to the butchery with is 500 meters far from our house . <\s>
<s> Because of the development of the automobile industry , we have become completely lazy or , at least , we tend to become very lazy ... <\s>
<s> On the other side , I think it 's possible that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years : as a matter of fact , people are more concerned about the environment and we can see the emergence of new environmental organisations struggling against car pollution . <\s>
<s> Furthemore , the governement might have planned to make downtown Paris , a discrict where people will have to pay for entering it . <\s>
<s> In London , the congestion charge was implemented a couple of years ago and there is fewer cars and less pollution in the center of the British capital city , according to the environmentalists people . <\s>
<s> Moreover , a lot of people take the commun transport to go to work , to go out at night so , why would this change ? <\s>
<s> A lot of inhabitants of Paris have understood that it was more simple to move by the subway or bus instead of by car . <\s>
<s> My last arguments will be that the cost of oil will increase for sure ... <\s>
<s> That will be prevent people for using their cars as they usually do ! <\s>
<s> The statement says that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , in twenty years . <\s>
<s> However , I do not think that the number of cars will decrease in twenty years . <\s>
<s> I have two reasons to support my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , cars are the most convenient vehicle we have ever had to move wherever we want to go . <\s>
<s> For example , most places on the earth cannot be reached only by other means such as trains , airplanes , or by foot . <\s>
<s> I imagine that globalization will have spread more in twenty years , which means that people will move more actively than they do now . <\s>
<s> When pople move more actively , cars must be the most convenient tool to satisfy their desire to move . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , if more cars are produced , the price of cars will decrease , which results in more people to be able to afford cars . <\s>
<s> When considering the world population will get enhanced in twenty years , I am convinced that more people will posses cars than now . <\s>
<s> Thus , there is no chance to think about the decrease in the number of cars in use . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , there are hundreds of car manufacturers in the world . <\s>
<s> I do not think they will reduce their number of products , because their profit may decrease by doing so . <\s>
<s> Manufacturers are good at marketing and catching consumers ' needs in the first place . <\s>
<s> Naturally so are car manufacturers . <\s>
<s> The world concern may be inclined to eco-friendly system in twenty years , but I am sure that car manufacturers will create those cars which match the needs of consumers and of the earth in twenty years as well as they do now . <\s>
<s> Additionally , there have never been periods when the number of cars decreased so far . <\s>
<s> Therefore , it is likely that this trend will continue , as long as car manufacturers desire to produce many cars under the support of appropriate marketing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , because of these two reasons cited above , I disagree the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are now today . <\s>
<s> I fully agree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For me , the main purpuse of an advertisement is to show a product to someone ( a person , a group of people , a company , etc ) in order to sell it to the person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So what other way to sell a product than show it the best way possible . <\s>
<s> And if the product is not so good or not that good looking , the only way to convince the audience that this product is worth buying is by showing it a tiny bit better than it really is in fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A great example that I have in mind to illustrate this , is the following one : When you are waiting in a fast food , restaurent and you are looking at the pictures of the food you are about to order , you always see all the french fries lined-up and '' facing '' you . <\s>
<s> You always see the food displayed in those posters in a way that you have never seen it on your table . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The reason food is more attractive on the posters is that the servers , would not have time to re-arrange every french fry in order before you eat it . <\s>
<s> And of course , there is no way that a fast food brand displays it 's fries just like it is in real life , because nobody would order it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some might say that if the product is really good , there is no need to make it seem better than it actually is . <\s>
<s> And again , this is usually wrong . <\s>
<s> Let 's take for example a big brand . <\s>
<s> Whatever products they manufacturing , they will probably be another company out there that is selling the same product ( usually a little bit different ) . <\s>
<s> In order for the first company to sell its product more that the competitor , the company needs to invest on a advertisement . <\s>
<s> And the main goal of the advert is to show that the product is better than any other one that looks the same or have the same functionalities . <\s>
<s> So basicly the advert has to show that the product is better than the other , so probably also better than it in fact really is . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And finally , is a product is really good , there is probably nood need to make an advert in the first place as it will be a self selling product . <\s>
<s> I am now 23 years old and if you notice I am from an economy that has held itself even after the national fabric threatens to break down every second day . <\s>
<s> Something or the other just keeps happening in this nation of millions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What has given birth to this never say die attitude ? <\s>
<s> the normal conclusion will be that its the new generation that holds in its hands the reigns of a powerful and majectic nation . <\s>
<s> The pertinent answer to that will be yes the youngsters are responsible for its community . <\s>
<s> I totally disagree to the statement ` that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am of the same genre that we talk about here . <\s>
<s> I would ask how have I not served my community ? <\s>
<s> I have taught in blind school that exists just beyond my college , who had forced me to do it ? , nobody . <\s>
<s> The reason why I did it is the fact that I think I am responsible to keep everybody priveledged or underpriveledged at the same level . <\s>
<s> Infact I felt that this is the least I could do to help those who are less fortunate than me . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a rule I do n't believe in giving alms , I feel strongly against the notion that any able bodied person should beg and not work . <\s>
<s> That is what I do , I work , I contribute to the economy , I work , I pay my taxes on time , I have the will to see that my abilities are used to the fullest so that I grow , in turn my agency grows and that will in turn make my economy grow . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If somebody feels that I stiil have not contributed enough to my community then I must add that my community holds adults and children . <\s>
<s> I love and respect both . <\s>
<s> Not only do I spend time with them , I stimulate others to spend time with them too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As an onset I would finish with the statement that I do contribute to my community and I am still counted amongst ` young people ' . <\s>
<s> I will continue doing this because I do n't have a point to prove but the fact that my conscience asks this out me and this is the minimum I can do to make people who matter to me more special . <\s>
<s> I disagree to the statement which promotes having better knowledge in many subjects than to specialize in a specific one . <\s>
<s> The famous quote `` Jack of all trades and master on none '' very appropriately supports my opinion . <\s>
<s> Yes , nature has made everone equal and their is no difference whatsoever in our capabilties . <\s>
<s> What however distinguishes one man from another , are his qualities & deeds . <\s>
<s> Although god has gifted us all with similar capabities , he has also blessed us with different interests & talents . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe that one must specialize in a specific subject to form his own identity . <\s>
<s> Today 's soceity is appreciative of selectively skilled personelle , who add to the growing global economy . <\s>
<s> A highly skilled person is welcomed to relocate in most developed countries . <\s>
<s> This leads to upgradation of class & pay . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Such skilled perons take back to their country additional waetl What one person could achieve effortlessly could be another 's nightmare . <\s>
<s> This difference may not be only attributed to skill . <\s>
<s> Interest in a particular activity substantialy makes the person more keen & happier to do a job . <\s>
<s> This keeps the pressure off him and makes his achieve to the best of abilty . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Imagine a world with no specialists . <\s>
<s> Do we settle for opinions about a fracture from an orthopedic surgeon or would we take a general physician 's word as final for it ? <\s>
<s> Would a plumber be as good if he fixed your electrical fittings as well ? <\s>
<s> Am sure the answer would be `` no '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Being a doctor , I have read through vast syllabi of Human anatomy , Physiology & biochemistry , about the basis of pharmacology , pathology , medicine , surgery and gynecology . <\s>
<s> Though a broad knowledge of all these subjects has helped me understand the basis of origins and functioning of various body systems & their anamolies , I would consider my education incomplete without the specializaton in a particular branch . <\s>
<s> We all have unique interests and it is impertive to take up one in order to thrieve in the todays ' highly competetive work environment , where merely having a broad knwoledge is considered a basic skill and we compete with work force trained in specific tasks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A person 's interest in a specific field keeps the drive to achieve higher & specialize in his subject of interest . <\s>
<s> Youth is the power of a nation . <\s>
<s> A nation 's progress rely majorly on the performance and contribution of its youth . <\s>
<s> A youth , today , has multiple task to handle . <\s>
<s> I believe , most of the young people are under the pressure of perfoming the best . <\s>
<s> This pressure drives them away from their responsibilties . <\s>
<s> They are more focussed on self advancement . <\s>
<s> This focus takes them very far from their source . <\s>
<s> Therefore , young people do not give enough time to help their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am a student and currently pursuing my engineering degree in biotechnology . <\s>
<s> This course demands greater devotion and dedication towards the studies . <\s>
<s> I have to attend college , do projects after college and also participate in various events taking place in my college . <\s>
<s> All these responsibilties does not give me enough time as free . <\s>
<s> Thus , I fail to give a helping hand to my community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Youth is the time of life where one is brimming with energy and enthusiasm of moving ahead in life . <\s>
<s> If this energy will not be manifested to work towards one 's goal then , one 's dream would never be fulfilled . <\s>
<s> Helping and serving the community could happen at any time of life . <\s>
<s> But this golden period of youth will never come back again . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A nation 's progress will uplift if it has youth who are contributing their best in every field . <\s>
<s> Take the example of Sania Mirza who entered the field of lawn tennis in her teen-age . <\s>
<s> Her devotion and dedication towards her game made her popular in the entire world of lawn tennis . <\s>
<s> This also lead to the popularity of our country . <\s>
<s> In other words , she was like an ambassador of India . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Sachin Tendulkar entered cricket when he was nearly 18 years old . <\s>
<s> He made himself and his country proud by his hard work and dedication . <\s>
<s> So , we see that in order to go ahead in life one has to harness energy in one 's field of interest . <\s>
<s> This would eventually require one to give the maximum time to one 's work . <\s>
<s> But this does not mean that one should not give time to help communities . <\s>
<s> This can be done when one is settled in life . <\s>
<s> Then the contribution would be much more and it would be more meaningful.i.e. one can help his community financially , in person or in any other way which is possible . <\s>
<s> Althogh , some people think that students need only to learn the facts , I totally to agree with understanding the concept and the ideas . <\s>
<s> There are many reasons for which students need to understand the basic idea . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the reasons is that the students will only use the concept and the ideas from which they have been taught . <\s>
<s> Understanding the concept is more important than the facts in that the concept can be involved in any suitable application . <\s>
<s> For example , a student in a physics class will propably need to understand the formula before he or she wil be able to solve the problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that when the students learn some facts , it is easy to forget them . <\s>
<s> This is beacuse they need to be memorized . <\s>
<s> Also , every information that is stored in the brain can be lost if it is not used repeatedly . <\s>
<s> Therefore , understanding is much easier than memorizing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An Aditional reason is that understanding is more effective in developing new thing than learning facts . <\s>
<s> To illustrate that , supposed a student in a physics college tried to memorize the content of the course without giving any care to understanding it . <\s>
<s> The student surely will find a lot of troubles in his life if he or she tries to prove a new theory realtive to the information that have been taught . <\s>
<s> Hence , If the student understood the courses without memorizing the content , the student will be able comperhend with the life challenges . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One final reason is that facts does not provide any thinking . <\s>
<s> It is either right or wrong . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , understanding the concept can be duplicated to obtain some other new concepts . <\s>
<s> For example , the conflict between the relativity and the laws of motions cannot be solved unless both of them are understood . <\s>
<s> Once the concept is understood , the solution for such a conflict can be solved . <\s>
<s> Which gave rise into a new concept called `` The String Theory '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , understanding the ideas is much easier than just memorizing the facts that are concret and non-negotiable . <\s>
<s> Its a fact , that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The newer generations are at an advantage when you think of the luxuries , comforts . <\s>
<s> The new inventions and rapidly developing technologies are resposinble for this . <\s>
<s> These are the factors which are very attractive and young people forget their prime duties towards the community which includes their family , school , college , locality and the town or city wherever they live . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> World has become very competitive , you ca n't be successful unless you are calibred and you have exceptional talents . <\s>
<s> In order to resist this , the adults and parents are busy in their works and not giving enough attention and time to motivate the younger ones to perform their prime duties . <\s>
<s> In a way , most of the young people lack in guidance and motivation to help one another . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The influences of certain movies make the young people think wild and a few sports like w.w.f. , gradually turn the young people to start thinking that they are real heroes and thus their thoughts are diverted towards wrong ways . <\s>
<s> Internet , its a bliss for this generation - but in the same time , its often misused too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young children , thesedays love to spend their time with computer in the form of games , chatting and some kids in browsing the bad websites also , which are easily available . <\s>
<s> In the process , the young children are busy with school , homework , time with computer , etc , they spend whole day . <\s>
<s> They do not find any time to mingle with the friends of their age and thus they do not develop any kind of attachment to one another . <\s>
<s> At times , we get to see some children growing in certain families with least attention and love , who gradually turn very materialistic and help in no way to their community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every adult and parents must take up this task as important one and start thinking about the future world . <\s>
<s> They must motivate the younger ones to work towards helping their community , starting from home , school in whatever they way they can . <\s>
<s> The statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do is a fairly debatable statement . <\s>
<s> My opinion on the same is not in favour of the statement . <\s>
<s> I am of the view that one cannot measure how much life can be enjoyed or life is being enjoyed by any one . <\s>
<s> Some one appropriately said `` enjoyment is not a commodity , it is the excitement of life we all live for '' . <\s>
<s> Enjoyment mean different things to different people , different peaople dirive enjoyment out of different things . <\s>
<s> A younger person who is more outgoing enjoys by going partying or meeting people at social events . <\s>
<s> A sports fan enjoys by watching his favourite team winning a championship . <\s>
<s> A young girl enjoys shopping for hours with her friends , whereas an older person derives pleasure and enjoyment by wathcing his/her grandchildren playing in his/her lap or talking to his children about their successus or achievements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Different people have different ways to enjoy life and everyone is entitled to this right . <\s>
<s> So we cannot justify that older people do n't enjoy as much as younger people do . <\s>
<s> Older people have their on ways to enjoy life equaly as much as younger people . <\s>
<s> With age only the speed of ones life decreases but the spirit of life remains the same . <\s>
<s> With age only the amount of activity decreases not the frequency of joyful moments . <\s>
<s> This statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' in my opinion is a superstition . <\s>
<s> One which should not be encouraged . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We should not forget that these very old people were once young themselves and enjoyed life the same way as younger people today . <\s>
<s> The younger people of today will only realize that older people have different ways of enjoyment when they are in their shoes . <\s>
<s> Untill we do n't experience the otherside ourselves we are cannot make a fair judgement . <\s>
<s> In later years advertisenments have increased a lot , especially on tv and newspapers . <\s>
<s> The most part of spots presents product or services in a way that can make them appear better then they really are . <\s>
<s> Many and many tecniques are used to present products enphatising their quality : for example in icecream 's spots they use a camera recording at a very high fps ( frame per second ) and then play the spot at a lower speed . <\s>
<s> Using this tecnique icecreams will appear to be more creamly even if they are n't really like that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I completely refuse the trend to present products in this way . <\s>
<s> In my opinion advertisements must present products or services as they really are . <\s>
<s> Presenting products in such a way is also a risk for the firm : customers may be unsatisfayed by what they have bought if it is n't as the advertisement has presented it . <\s>
<s> Probably they will not buy something from that brand no more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that also governement should do something to stop this trend : for example the State should create a team responsible to verify if products are as they will be presented in spots . <\s>
<s> If a product seems better that it really is , State should punish trasgressors with financial penalties . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays firms must create advertisements that present products better than they are because every firm do that and people will not buy at all products if they seem lower quality than others even from spots . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firms could stop this trend by creating a team controlling all advertisements : firms produce advertisements the best that they can but presenting products as they are . <\s>
<s> Before publishing advertisements the control team will check if the presentation of products is or not corresponding to real products . <\s>
<s> If the check is positive , the advertisement can be published . <\s>
<s> This is also a way to help customers to choose the best product they need . <\s>
<s> University as well as high school students are required to having obtained certain skills by the time they graduate . <\s>
<s> This is what makes their degree valuable . <\s>
<s> The skills can be devided into two main categories : Learning facts and understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> The chairman of Columbia University 's debate club has recently provoked great dispute as he claimed that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree with him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , on the one hand , understanding ideas and concepts is essential for succeeding after college . <\s>
<s> Only if one is able to rethink complicated processes and to find own conclusions , one will be able to improve one 's abilities and will be capable of managing tasks that require improvisation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , this is certainly not possible if you lack the respected facts . <\s>
<s> Facts are therefore even more important than understanding ideas and concepts as they provide the basis for the second group of skills . <\s>
<s> If you do n't even know the facts about a certain topic , then how can you draw conclusions ? <\s>
<s> For example , if a biologist does not know how to define and to describe a somatic cell , can he investigate them and use them for research ? <\s>
<s> Probably not . <\s>
<s> Hence , it is a must for teachers and professors to provide their students with a broad knowledge of facts , no matter if it is in elementary school , in high school or in college . <\s>
<s> Where else should people learn the essentials if not their educational career ? <\s>

<s> In conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is of course a required skill for graduates . <\s>
<s> However , they by far do not play such an important role as facts , or other skills not discussed in this essay , for example the ability to speak coherently and clearly , arguing and solving social problems , or teamwork . <\s>
<s> I do not agree with the statement saying there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years . <\s>
<s> First of all , car industries will not allow such thing to happen . <\s>
<s> In some companies , cars are deliberately built to last less than 10 years , so the owners will buy new cars more often . <\s>
<s> They consistently produce more cars and ways to encourage people to buy and use them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In some countries , even the government encourages automobile consuming . <\s>
<s> Those countries build more and more roads and also expand the already existing ones , so more cars can easily get on the road . <\s>
<s> The government , or the city planner , could have built more railways and mass transportation instead of more roads if they wanted to reduce traffic and pollution , but the government fears that the automobile industry , which is a major part of the country 's economic , will fail to increase if they take such policies . <\s>
<s> Building more roads instead of building complicated mass transport system might also be in fact a cheaper solution , and the only solution available at that time for reducing traffic in the short term . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second aspect of using cars is that the people who have been driving will not easily go back to walking or using mass transportation unless it is a much better substitute for driving . <\s>
<s> Driving and having an own car gives you the kind of privacy not easily gained by using mass transport , and going back to an old habit needs a lot of determination . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The types of cars used today might be used fewer in the future , but new and better types or cars will dominate the future . <\s>
<s> The downside of driving was to have to concentrate on driving and keep an eye on the road , but more and more technical developement allow drivers to drive less and let the artificial intelligence do the work . <\s>
<s> There will also be cars with less , hopefully no pollution . <\s>
<s> The cars will almost definately be much less noisy than the ones today . <\s>
<s> The comfort of driving or riding on cars will consistently increase , because the companies investigate for reserches in those areas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Because of these reasons , the overall number of cars and the usage of them is more likely to increase than decrease . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement given . <\s>
<s> There will be decrease in the number of cars in use over the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> This is because of several contributing reasons which include growing traffic problems , depleting petroleum resources , invention of newer modes of transport , and several other reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the traffic problems in today 's roadways is a major contributing factor . <\s>
<s> The remedies for such problems would prove more costly than inventing a new transport method or developing an alternate transport method . <\s>
<s> The possible cures for today 's traffic hazards and traffic jams could be building more overhead bridges . <\s>
<s> The building of bridges in existing city premises need a lot of funds and planning . <\s>
<s> On the other hand if these efforts were made in the direction of improving railway commuting facility or metro train facilities , it would be more fruitful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The invention newer modes of transport like small range air vehicles or helicopters for transport in the city would facilitate easy as well as faster solutions to such traffic problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Depletion of petroleum resources also has a major role to play in retarding the manufacture of cars at this rate . <\s>
<s> Petroleum goods are used for various other purposes like industrial usages and cooking etc . <\s>
<s> But today most of the petroleum resources are used up in automobile industry . <\s>
<s> To change this scenario , the number of cars would have to be drastically reduced . <\s>
<s> Alternate energy sources like hydrogen fuel cell cars , electric battery cars have not been very successful . <\s>
<s> Therefore the number of cars after twenty years would certainly be a small fraction of the present number . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The technology and developments which enhance the efficiency of cars has almost come to a point of saturation . <\s>
<s> Cars now are bought more because of their beauty in design or brand of the maker , rather than because of their efficiency . <\s>
<s> Even this supports that if there are newer and more fashionable modes of public transport , more and more people will want to commute by those vehicles . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore by looking at the present trends of car design and keeping in mind the depleting resources , i strongly feel that the number of cars in use after twenty years from now would be very few . <\s>
<s> New inventions could easily substitute the automobiles in the near future . <\s>
<s> It is a well known fact that it is only in the hands of the youth that the destiny of a society rests . <\s>
<s> In this fast paced world , there have been arguments galore about the time devoted by young people towards their community . <\s>
<s> On a personal note , I feel that youth nowadays is too pre-occupied with other things and is not contributing quality time to the upliftment of their respective communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This can be illustrated by the fact that not many youngsters are actively involved in the working of the community help groups . <\s>
<s> The members of the council concerned with the problems of a community has a lot of middle aged men or people on the brink of retirement . <\s>
<s> Young people shun away from social responsibility thinking that the time can be more valuably spent in education or in a part-time lucrative job . <\s>
<s> Peer pressure also starts taking its toll . <\s>
<s> Youngsters feel that they should either be in the college , learning , or let their hair down by partying hard . <\s>
<s> They fear coming under criticisim if they get involved in charity work for the community , because they feel it is not a hip or trendy thing . <\s>
<s> Parental concerns also add fuel to the fire . <\s>
<s> Parents have undue expectations on their ward which result in the children working that extra bit hard to live upto them . <\s>
<s> In the process , extra-curricular activities and community work take a back seat due to lack of time . <\s>
<s> In addition , schools and colleges are always concentrating on academic work , whereas the emphasis should also be diverted toward forming clubs for community work . <\s>
<s> Only in a few countries across the world do institutions ask students for active participation in community work . <\s>
<s> The youth should be educated about their involvement in community activities and the benefits it has as the youngsters nowadays feel that earning money is everything in life . <\s>
<s> The lack of awareness on the problems haunting the community in which they live also contribute to the disinterest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus the precious talents and the fresh minds of youngsters are not being put to much use in community work , which , I feel may spell tough times for communities if the trend continues . <\s>
<s> I think that its high time that the youngsters balance their personal life and community work with perfect harmony to make the world a better place . <\s>
<s> Enjoying life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In order to answer the question of who enjoys life more , younger or older people , I think it is vital to look at how each of these groups do actually enjoy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Very young kids seem to need very little to have a good time . <\s>
<s> An empty paper box , and nice puppy , lot 's of mud or just a sunny day can be enough to make them totally happy and enjoy life . <\s>
<s> They might not think about it , or be aware of it , but exactly this carefreeness allows them to make life so wonderfull for them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This behaviour mostly continues into later stages of life , the teens , tweens and probably the thirties . <\s>
<s> During this time people might still enjoy life , but being a lot more reflectory about it . <\s>
<s> Some of them tend to worry too much . <\s>
<s> It is a time when great difficutlies in life might have to be overcome , such as education , first love ( s ) and work . <\s>
<s> I think a lot of external side effects influence the life enjoyment of a single person druing this time period . <\s>
<s> Due to it still being in the first half of a normal life expectancy , I would count this life period to the `` young '' part . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The enjoyment of life in the second half of our life is based on two major factors . <\s>
<s> One is again the external situation . <\s>
<s> Have you found a job or life partner that fulfills you and makes you happy . <\s>
<s> Have you maybe made enough of money to now be able to live a dream life that was not possible otherwise . <\s>
<s> The second very important aspect during this time is the gained life experience . <\s>
<s> Older people seem to have a more relaxed view of life . <\s>
<s> They are not scared or worried as easily . <\s>
<s> Especially very old people that have survived war and famines , great areas and disaster seem to be able to enjoy life with a lot less . <\s>
<s> On the other hand there are those of course that have suffered great hardship by that time , and might even not have a bright future . <\s>
<s> Enjoying life might not be somthing they think about at all . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Perosnally I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I think full and complete enjoyment of life is probably most common and easily reached when we are very young . <\s>
<s> Yet , when external circumstances are right , it is quite possible to have a very enjoyable life to the very end , even if there might be a few downs inbetween . <\s>
<s> The issue of knowing if young people enjoy life more than older people do is a interesting one . <\s>
<s> On the one hand , young people are certainly healthier than the older . <\s>
<s> But on the other hand , older people have a lot of free time to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> However , my firm belief is that it is easily to enjoy life for the young people rather than for the older ones . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , we have to think of the matter of the health . <\s>
<s> It is an undeniable fact that young people are in general healthier than the oldest . <\s>
<s> For example , it is easily to do exercise when you are young . <\s>
<s> Indeed , a lot of old people do have diseases which makes them not unable to do what they want . <\s>
<s> Therefore , if you really like a sport , you will be more able to practice it when you are young . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , young people do not have a long experience of life . <\s>
<s> On the whole , youth may be considered as the time of discoveries , and there are different discoveries . <\s>
<s> Some young people may want to travel all around the world , for example . <\s>
<s> Of course , it is a fact that generally , old people have more money than the youngest . <\s>
<s> But actually , it does not matter ! <\s>
<s> When you are young , you may think that the comfort is not a prevalent point in a trip . <\s>
<s> Whereas most of young people , old people may have difficulties to travel a lot , just because it is really exhausting . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but not least , young people may enjoy life more than older people just because they have less things to matter . <\s>
<s> For example , a young people does not worry about his job , about what he has to pay or not each month . <\s>
<s> A young person has not lived his life yet , and a lot of opportunities are openned to him , he can still decide what is life will be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I would like to say that young people do not often enjoy life more than the older , even if it may appear quite obvious . <\s>
<s> There are also a lot of ways to enjoy life when you are old , because you often have more free-time , and you have much experience than the youngest . <\s>
<s> You can see your children and your children ' children growing , and I think that is one of the beautifulest thing in the world . <\s>
<s> Yes . <\s>
<s> I do agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> And the following explanations shall justify my stand . <\s>
<s> Let us take a quick look at our past . <\s>
<s> Ancient Socities took good care of thier communities . <\s>
<s> They were forums , socities , co-operatives run by th people , for the people . <\s>
<s> And what astonishes me is that even then they were run by the Youth . <\s>
<s> And they had no financial incentive behind it . <\s>
<s> they did it out of the goodness of their heart . <\s>
<s> and while this does sound a little too model for today 's youth we must realize that therein lies the flaw . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today its all about money and a cause . <\s>
<s> The Cause that the we provide does n't cut it . <\s>
<s> The Youth is seen vandalizing the cities . <\s>
<s> Public Property is being abused and degarged as we speak . <\s>
<s> Disrespect is the order of the day . <\s>
<s> And while a few benevolent individuals come together to oppse this , they are persecuted for being too idealistic . <\s>
<s> But this is what the Youth need. a push from the behind in the right direction . <\s>
<s> Community Service was never meant to be a compulsion and it still is n't . <\s>
<s> It will always be one of the best ways to give back to your comunity everything that it has so sparigly provided you . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Through Surveys and Statisitcs we have come to learn that although organizations have developed to promote such service and have intensive schemes to recruit the youth of today they seem to be falling drastically short of manpower . <\s>
<s> Theu either dont get any youth at all , or the youth is severly disintrested at best . <\s>
<s> in such a case even the organizations lose interest . <\s>
<s> Are we willing to let go of Community Service as a whole . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One must consider the fact that maybe the youth just dont feel protective about their community . <\s>
<s> Being Lethargic has become an integral part of who they are . <\s>
<s> It 's not that they dont care , they just dont care enough . <\s>
<s> and while they might attribute this lack of time to studies and other activities , we all know the cliched proverb ' Where there is a will there is a Way '' . <\s>
<s> I believe that if this will can be intensively inculcated into Todays Youth , then all is not lost . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I once walked a little old lady across the street . <\s>
<s> She did n't pay me any money . <\s>
<s> All she said was `` Thank You , Son '' . and maybe thats enough . <\s>
<s> That should drive the youth to help their comunity . <\s>
<s> if they dont help the community they are part of , then who will . <\s>
<s> eventually when they grow old and their community has fallen apart , will they look back and say `` its my fault '' . <\s>
<s> I request every youh to do this think back your answer will define who you are ... <\s>
<s> Everyone knows that adverts are made on purpose to sell , it means that products shown on televivion or in magazine do always look much better than in reality . <\s>
<s> sometimes it happens that you watch an advertisement on television , which tells you that a certain product is exactly what you need . <\s>
<s> Basically they show you many evident qualities , like bright colors or enormous sizes , that are supposed to belong to the object , but once you arrive in the shop you get a huge disappointment : the thing you expected to be big and amazing is usually much smaller and does n't really look like the one you have dreamt about . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This point can easily be explained mentioning the psychology role in making advertisements . <\s>
<s> In fact , what products really need for being sold , is expectation . <\s>
<s> it means that the value of an object is determined by the psycholocical impact this object is able to have on people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Provided that behind every advertisement there is the long and hard work of a brilliant psychologists equipe , people should always try to look at icons through an objective point of view . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For `` objective prospective '' i mean that people should try not to be influenced by external - and sometimes subliminal - messages . <\s>
<s> messages i am talking about are generally used by brands to drive people 's mind in a certain direction . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , according to what i have just analysed , i think that it is very important to be aware of what the bid compasnies are doing through advertisement . <\s>
<s> In my opinion advert - mechanism is a clear example of brain washing : without even know it , in some ways we are forced to do something they want : buy their products . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I reckon that this situation is very dangerous and terrible at the same time : i mean someone is controlling us , isn ' it scary ? <\s>
<s> In my opinion enjoyment in life has lot to do with age . <\s>
<s> It not only requires a source and time to enjoy but alse the spirit and energy required to spend in enjoyment . <\s>
<s> Young people enjoy alot than the older people does because of various reasons . <\s>
<s> Reasons like enery , experiance , spirits and time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people are completely satiated with energy . <\s>
<s> As their muscles are in a growing stage or in an already developed stage , young people find it very easy to enjoy . <\s>
<s> Whether it is a matter of sports , parties or discos or the matter of learning . <\s>
<s> Some sports like the baseball , football , basket ball and many other require an energetic body and grown muscles like in boxing or wresling . <\s>
<s> Older people lack this source required for enjoyement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Due to lack of experiance many young people takin many difficulties as challenge and strive hard to overcome it . <\s>
<s> This in turn excites them , thrills them and provides a means for enjoyment . <\s>
<s> For example when a boy for the first time approaches a pet animal like a dog , he has no knowledge about how the dog may react . <\s>
<s> But when he finds the animal very kind he enjoys in spending time with it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is the confidence and the spirit which the young people have than the older ones . <\s>
<s> When we feel more confident we try to undertake even the most difficult task . <\s>
<s> Getting some tuff time in completing that task surely enjoys us . <\s>
<s> Spirit is an essential requirement to begin and even give an end to something . <\s>
<s> Old people having faced many difficulties in through out there life , lack spirit to do the similar job . <\s>
<s> They find it boring to do the samething which thay have been doing since many years . <\s>
<s> On the other hand young people finds it really exciting to start a task to which they had never been before . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people especially those who has a family and a job to take care of , work lot of hours in their offices . <\s>
<s> These people can hardly find few hours from their busy schedule to even watch a cricket match . <\s>
<s> They spend almost ten hours in their factories , offices or other working places for their earning . <\s>
<s> And the young ones they readily find time for enjoyment . <\s>
<s> As soon as their homeworks got finished and preparations were made , young kids they just go outside their homes to spend a pleasant time playing with their friends or dancing in a party . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , I will only say that young people with no responsibilty of anyone enjoy alot than the elder people . <\s>
<s> Whereas the elders didnt get a chance to enjoy as they have many responsibilait . <\s>
<s> howevwer they enjoyed when they wenwere young . <\s>
<s> I think that it 's not always possible to generalize on psychological topics so , personally , I would neither agree nor disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I would rather say that it depends on individual situations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Take the case of a successful enterpreneur who built up a business in a steady industry without taking risks , and maximized his profits this way . <\s>
<s> From his experince he learned that things go well without changes . <\s>
<s> It is unlikely that he is inclined to change his mind after having success with not taking risks . <\s>
<s> Although he 's successful ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Or take the case of someone speculating on stock prices . <\s>
<s> He has learned , that if you hesitate too long , your profits will be below expectations since stock markets underlie extreme fluctuations . <\s>
<s> Such a person would take risks if he is successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other side there are people who are inspired by their success to try out new things . <\s>
<s> They are not satisfied with the goals they reached so far and thus think of themselves as capable to reach enw horizons . <\s>
<s> Also , as they reach a certain degree of excellence , and build up stong basis of existing business relationships they become more confident to make a risky decision or try to walk a new path . <\s>
<s> There will be always that `` net '' to catch them if they fall . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , as personal relationships are concerned , I think that truly successful people who are happy with their partner , who have found someone they love , someone to rely upon , are unlikely to take risks unless there are desires buried deep inside of their minds . <\s>
<s> But it such case those people are n't exactly successful but rather hypocritic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact , success is often based on learning from mistakes made in the past . <\s>
<s> The only way to make mistakes and gain experience is actually taking risks and trying out new things . <\s>
<s> This would support the idea that successful people are more open to risks since they know that the best learning is often learning from mistakes , sometimes your own . <\s>
<s> Nowadays many people look for ways in order to decrease the number of cars in use . <\s>
<s> Although I would like to see that quantity of automobiles on decreases , I do not believe that this is a possible trend for the near future . <\s>
<s> Simply speaking , there are more incentives for people to buy and use cars than there are reasons to abandon them . <\s>
<s> I will try to make a short list of these incentives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , the population on earth is growing continuously , which means that there are many new people who want to have cars . <\s>
<s> As a result of huge advertising campaigns carried out by automobile firms which want to maximize their profits , a social image has been created for cars . <\s>
<s> People now think that a car improves their mobility and is an indicator of their socio-economic status . <\s>
<s> Moreover , young people also want to have their own cars , which makes them `` cool '' . <\s>
<s> As a result , the demand for new cars is very high in almost every country on teh world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another trend which would avoid a decrease in the number of cars is the unpopularity of mass transit systems . <\s>
<s> Since the cities are growing constantly and funds of governments and local administration cannot grow as rapidly as cities , it becomes harder to travel within the city using the overcrowded mass transit systems . <\s>
<s> Therefore , many people prefer to have a car and use it especially in the busy hours of the day . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Due to the fascinating technological advancements , it becomes easier for people to buy a new car , because technological advancements enable a decrease in prices . <\s>
<s> Bank credits and other kinds of financial assistance are offered to people who want to have cars and most people use these opportunities to have a new car and keeping the older one for other members of the family . <\s>
<s> In the early 21st century , it is now widely accepted that a nuclear family has more than one car , sometimes even all members have their own car : Another inclination which hardens a worldwide decrease in the number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The continuous growth of population coupled with the strong social image of automobiles , unpopularity of mass transit systems and price decreases indicate that a decrease in the quantity of automobiles is not possible for the near future . <\s>
<s> Considering the environmental dangers of having moer cars , on the other hand , governmental and non-governmental organizations should seek and promote options other than cars . <\s>
<s> As much as I wish for it to be true for the sake of the environment and the future of of our ecological system , I have a hard time agreeing with the statement : `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today . '' <\s>
<s> Ever since the introduction of the `` T-Model '' by Henry Ford using mass production technologies in the 1920's , the number of cars has started to increase in exponential factors . <\s>
<s> This is due to a number of factors which I believe are irrevocable in our modern day world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , our technology is changing at such a fast pace that we do not know if and how to tame it . <\s>
<s> Thus , it is becoming ever easier to design and manufacture cars . <\s>
<s> The number and variety of car models abundant in our everyday life is natural proof for this point . <\s>
<s> There is wide range of cars available for sorts of tastes and budgets . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , as the world economy progresses , the purchasing power of nations and individuals increase although not at the same rate . <\s>
<s> For example , even though let us say that some 3rd world countries are not as rich as their European or North American counterparts , the streets are jammed with cars in capitals of India , Egypt , etc . <\s>
<s> Cars are becoming more and more accessible in the remotest and the most impoverished locations . <\s>
<s> Whereas it was not easy for a young woman from Kazakhistan to own her own car , it is not as unthinkable today as it once was . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , I believe that we , as individuals , are becoming more and more addicted to our cars . <\s>
<s> Whereas a household used to have one car in the 1970's or so , now the number of cars per household is increasing rapidly . <\s>
<s> This is in part necessitated by the rapid and hectic lifestyles brought about by the modern world and in part by what we call `` conspicious consumption '' in economics . <\s>
<s> If your neighbour changes to a better version , you like to do the same due to psychological factors even though your current car may be perfectly functional and comfortable . <\s>
<s> This naturally `` drives up '' the market for cars . <\s>
<s> We cannot think of ourselves without our cars . <\s>
<s> Our daily routines are completely disturbed if we have to go to the office without our car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result of these and similar factors which I believe to be irrevocable , the number of cars will continue to increase despite environmental concerns . <\s>
<s> I also believe that this trend will continue for even more than twenty years . <\s>
<s> However , it is a comforting thought that the negative effects may be somewhat decreased if car manufacturers start focusing on enviromentally friendly hybrid and diesel models . <\s>
<s> As the development of transportation , people travel more . <\s>
<s> The most common way of travelling is like this : going to a travel agency , flying to a place with a group people , listening what the tour guide said and flying back . <\s>
<s> I do n't , however , admire this `` common way '' and never consider it the best way of travelling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The biggest problem brought by having a tour guide is the absence of freedom . <\s>
<s> You have to go to one place after another exactly as the fixed plan . <\s>
<s> The schedule was full of different arrangements and you could rarely get the chance of walking around alone in such circumstances . <\s>
<s> For instance , I once went to Hong Kong on my own while a friend of mine went there with a group of people and a tour guide . <\s>
<s> As soon as she met me in Hong Kong , she started to complain about her trip . <\s>
<s> She said that she could n't go to the place she really wanted , eat food she liked , and even the shops she loved . <\s>
<s> All she did was taking buses to different places and walking around as a walking machine . <\s>
<s> She was very upset about her trip and did n't find any pleasure in it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another nightmare brought by group touring is shopping -- a group of tourists are often brought into a shop by the tour guide and forced to buy products . <\s>
<s> This is quite true in some coutries according to my own experience . <\s>
<s> Since guides could get money from the shops , you may be badly treated by the tour guide if you did n't buy anything . <\s>
<s> Nobody could have a nice trip in such cases , is n't it ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For me , I prefer going to places myself , without a tour guide or other unknown people . <\s>
<s> When I travelled to Hong Kong , I only booked my plane tickets and hotel , for a cheaper price , by travel agency . <\s>
<s> My travel is like this : I walked in the streets of Hong Kong , went to those small local shops that a tour guide would never introduce to you , eat those really `` Hong Kong '' food that you may never eaten in a big restaurant , and talked with local people about their daily life . <\s>
<s> These are things you could never have when attending a group and led by a guide . <\s>
<s> Leading by a guide is an experience of `` viewing and listening '' , but not travelling ; only when you walked in a city or a place of interest on your own , can you find its charm and fall in love with travelling . <\s>
<s> Do younger people enjoy life more than older people ? <\s>
<s> This has been much debated and in my opinion , the older people enjoy life much more than younger people . <\s>
<s> There are several reasons to support my reasoning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , older people have lived most of their years and have been through a lot of stress filled and busy life . <\s>
<s> Now its time for them to sit back and relax and pick up other activites for which they probably didnt have time during their younger years . <\s>
<s> Whereas , the younger generation is more concerned with accumulating more wealth and improve his career . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , the youth is busy planning his future and supporting his family . <\s>
<s> He has several worries and the current lifestyles do not allow him to enjoy life to the fullest . <\s>
<s> He needs to be completely focussed at his career and compete against each other . <\s>
<s> Meanwhile , older people generally have achieved most their goals from a career point of view , tend to look at life in a more relaxed manner . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , the older man is wiser and knows the importance of enjoying life better that a younger person . <\s>
<s> For instance , older people tend to spend their precious time travelling across the globe or spending time with family as compared to younger people who are bound to their work for most part of the year . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> While a few might argue that the youthful exuberance would edge out over older people , in my opinion older people enjoy their life more having achieved most of their goals on the professional front and are in a better position to take up new hobbies and new activites . <\s>
<s> Is it the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide ? <\s>
<s> Some people might say yes to the subject . <\s>
<s> However , it is my view that it is not the best to travel in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> In other words , people cannot fullfil their desires and needs during the journey if they were in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> The examples of Leonardo Da Vinci , thugs ( or horse-riding buglars ) in rural areas of China , and Herman Merville validate my statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When people talk or read an article about the graceful and glorious days of Renassiance , people soon encounter a familiar name called Leonorado Da Vinci . <\s>
<s> Leonardo Da Vinci has renowned from those days of Renassiance for his ginuine intellectual accomplishments over the various subjects : Art , Sciensce , herbalogy , anatomy and so forth . <\s>
<s> However , not many people are aware of Leonardo Da Vinci as a travler . <\s>
<s> Da Vinci made all his trips alone ( or with a servant at his service ) through out the European Continent as one of his favorite activity when there was a demand for his cunning hands at various subjects . <\s>
<s> Da vinci also took a lot of shor-trip to fullfil his desire for more knowledge and observation which meets his interests . <\s>
<s> Da Vinci was the man who knows the taste of traveling alone . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is not very common ( or well-known ) fact that there is still horse-riding buglars in rural areas of China . <\s>
<s> And people feel more arkward when it comes to their ears that this is something going on as a current event . <\s>
<s> What does this do with the wellness of the people who frequently goes to China traveling alone ? <\s>
<s> Nothing pretty much unless you are a ever-wonderer who always seeks the scarcely inhabited lands . <\s>
<s> Moreover , these buglars are mostly caught for the safetly of lonely travelers who even wants to travel undeveloped lands of China . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is a great guest from Literature , Herman Merville when you talk about the one who seeked out the wilderness of nature . <\s>
<s> Herman Merville made such great deeds on his work of The Whale ( Or The Moby Dick ) after whaling although he travled not alone and rather accompanied and guided with experienced ones toward whaling . <\s>
<s> However , whaling or sailing has been always the subject of great travlers whether they like to travle alone or not they accompanied and guided with more experienced ones since there has been always no choice since traveling on the seas has to have a group work ( in most terms ) unless you are a lonely sailor with a small boat which goes not far away from ashore . <\s>
<s> Herman Merville would have not been recalled as a great writer if he had not been a great sailor as he has been renowned . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All the instances from Art , History and Current-events validate my statement . <\s>
<s> It is always the best to travel lonely . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> I believe that in life people have to change their normal habitat and go through different changes in order to succeed . <\s>
<s> When people are accustomed to see the same things every day and lack change in their lives , sooner or later they will develop a sense of insecurity and may even get scared to the change . <\s>
<s> I am not trying to say that people should make increasing or sudden changes in their daily , basis of life , but instead , to be more enduring and accept change if it is possible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , in the movie `` Homeless to Harvard '' , the protagonist , Liz , was born with a drug addict mother , and a father who does not take responsability of her . <\s>
<s> Liz inly faces negative aspects of life and does not even go to school . <\s>
<s> For example , instead of her mother taking care of her , Liz is the one who takes care of her mother while being a teenager and has a lack of responsible parent figure . <\s>
<s> After her mother dies , Liz is left lonely and the only thing that gives her security is her encyclopedia because is the only key she had to learn , after never going to school . <\s>
<s> Liz goes through a shocking change in her life that probably no one would imagine because she gets rid of that awful past and decides not to be like the familiar world she sees , but get educated and go to school . <\s>
<s> After two years of studying , she entered Harvard University . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Liz goes through a change in her life that brings her from completely unsuccesful to completely successful . <\s>
<s> She is able to complete her dream and what she wanted to do most in her life an would never have imagined . <\s>
<s> People who have negative feelings among their lives should use change as a defense mechanism . <\s>
<s> People should not dwell among their past or present , they should endure it and seek for possibilities of a better life . <\s>
<s> Taking risks may be a huge factor and also difficult because people always see a change as something insecure . <\s>
<s> This is why , as stated before , succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> It is quite easier for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Hypothetically speaking , students learn some theory or phenomenon in a certain academic field and they have to take a test about it . <\s>
<s> Here is a student who just memorize the facts which a teacher explained in the classroom . <\s>
<s> This student does not try to understand the main ideas and concepts about it at all , but believes that he or she knows everything that the teacher explained for test . <\s>
<s> The other student tries to understand the main ideas and concepts for the test , but he or she does not memorize the whole note . <\s>
<s> As for the result of the test , the first student and second one can have the same grade or the first student who memorizes the facts can have a higher grade than the other ; I think it depends on the questions which the teacher askes for the test . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> No matter what grade two students get for the test . <\s>
<s> No matter who gets higher grade . <\s>
<s> The important matter is that the first student who learns facts cannot apply what he or she learns for other relevant academic fields and also when the student goes to a college for the advanced education , he or she will have trouble with having own thoughts and ideas related with what he or she learns . <\s>
<s> It is the reason that the student does not know how to understand the main ideas and concepts and also does not know how to think about them to make them as own thoughts and ideas . <\s>
<s> The student can eat the apple when someone gives to him directly , but if it is not , he or she cannot eat it because he or she does not know how to pick . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the other student who keeps studying as trying to understand ideas and concepts can develop the concepts that he or she learned before while studying at college because he or she knows how to make the ideas and concepts as own and how to think and apply them for the further or relevant academic fields . <\s>
<s> This student knows how to pick up the apple now , so he or she does not need to wait for someone who gives . <\s>
<s> Whenever he or she wants to eat it , the student take the apple from the tree and eat it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , when students really want to learn something for their own , they have to understand ideas and concepts first . <\s>
<s> Personally I agree with the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> There are three amin reasons for saying so . <\s>
<s> First , becuase they are young , they are physicaly tough and healtheir than older people . <\s>
<s> They can enjoy physical sports such as soccer , futball , etc . <\s>
<s> On the other hand old people have less stamina and they will have to stop even if thy want to go on . <\s>
<s> Their joints , bones and musles are weaker , causing injury . <\s>
<s> This will stop them from most of the sports that they like and enjoyed when they were young . <\s>
<s> So they wil think back to the days when they were young and feel that they would like to go back to that days . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , younger people have better looking than older people . <\s>
<s> As we get old , our skin will be not smooth , there will be less hair , etc . <\s>
<s> So they even enjoy thereselves , their own looking , but once they are old they will not be satified by their own look . <\s>
<s> Their wife or husband will look hansome or beautiful when they are young . <\s>
<s> This might not be true for everyone , but partners will look at each other and think he/she are not good looking as he/she was / This now-days leads to a devorse of couple . <\s>
<s> The number couples devorsing when they get to middle ages is increasing . <\s>
<s> That questions whether they married to each other becuase they loved the partner of loved the look of partner . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , there will be more friends when people are young . <\s>
<s> I might sound too realistic , but as people get old they pass away and there will be less people that you know of . <\s>
<s> My grandparets are saying that in every class union , there will be less people . <\s>
<s> Either they are physically unable to attend or they had passed away . <\s>
<s> This is similar to the fact that there will be less friends , but also there will be less family members or relatives . <\s>
<s> So they will feel lonely and left out when all the family members and close relatives are gone . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I might be able to come up with more reasons , but I will stop here . <\s>
<s> It sounds just too sad to talk about it . <\s>
<s> I will be old some day and I am getting older every year , although I am still young . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I heard from some people that they want to die before they get really old , becuase they can not `` live '' with the situation that they would be in when they are old . <\s>
<s> I hope that this is not teh way I should be . <\s>
<s> I hope I will be able to enjoy my life as much as I am enjoying now . <\s>
<s> As long as God keeps me alive , I will thank Him and live my life following His words . <\s>
<s> I think that not enjoying the life or even feel like want to die , is an act of cursing God . <\s>
<s> I am a Christian , so I want to be able to thank God and enjoy anytime . <\s>
<s> But I have to admit that I would enjoy better if I am young . <\s>
<s> I really love sports , so I would really miss playing soccer , tennis , table tennis , badminton , etc . <\s>
<s> Well I got a bit off the road but this is how I think about the topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So from these reasons , I agree that young people enjoy life more than older peopld do . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is group tourings led by a guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , group touring can give several benefits : proving some good informations , making friends with peopel with different background , etc . <\s>
<s> But as far as I am concerned , I believe that it is best to travel alone or travel with a few friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I like organizing tour schedule and preparing for travels . <\s>
<s> I search good informations about my touring in the web sites . <\s>
<s> We can have a lot of valuable information about cheap price hotels , affordable rent cars , or wonderful sightseeings . <\s>
<s> In contrast , a group tour ususally makes me be very passive . <\s>
<s> I do n't like being passive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I feel more free and comfortable when I prepare for my own travel . <\s>
<s> Group travel ususally provides rigid time schedul and travel itinery . <\s>
<s> But I enjoying freely choosing our schedul and places to visit . <\s>
<s> Our schedul always can be adjusted based on our situations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thridly , I love driving my car when I make a trip to historical sites , parks and mountaints with beautifual scenary , or cutting-edgy cities such as New York , L.A . <\s>
<s> In contrast , I cannot drive cars when I become a member of group tour guided by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Driving cars , especially in the highways , makes me feel relax and happy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , I do n't think that group touring provide cheap prices . <\s>
<s> It usually need a lot of money to participate in group travel . <\s>
<s> I believe , preparing our own travel can help us save a lot of money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , group touring is not best option for me because it makes me feel more passive , less freee , and very often the price is so expensive . <\s>
<s> I prefer traveling based on my own schedul and plan . <\s>
<s> It is a common saying that older people do n't have so much fun in life than younger people . <\s>
<s> Or that you have to use the time when you are young , because the old age comes very fast and then there is nothing left in life that you can enjoy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , it is a very controverse topic to be discussed if young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> I disagree with this statement , because there are many reasons that show the difference . <\s>
<s> There is a saying telling that you are always as young as you feel . <\s>
<s> I think that is perfectly right . <\s>
<s> My mother who is 52 years old does n't behave like she is over 50 which is a very old age for young people . <\s>
<s> She wears modern clothes like my sisters and I and she listens to the same music . <\s>
<s> She does what she wants to do and enjoys life as much as possible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another point is that you ca n't say to an old maybe also handicapped person that he or she does n't enjoy life . <\s>
<s> A friend of my grandmother is about 76 years old and despite her leg injury she enjoys life and has a very positive attitude . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An example of how she enjoys life are her various trips with a group of older people . <\s>
<s> Twice a year this group travelles to places in Europe by bus . <\s>
<s> They do n't go hiking anymore , but they visit museums or famous buildings . <\s>
<s> In addition to that , they are together with many people at the same age and with the same interests . <\s>
<s> Everytime this woman comes home from one of those trips she is really happy , because she has enjoyed it so much that she wants to go on the next trip again . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Concluding I can say that by regarding various older people I 'm sure that older people enjoy life as much as young people do . <\s>
<s> The only difference is that the activities and events which make people enjoy life might differ between young and old . <\s>
<s> I completely agree with the statement : even though facts are important , I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> In facts , sometimes ideas and concepts are behind a fact , they are the main causes of them : understanding them is the best way to have a real comprehension of the facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I will show two examples that can support my opinion . <\s>
<s> In a scientific theory , for example the theory of gravity , I think that the most important thing to know is the main concept of the theory : an object is attracted by the center of the Earth , because everything in the Universe has a force of attraction because of its mass . <\s>
<s> This is the concept , the basic idea of the theory : understanding it it 's more important than studying the formula . <\s>
<s> Once I have understood this concept , I can study the facts : the formula of the Earth 's gravity , how scientists discovered this theory , what experiments were made in order to demonstrate it et cetera ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the same way , I think that is more important to understand ideas and concepts also in other subjects . <\s>
<s> For instance , it could be really important in history . <\s>
<s> For example , when someone has to study the period of the fascism , in Italy and in Europe in general , I think that a good comprehension of the fact should focus on the societies in these years , on the economical conditions of these countries after the I World War , on what people though after a terrible event that happened in Europe before . <\s>
<s> Facts , dates , events , are important , but in my opinion come in a second time . <\s>
<s> If a student does not understand that fascism can occur when a man with a big personality has the power where there is a particular , social and economical situation in a country , he will not understand the main causes of the event . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if he understand it , he could understand the causes of fascism and why some european countries have had a dictatorship after the World War I . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think that ideas and concepts are fundamental in order to understand the causes of something , then facts derives from these causes . <\s>
<s> I would like to respond to this question by saying that I strongly agree with the statement presented . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , most advertisements do , indeed , make products seem much better than they truly are . <\s>
<s> I would like to back up my opinion by introducing several arguments , ranging from the tremendous expansion of the advertising industry to such common examples as McDonalds . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the past years , the advertising industry has grown faster than almost any other industry . <\s>
<s> If the quality of many goods was as amazing as often claimed by its producers , such a huge amount of promotion would not be necessary . <\s>
<s> The most popular example is the fast rise of the search engine Google , which generates tremendous amounts of money from its advertising activities . <\s>
<s> This helped the founders of Google to become two of the richtest people in the world in a remarkably short period of time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In its frequent advertising campaigns , McDonalds claims that its products are not only delicious but also very healthy . <\s>
<s> Scientic studies , however , have found that the so-called ` fast food culture ' is one of the most significant reasons for the enourmous increase in overweighted people in the United States . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , many people are not aware this is not only a problem for the individuals themselves but will also have devastating effects on society as a whole , given the large amount of health costs these people will produce . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example of misleading advertisements are the spots procuced by the banking industry . <\s>
<s> Many large investment bank promise prospective clients less risk or higher returns that can be achieved by investing in secure assets like government bonds . <\s>
<s> However , the burst of the internet bubble in the year 2000 and the subsequent bear market in stocks has shown that none of those high-profile financial instituions was able to life up to their promises . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the recent growth of the advertising industry and the promotion campaigns of several household names such as McDonalds clearly prove that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and often provide prospective customers with misleading information . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is about the number of cars that will be present in about twenty years from now . <\s>
<s> I strongly disgree that the number of cars would decrease in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason to support my belief would be the population of the world . <\s>
<s> The population in this world is increasingly so drastically that there is no question of decrease in the number of cars in any way in the near future . <\s>
<s> If anything , i think that there will actually be a sharp increase in the number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays having a car of the latest model and technology is a style statement . <\s>
<s> So much so that teenagers demand really expensive cars from their parents at a very young and impressionable age . <\s>
<s> On an average every family might have eventually have two cars eventually as the children grow up . <\s>
<s> I would like to quote a very personal example in this context . <\s>
<s> My own brother had his own car when he was about eighteen years old , when he entered his undergraduation college . <\s>
<s> And as generally expected by now he is really `` bored '' with his car and wants to change it and consequently my mother has to weekly dispose numerous pamplets of various cars that my brother gets home in order to convince my father to buy him a new car . <\s>
<s> In my immediate family of about fourteen members ( of which seven are teenagers ) we own about seven cars . <\s>
<s> Exactly half the number of the members of teh family and the family is only going to increase . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , the various advertisements on television and the huge hoardings all over a city successfully entice sybarites . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It has been noticed that the richer are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer . <\s>
<s> The rich indulge themselves and pamper themselves and their family with the most expensive cars and other commodities such as mobiles etc . <\s>
<s> But one cannot deny the convenience associated with owning car . <\s>
<s> One doesnt have to be dependent on public transport which is time consuming and often makes a person irritable and hence more inclined to the idea of owning a car and dwelling in its luxury . <\s>
<s> Alll this will further enhance an increase in the number of cars in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would like to mention one instance which i think is relevant to the topic . <\s>
<s> I was having a conversation with a close friend of mine who takes a fancy for one particular car called ` Swift ' . <\s>
<s> She told me that the first thing that she will do when she saves sufficient money is to buy that car which she loves . <\s>
<s> She is not teh only one who dreams about such a thing , there are thousands of people out there who have such plans for their ` future ' . <\s>
<s> Currently i am living in a city which is famous rather infamous for its traffic and innumerous cars , attrbuted to the IT development in the city and not one day passes by when i dont complain about this fact . <\s>
<s> Recently , while i was reading a local newspaper i came across a survey of the number of cars in teh city and its rapid growth , which predicted an increase in the number of cars and this further strengthens my view on this topic . <\s>
<s> I would like to go with the idea that younger people can enjoy life more vividly than older people do . <\s>
<s> There are many significant factors to support this idea of younger people exploring the life as much possible as they can and how they go about life in a manner to have sweet memories for their rest of life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If I consider a teenage boy/girl , he/she will be having vigor and enthusiasm to go out for parties and hang around with friends which account for their extremely extravagant events which they can cherish later at somepoint in their lifetime after getting older . <\s>
<s> Older people may not have that much energy as the young people to do whatever they want . <\s>
<s> Their physical health may not support their idea to enjoy even though they are very much ready to enjoy . <\s>
<s> Though enjoyment does n't come only in physical form . <\s>
<s> They can also enjoy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people will have to depend upon somebody in their family to go around exploring life as they did when they are young . <\s>
<s> But this may not be possible always as the other members in the family will be having work and responsibilities of their own such as taking care of children , going to office and preferences towards their own enjoyment in life . <\s>
<s> As a result in some societies , the older people are being sent to retirement homes where they share their rest of life with their peers . <\s>
<s> But this is not a good culture as it denies the fact of being together in the family . <\s>
<s> The older people can not enjoy their life as they feel alienated from the society which can worsen the situation . <\s>
<s> They should be regarded as an important part of the society as they love their family members for whom once they cared and gave in all the possible ways for them to enjoy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , enjoyment lies in one 's perception towards it . <\s>
<s> Although younger people can enjoy life more than older people do , they can consider for older people 's enjoyment by mingling with them as they get chances to make the rest of older people 's life lively . <\s>
<s> During his or her education period everybody has to decide wether to base on broad knowledge or to focuss on a specific subject and specialize . <\s>
<s> The choice is difficult and both choices , of course , have different advantages and disadvantages which should be carefully explained in the following . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At first I would like to make the point that all `` high-end-economies '' in generall base on share of works . <\s>
<s> For example in the western world , for instance in the U.S. or in Germany nobody lives only from the crops of his or her own garden . <\s>
<s> Everybody focusses on what he or she can do best and tries to get his own advantages from this behavior . <\s>
<s> Advantage in this context means to earn money . <\s>
<s> This specialization is one core factor of wealth of our nations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore specialization can be called the key to acces in todays societies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As shown above our todays societies are very based on share of works , but I would like to state another important point . <\s>
<s> In my oppinion broad knowledge means mostly few knowledge . <\s>
<s> This might sound strange at first , but let me explain it in a more detailed way : <\s>
<s> If someone , for instance , studies many subjects simular he or she does not have enough time to get into the deepness of every single subject . <\s>
<s> As result the quality of what he or she learned about a single subject is lower than what somebody would have learned who focussed on the one subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly I think that that you should not forget that the education time is usually to short to reach a broad knowledge . <\s>
<s> A `` normal '' student in Germany has for example about 4 years to finish his or her education and to start earning money . <\s>
<s> This is very few time to study two subjects simultanously for instace . <\s>
<s> I have a friend for example who studies economics and engineering and he always claims about to less leisure time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Because of the above mentioned reasons I have come to the conclusion that it is better to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> By specializing myself on ecomomics and wihin this subject especially on taxes and tax law I am very sure to have made the right choice . <\s>
<s> I agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Knowing about different topics is not something that is good only during one 's study life , it is good for as long as we as individuals exist . <\s>
<s> There are situations in which general knowledge is very useful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A way to explain this idea , is with doctors and journalists . <\s>
<s> It is true that later on their professional life medics specialize in one area in specific , but before that , they go through many fields of medicine until they finally reach the desired one . <\s>
<s> In my personal experience I 've known many doctors speciallized in different areas of practice and they have been capable of answering or responding accordingly in different situations . <\s>
<s> The other groups of professionals mentioned earlier , show us that they never confine themselves into only one area . <\s>
<s> It is true that along their career they have the tendency to follow one field , but it is a fact that have to know about other things too . <\s>
<s> Some newspapers have specialized journalist but when they work on shifts , they have to be able to handle every kind of information that shows up , otherwise , there would be an awful lot lost of information . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays , during job interviews , many companies ask their applicants their opinion on different matters and subjects not related to the posting they are applying for . <\s>
<s> They do this in order to ackonwledge how well prepared they are , and to measure the level of literacy the personel has . <\s>
<s> This is a situation that supports the idea expressed at the beggining of this essay . <\s>
<s> Just for the fact that everyday we meet and talk to different people , we see and know for sure that we all have a varied diversity of opinions , this is something that is for our own benefit , so for all these reasons and examples stated before , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Its often believed that young people now are less involved in their community as compared to the past but however i do not agree with this notion . <\s>
<s> I believe that even today young people are as involved as they used to be before . <\s>
<s> They are as willing to give time to hepling their communties as they did before . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Taking an example from my personal experience , i would like to put light on my stance . <\s>
<s> Recently , a very unfair and unfortunate incident occured . <\s>
<s> Outside my school buliding a young poor boy was ruthlesly being beaten up by a man who claimed that the boy was leaning on the bonnet of his car and coming from such a low background he had no right to do so . <\s>
<s> This schocked and alarmed the students and teachers of our school . <\s>
<s> This called for some serious action because this one incident was just reflective of the unjust nature of our society . <\s>
<s> So a group of students and teachers decided to take action against this . <\s>
<s> This group of students and teachers made it a point to report the case to the police and made sure that effective action was taken against the man who had made this fatal mistake . <\s>
<s> Not only that the principal of my school ( a young lady ) went further to provide the young boy with admission in our school for free . <\s>
<s> This is just one arbitary example of an incident that took place on a small scale . <\s>
<s> But however , this example is symbolic of the sensitivity and willingness of young people to help their communtiy even if this requires them to go out of their way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would like to point out an other fact that this is not only the situation in my country but also of the world in general . <\s>
<s> Many incidents of the past support my view . <\s>
<s> Whether it was the 9/11 or the Tsunami , the victims of both these incidents were given tremendous support by the young and the old alike . <\s>
<s> Therefore , i guess it would be wrong to say that young people seem less concerned about the situation of their communtiy only because they seeemed to be more involved in their own work . <\s>
<s> Being involved in your job does n't necesserily imply that you are more selfish . <\s>
<s> Despite the high demands of their work environment young people are still as supportive to their community . <\s>
<s> This is also proved by the fact that today more and more people are parts of NGO 's that work towards the welfare of the people . <\s>
<s> Young people are still as spirited and as motivated to bring about an improvment to their communties and the world in general . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , there are many kinds of transportation for mankind . <\s>
<s> Trains , bicycles , motocycles , airplanes ... <\s>
<s> etc. and most common method of transportation above all is car . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , almost each one of us has at least one car which he or she possesses . <\s>
<s> And as the population increases on and on , the number of cars in use would increase on and on . <\s>
<s> But due to the development of technology in our world , and growing awareness of people towards the environment they live in , I believe that in twenty years of time , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , cars have contributed to lots of pollution going on around our world . <\s>
<s> People are agressive beings . <\s>
<s> They will try to eliminate all the factors that can pose threat to their lives . <\s>
<s> So , if cars give off too much pollutants to the environment people are living in , people will try to find a substitute for cars in future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , people are becoming more concerned about their health and the environment around them than they used to be in the past . <\s>
<s> Now , after having put lots of damages to the environment , people are trying to conserve the environment again and trying to find a way to get rid of the pollutions they have created . <\s>
<s> That 's why people are trying to use more environmental friendly method of transportations and use public transportations to reduce the pollution going on . <\s>
<s> If this trend continues on , in twenty years time , less people will use cars as their main source of transportation and try to find another solution and use less cars in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , the reason why people use cars is to be more convenient when they are moving . <\s>
<s> Driving cars is more convenient than walking , running , or driving a horse . <\s>
<s> People have developed many ways to make these improvements during the past . <\s>
<s> Mankind have made an enormous development in the past history . <\s>
<s> As the time goes on and on , people will try to invent a new way of transportation which will make them more convenient and less time taking than now . <\s>
<s> Even now , airplane has been invented and is becoming more popular than it used to be in the past becuase it is less time consuming and more comfortable than a car . <\s>
<s> So , with regards to this characteristic of mankind , there is no reason why people will not invent a new method of transportation and abandon using cars as their main method of transportation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The aggressive nature of human beings , growing awareness of importance of natural environment , and development of technologies to meet people 's desires to live a more convenient and less time consuming life will probably reduce the numer of cars used in twenty years from now . <\s>
<s> People are always trying to make improvements in their lives . <\s>
<s> So , if they are more concerned with having a better life than they have now , they will try to find a way to do so under any circumstances . <\s>
<s> Although it is important to gain knowledge of many basic facts , I think that it is really better to acquire understanding of concepts and ideas which are given in lectures and classes . <\s>
<s> There are three reasons why I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first point I have to mention is that you can look up every fact which you want to know about in books or the Internet . <\s>
<s> In addition , this process does not take a lot of time . <\s>
<s> For example , when you are asking about a special date , you can use a history book or an Internet site which deals with historical dates . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , it is very helpful for your future profession when you have understand the concepts and ideas which are often used in the professional life . <\s>
<s> When a special problem occurs you have to solve it using your abilitites you have learned during your studying time . <\s>
<s> Think of an instance in mathematics . <\s>
<s> When you try to solve an equation to finish the calculations which are very important for your company it is absolutely necessary that you have understand the concept of solving such equations in order to avoid mistakes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To continue , there is still another reason for my opinion . <\s>
<s> When you are confident with the underlying principles of any topic you are , as a result , enabled to unterstand and , probably , to solve new problems . <\s>
<s> Imagine the case of a special problem which only emerges in your section . <\s>
<s> This problem has to be solved but no known way of approaching this problem is appropriate . <\s>
<s> So your combination abilities are very important . <\s>
<s> You have now to combine concepts and ideas you have already learned and the new . <\s>
<s> Consequently , when you have acquired a great variety of principles to solve problems you will probably be prepared well in creating own , new ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , from my perspective , it is better for students to gain knowledge of many concepts to be successful in their future professional life . <\s>
<s> The purpose of advertisements is to present a product or service in such a way that the consumers would want to have it , and have it immediately . <\s>
<s> Accordingly most advertisements would make the products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are thousands and thousands of products and services being promoted in advertisements . <\s>
<s> However not all commodities and services are needed by the consumers , at least not all of them . <\s>
<s> But advertisements will be presented in all media like newspaper , TV commercials , street signs as if it is for all mankind . <\s>
<s> All the advantages of a product are being highlighted , whereas nothing will be mentioned about the weaknesses , which definitely would exist . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , insurance company 's selling piont is the efficiency and complete service whenever there is a claim after a car accident . <\s>
<s> But in reality , there are always complicated paperwork to complete and a long process for the claim to be approved . <\s>
<s> Sometimes a client has to go to different departments and doctors ' offices to get verification . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The promotion of a soft-drink will also emphasis how good it is to a thirsty person and meet needs for energy , etc. whereas how soon a person would get thirsty again and the side effect will not be mentioned at all . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some commercials will do comparision between one product with another brand . <\s>
<s> For instance , laundry powder that would clear stains of all kinds totally and quickly , whereas the type from another manufacturer will not do the same good job . <\s>
<s> But they would not let the consumers know exactly how the experiments was conducted . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many advertisements use famous people like sports figures , movie stars , singers , or young and attractive people to draw people 's attention . <\s>
<s> These commercials give the false impression that once the products are being used , the consumers will become like those in the ad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Manufacturers should be truthful in promoting their products and government should impose regulations and policies to protect consumers . <\s>
<s> With the fast mode of life style , young people tend to be more reluctant to care about the community . <\s>
<s> They need to accomplish many tasks within a limited available time . <\s>
<s> They actually face pressures every where . <\s>
<s> Very little time is spared to look after others . <\s>
<s> Education , on one part consumes a quite large part of their typical day . <\s>
<s> Hense , they try to fill the other free time by enjoying themselves and spending the other in different hobbies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advance of technology that has once made the youths ' lives extremely easier and more comfortable , adds further pressure on them to accomplish as much varied jobs as possible at a time . <\s>
<s> They find themselves divided up between various undelayable tasks . <\s>
<s> The result is an abandant package of responsibilties and a short limited available time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is also an important factor that should be considered other than free time in order to do voluntary jobs . <\s>
<s> It is the financial assistance that youth need . <\s>
<s> Most of the youth nowadays , rely on their own to support themselves to make living . <\s>
<s> Thery have to work hard to do this . <\s>
<s> Not all parents do care for their living needs . <\s>
<s> Educational fees require them tp provide the necessary financial ability to go to college or higher studies . <\s>
<s> Not all families support their sons / daughter with educational expenses . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the youth have been surrounded by a great deal of attractions , starting from the around - the - clock access to the internet to the newley invented innovations of technological products that take most of the vailable time of youth . <\s>
<s> Very little time is then left to be utilized in any voluntary actitivty . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The social values are have also changed tremendousluy . <\s>
<s> People are becoming mainly inclined to indiviualism . <\s>
<s> So ego centrism replaces values of enphlathropics . <\s>
<s> finally , youth should work very hard to secure their future carees that compell them to show high qualifications and competency . <\s>
<s> There is a prediction that car usage will decline in the future for several reasons . <\s>
<s> Firstly , it is getting expensive to own and use a car . <\s>
<s> Scarcity has driven the prices for oil and the raw materials for manufacturing of cars up to an almost unacceptable level . <\s>
<s> Also , car usage adds onto the already serious air pollution and global warming problems with their exhaust . <\s>
<s> The economical and environmental reasons encourage people to switch to a cheaper and cleaner mode of transportation - the mass transportation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I believe that there will not be significantly fewer cars in use twenty years from now on . <\s>
<s> Firstly , with the rise of many third world countries such as China and India , many more individuals will be able to replace their cheaper vehecles , such as bicycles and motorcycles , with cars . <\s>
<s> Not only because of the luxury , they will be able to travel to further places more frequently . <\s>
<s> Economic advancements also encourage researches on greener energy . <\s>
<s> In the future , cars with inbuilt solar panels may become the major vehicles on the road . <\s>
<s> Besides using solar energy , a greener way of travelling can also be achieved with reduction in car sizes . <\s>
<s> There may be options varying from one seat personal cars to six seats family mini vans . <\s>
<s> The lack of metals for car manufacturing can also be solved with technology . <\s>
<s> Researches on strong materials such as carbon nanotubes may serve to replace today 's steel sheets . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars , just as many other items we have in modern lifestyle , provides us with tremendous convenience . <\s>
<s> Yet , they bring about problems that may one day lower our quality of life . <\s>
<s> However , instead of escaping , we should confront the problems with better solutions . <\s>
<s> Hence , there will be more cars instead of fewer , just greener and smaller , twenty years later . <\s>
<s> Most advertisements seem to make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Most advertisement seems to emphasize too much of their benefits or vital points in their products . <\s>
<s> To make the advertisements more effective , people work for the advertisements use more color , put overstatements about the products in good way , and use popular actors , actresses , and even singers to make the effects bigger . <\s>
<s> In general , customers should not believe in too much for the advertisements itself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I have two examples to show how the way advertisements work . <\s>
<s> One is that the advertisement of CAMEL cigarette , there are actually two advertisements paper for men and women . <\s>
<s> But the common point is that there is a man and woman who look beautiful and look cool with the cigarette on its both advertisement . <\s>
<s> The advertisements want consumers to think to be looked cool or even mature when they smoke like the model on its advertisements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The other example is about nutrition pills . <\s>
<s> There are many kinds of pills or powders such as diet pill , protein powder , Omega 6 pills , etc and its advertisement affects people greatly . <\s>
<s> Those advertisement make people think their body look not nice even if they really do not , and let them buy those pills to loose weight or make mascle . <\s>
<s> Some people might believe if they take big amount of protein powder , they would make huge muscle which they want . <\s>
<s> However , the truth is they cannot . <\s>
<s> Those protein powder does not help to make more muscle . <\s>
<s> People who buy the protein power are just waisting their money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People can buy anything they want in this society . <\s>
<s> However , many of them do not realize how they are affected by those advertisement when they go shopping and choose things to buy . <\s>
<s> Customers have to know only what they really need to buy , but not for the products they think atractive because of its advertisement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Be a smart shopper . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement proposed , here is why . <\s>
<s> Education has walked a long way to become what it is today . <\s>
<s> Take your father 's class and you will be confronted by a `` memory rules '' approach . <\s>
<s> Everything has changed and the place of the memory is one of the biggest victim of this evolution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> `` Learning facts '' has the fatal flaw of beign associated with memory , otherwise , how you will remember a date , an event or the name of one president ? . <\s>
<s> A fact is just a tale of something that happend . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The last couple of years saw an increase in education research . <\s>
<s> tens of theories has been proposed and in some cases , has been tested . <\s>
<s> One has emerged as the current champion : Constructivity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Constructivity means that everything we are going to learn has to be builted on the shoulders of something we already know . <\s>
<s> That way , we are not dealing with a million of separate facts to remember but with a few knowladge networks that will activate a couple of related ideas every single time we touch one of the ideas belonging to the same network . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What 's the magic of these ? , that studies had proved that we have three tipes of memory , a short-term , a mid-term and a long term one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Short term allow us to dig a lot of information but to lose it fast , medium will let us remember that we have touched the subject , but the details will be gone . <\s>
<s> Long term memory is composed of all the things that impact us in a unusual way or the things we use every day . <\s>
<s> Constructivity tries to place our knowladge in the medium and large-term area by changing the frecuency of use . <\s>
<s> A very common question posed by students revolves around what it is better , either having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject ? <\s>
<s> Grounds can be held to support any of the two possible answers . <\s>
<s> In fact , both have advantages and disadvantages , but as far as I am concerned , to specialize in a single field seems to be the right answer . <\s>
<s> I will give three reasons to back up my choice . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First af all , it seems undeniable that nowadays the labor market is demanding for very young and capable employees , usually already holding a Master 's degree . <\s>
<s> Neither this young people nor the educational system can disregard this fact , and the Universities must encourage their students to specialize and focus specifically on certain and well-defined subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , we have to put special emphasis in the fact that recent psychological researches are showing that acquiring expertise on a specific field of knowledge , is a way for people to feel fully happy with themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A third point refers to the fact that studying a subject seriously and at great length takes a great deal of time , and makes it very difficult to deep in any other subjects . <\s>
<s> We do not want our students to become second-rate proffessionals in their careers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , given the current expectations on the entrepreneurs ' part and thus , in the labor market , it is important for society in general and for academia in particular facing up to reality and encourage the students to follow the right direction : specialization . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , arguments holding the other way round , that is , the importance of acquire a broad knowledge of many academic subjects cannot be completely swept aside either . <\s>
<s> In my book , well-educated people need to have a very high level of acquaintance of a certain field ( law , science , literature , etc. ) , but at the same time , it is very satisfactory to devote some time to different activities ( cultural activities , sports , and so forth and so on ) . <\s>
<s> New York City , 2026 . <\s>
<s> For a time-traveler from today , the city is hardly recognizable , for one main reason : cars have almost disappeared . <\s>
<s> Where are all the yellow cabs , the traffic jams and the continuous flows of cars ? <\s>
<s> Instead , there are electrical buses , and a few fuel cell cars , that only the richest can afford . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Is this assumption realistic ? <\s>
<s> In other words , will there be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today ? <\s>
<s> In order to answe this question , I will evaluate the different factors that play a role in this issue . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As we all know , oil and natural gas resources are doomed to be over by 50 or 60 years . <\s>
<s> In the meantime , their price will continue rising as it already does . <\s>
<s> This leads to assume that cars are going to become a luxury that fewer people will afford , and hence that the number of cars will decrease . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , global warming is now being faced as a real issue for our planet , and fuel consumption by cars largely contributes to it . <\s>
<s> Some governments are already raising taxes on gas , in order to make people reduce their use of cars . <\s>
<s> They also encourage public transport : 30 people in a bus represent a much smaller impact on environment than 30 people in their own cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , oil price rises and global warming are also faced with a more innovative approach . <\s>
<s> Technologies are being developed which will allow cars to be cleaner for the environment . <\s>
<s> Hybrid engines , cell fuels , electric engines , are probably what the future of cars is made of . <\s>
<s> As soon as the price of these technologies becomes effective and competitive compared to oil , we may expect a rise in the use of such cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The remaining questions are mainly when this shift will happen , and whether the price of a car will be affordable . <\s>
<s> I think we may first expect an overall slow decrease of the number of cars in the next thirty years , followed by a rebound . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Maybe by that time our behaviour will have changed , public transport will have spread widely , and the rebound will not occur so much . <\s>
<s> But owning a car is - and will always be - a pride and a feature of independence , which leads me to assume that cars have a bright future . <\s>
<s> There are different opinions about what is best method in order to prepare students . <\s>
<s> According to me they could be associated to the school systems of two countries , Italy and the United States . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people sustain that it is more important for students to have a theorical preparation based on ideas and concepts , than a pratical preparation based on facts . <\s>
<s> A reasons in favour of that opinion could be that a student has to learn the techniques of a job before practising the job itself . <\s>
<s> Another reason could be that with a theorical preparation a student will always be able to learn and develope by himself new concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> On the contrary other people affirms that it 's more valuable for a student 's career to practise activities ( such as stages , trainings etc ) instead of reading them just theorically . <\s>
<s> In fact in many situations students study at school a lot of things that seem to not be useful at all when they go to work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion learning facts is the best way to prepare a student for his future job , especially when he is at university . <\s>
<s> For example I disagree with the Italian university system that obliges students to study books of thousands of pages instead of providing them with some real work experiences . <\s>
<s> I think in this way students would forget almost half of the information they study just the day after they took the exam . <\s>
<s> In addition , when they will have to look for a job , farms often say they lack of experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently I prefer the American university system , where students have less to study but they do activities that make them become familiar with their future job . <\s>
<s> However I have to say that in some cases theorical preparation is important , for example in order to provide the student with a good general culture ; and in this way I think Italian university system is better than the American one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I believe that a student should have a very good preparation based on facts ; but it would be important for him to understand ideas and concepts in order to improve the techniques of his specifical job and also his personal culture . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is whether the young people today devote ample time in helping their community or not . <\s>
<s> The topic is very important because of it deals with the youth , who will decide , dominate and mould the future of the world . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I think that young people invest a lot of their time , energy and resourses in working for their respective communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first and formost reasons for believing so comes from my personal expericeince . <\s>
<s> I along with my friends regularly spend time in doing community service . <\s>
<s> This was a habbit inculcated by my parents long ago but i am proud to mention the fact that even now i stick to it , though no parental check is present now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Various surveys conducted by prominent NGO 's ( non government organizations ) have highlighted the fact that , that recent years have witnessed a steady increase in the number of young people and students who voluntarily come forward for doing community work . <\s>
<s> Since any kind of community service would also require a lot of physical activity apart from the obvious financial investments , it is but obvious that the youth should take the onus of this task . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Springing up of a large number of bodies , organizations and other institutes which work in the area of community service bear testimony to the fact the youth today has not shunned it 's social responsibilities . <\s>
<s> Infact coming across students who spent a mjor part of their summer breaks doing community service , has become more of a rule rather than an exception . <\s>
<s> Infact to encourage this trend further , now almost every professional organization as well as educational institutes allow their respective employees and students to carry on with their community work apart from their designated assignments . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the light of the above reasons i can confidently claim that young people today devote sufficent time in helping their respective communities <\s>
<s> Looking at the rapid increase in the science and technology i feel that there would be certainly much more cars on roads than there are today . <\s>
<s> Automobile industry forms a big part of the Gross Domestic Product for any country . <\s>
<s> A reduction in the production of cars wich are the main component of the automobile industry means a dwindle in the Gross Domestic Product which can be a huge loss to the nation 's per capita income . <\s>
<s> No country would ever risk upon its economy and living standards of its citizens . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars reduce the distances that seem to be far off by public transport . <\s>
<s> With internet , telephones , radios and all other means of communications and facilties such as a small pantry and air conditioners being available in today 's cars travelling by a car is much more comfortable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The multinational companies attract the unemployed by providing perks and facilities which include providing them with cars for transport . <\s>
<s> Since most of the multinational companies are mass recruiters so a mass recruitment every session means a huge increase in the number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars are used to provude cab facilities to people who cannot own one and these cabs are particularly helpful to the tourists or people who are new to a place and are not aware about the means to commute . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Almost all the countries have specially assigned cars for their government officials . <\s>
<s> With the increase in the population and the consequent increase in the government officials governing these people the increase in the number of cars is certain . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With the innovation and new scientific research being carried out everyday new cars are being developed that offer a higher mileage at much cheaper maintanance costs . <\s>
<s> They are definitely better than relying on publictransport which is not really convenient at all times . <\s>
<s> Owning a car means you can move to any place at anytime along with your family so people would definitely prefer going in for the better cars that are introduced into the market everyday . <\s>
<s> Owning a car has become a standard for some people that consider it to reflect their lifestyle so they will definitely prefer buying cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The people todat are much more intelligent than ever before they are earning handsome amount of money and want to flaunt with the best of cars and the most modern ones with the latest technology . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Personally i would say that i would rather going by a car instead of the public transport . <\s>
<s> Not only will it more convenient to reach my destinations on time it will simultaneously provide all the facilities on my toes . <\s>
<s> With the introduction of mass medias into modern societies , advertisement has developed a new , important role in modern life . <\s>
<s> As it became important , it also had to develop new ways of attracting people , becoming more and more similar to a work of art than to a businnes-related expedient . <\s>
<s> One of these new ways was to present the product in the best possible way , in order to attract more people to it . <\s>
<s> Some companies during this process have also made the decision to lie about the real characteristics of their product . <\s>
<s> Personally I do n't consider this part of the game , eventhough sometimes it can be really annoying . <\s>
<s> Advertisements are supposed to show a product in the best way , and I can understand if a company decides to hide the bad characteristic of the product in order to make it more attractive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But I really ca n't accept when advertisements boast about something that is not true . <\s>
<s> I 'm not talking about children 's toy advertisements , where products are shown in a `` fantastic '' way in order to attract the children . <\s>
<s> I can understand that in this case we are talking about a product that is in some ways related to the child 's fantasy , and the adults who are supposed to buy it are well aware of the fact that the toy will not , for example , fly , as it is shown in the ad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I 'm talking about advertisements that are directed to an adult audience and lie about the real characteristics and possibilities of the product . <\s>
<s> This is in my opinion a real fraud and these ads should n't be allowed to be broadcasted or printed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Fortunately in these days , new laws about this problem have been created and hopefully advertisement companies will not make a fool of us anymore . <\s>
<s> The world is in permanent change and evolution therefore we should follow this evoluion in order to improve our life and knowledge . <\s>
<s> So there are some people who try new things and take risks rather than keeping the old methods even if they know very well how to use it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Personally i like to be different from the others , so i use all the time new techniques and methods . <\s>
<s> This new way to do is very important because it could be a source of success . <\s>
<s> To illustrate more what i am saying i have an example ; last year i had my training at a small company exactly in the financial departement . <\s>
<s> What i discovered during my presence , at that firm , is that the financial staff does not use the technology in order to improve the quality of the work . <\s>
<s> They do not have a computer , imagine a company now in 2000s years and it does not have a computer . <\s>
<s> This causes a lot of problems to the company especially in analysing the daily situation of the company . <\s>
<s> so what i did is that i talked to my boss in order to buy some computers because they will improve the work and he will need less people . <\s>
<s> after a very long discussion he accepted to buy just one computer at the begining in order to test what i said . <\s>
<s> after one week he told me that his staff is very satisfied and they have now more time to do other important things rather then calculating some small operations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> but if you decide to work with news things you should accept to take risks but i think that is a very logical result . <\s>
<s> because you will use new methods and maybe new procedures that are not all the time good . <\s>
<s> so to solve this problem , i think that rsiks represent a part of our life especially if you decided to try things differently . <\s>
<s> but you should remember that when you take a lot risks you will win more . <\s>
<s> to illustrate that , i will tell you an example based especially on my life as a would a bussiness woman . <\s>
<s> when i invest more money at any project automatically i think about the risk that i run . <\s>
<s> because it will be as hudge as the imprtance of the money i invetsed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> so to sum up i want to say that i agree with the statement simply because new methods and risks are a part of my professionnel life . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , young people have the chance to enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> First of all , I am convinced that young people have more opportunities than older people do . <\s>
<s> Indeed , they have all the possibilities in front of them . <\s>
<s> As they have no real responsabilities , young people can do what they want without thinking about their children or their job . <\s>
<s> Moreover , we can denied that young people have a good health . <\s>
<s> So , they can travel a lot , discovering new country , doing lots of sport . <\s>
<s> Hence some old people can travel but they have to face to their physical limits . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The social life of most of students is particularly developed and active . <\s>
<s> I have the feeling that young people meet friends everywhere and everytime . <\s>
<s> The lectures offer the opportunity to see friends everyday . <\s>
<s> Even if their family matters , they have the opportunity to live their roots to enjoy new experiences . <\s>
<s> They have no fundamental obligations . <\s>
<s> I am myself o good example of a free joung woman . <\s>
<s> In fact , I have recently decided to live my parents in order to do an internship in a big company in Paris . <\s>
<s> I have two roomates with which I share lots of things and we have the project to go to Australia next summer to find a job as a waitress and improve our English . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , I think that young people have less doubts and are less disappointed by the life . <\s>
<s> In fact , I believe that some experiences could affect you and change your frame of mind . <\s>
<s> I have often remark this phenomenon for the old people . <\s>
<s> Sometimes the lost of their friends or a member of their family could make them sad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Given all of these points , I am really convinced that beeing young is a chance and offers a large range of opportunities . <\s>
<s> Advertising is the art of encourage a customer to buy a product instead of another one having the same qualities . <\s>
<s> Therefore , it should not be surprising at all that , sometimes , advertisements can make a product seems much better than it really is . <\s>
<s> Toys , snacks and mobile phone services are three kind of products that are not usually as good as you may think after having seen their advertisements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last year , I decided to buy a new mobile phone , and so I also had to change my service provider . <\s>
<s> Since I did n't have enough time to compare all the offers available on the market , I decided to make my decision just looking at the advertisements . <\s>
<s> I choosed a provider that offered one hundred minutes of free calls every month . <\s>
<s> One month later , when the first bill arrived , I discovered that this offer was valid for international calls only , and not for national ones . <\s>
<s> For sure , I did n't get what I paid for . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When I was a kid , I once asked my parents to buy for me a new bike . <\s>
<s> I did n't want a traditional bike , but a BMX , which was the most popular model at that time , mainly due to a big advertising campain on TV and newspaper . <\s>
<s> The result ? <\s>
<s> My parents bought that bike , which , by the way , was also really expensive , and it got broken after just three weeks . <\s>
<s> It seemed literally unbreakable on TV ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is not a big difference from one snack to another . <\s>
<s> If someone gives you an hamburger , I bet that you wo n't be able to tell in which fast food it has been purchased . <\s>
<s> Indeed , advertisements can make a snack seems better than another one . <\s>
<s> For example , you may think that , since a beverage has been promoted by a celebrity , it is better than a less famous one . <\s>
<s> The truth , however , is that they are practically equal , and that , if a difference exists , it is almost unnoticeable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Products are not always as good as advertisements may suggest . <\s>
<s> I had bad experiences in my life when I had to purchase a product , and now I do n't trust in advertisements anymore . <\s>
<s> When I need to buy a new object , I ask for suggestions to someone who has already bought it , or I just wait for a few months . <\s>
<s> Time only will tell me if a certain product worths its price or not . <\s>
<s> Cars are the main contemporary transport devices that are widely used by people today . <\s>
<s> However , although there are a vast number of cars in our world , I think that they will start to decrease in a few decades . <\s>
<s> I believe that in twenty years , by the decrease in the amount of petroleum , and by technological improvements that will enable us to travel longer distances in cheaper costs , the number of cars will decrease dramatically . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Petroleum is the main natural resource that is used as the fuel for cars . <\s>
<s> However , because of the huge consumption of this natural resource , it was greatly reduced . <\s>
<s> After twenty years , the petroleum that is left will not fulfill the needs of overpopulated people in cities . <\s>
<s> Because of that , petroleum prices will be much higher , and the people will have to think twice before purchasing a car . <\s>
<s> For example , because the gas prices are more than people can afford in Turkey , people prefer travelling short distances by foot , and large distances by busses , which are considerably cheaper than using owned cars . <\s>
<s> Because of that , the number of cars decreased considerably . <\s>
<s> Therefore , because petroleum is a natural resource that is decreasing constantly , in twenty years , people will use other ways to travel , instead of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , thanks to the technological improvements , new transportation devices , which are more convinient , are used . <\s>
<s> Years after years , devices that enable quicker mass transportation have been made . <\s>
<s> For example , the usage of the underground travel system , namely metro , has increased in all around England . <\s>
<s> Because of the traffic caused by the high population of cars , metros superceded cars in England . <\s>
<s> In twenty years , this new method of travelling will be widespread in the entire world , and , as a result , there will be fewer cars used for travelling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , I believe that , in twenty years , by the increasing technological advances in transportation , cars will not be used anymore , as they are used today . <\s>
<s> Because of unique inventions and the depletion of the natural resource of petroleum , healthier and more convinient devices will be invented for the benefit of human beings . <\s>
<s> As the years pass by , many universities , schools and other institutions are trying to teach the future generations and provide them with the wide variety of sciences which make them ready for the future challenges . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The question that always rises in these institutions is whether it is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts or to learn the hard facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my personal opinion , i think it is more important for the students to understand the main concepts of the subjects than to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As for a student to learn a fact , all he has to do is to memorise it . <\s>
<s> Memorising something without understanding it will lead to forgetting this fact as soon as _or shortly after _ the stimulus for memorising it is over . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Facts are only memorised and stored in the long term memory if they are constantly used in everyday life . <\s>
<s> For example when a medical student has to memorise all different types of drugs . <\s>
<s> If this student was n't asked about these drugs in every morning rounds , where he had to revise them everytime he made a mistake , he would otherwise forget them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , understanding the subject makes it easier to remember . <\s>
<s> For example when the same medical student has to memorise some information about the physiology of the human body . <\s>
<s> he can understand it once , and answer any questions related to this topic years after he had studied it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is why i prefer understanding the topic over learning the facts . <\s>
<s> As the facts are easily lost over the years and what remains is what we understand of that particular subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Understanding the ideas and concepts requires far more work and processing by the student than only memorising the facts . <\s>
<s> So it is always up to the student at the end to choose between understanding and memorising . <\s>
<s> I Disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> I BELIEVE THAT IT IS BETTER TO SPECIALIZE IN AN AREA THAT TO BE FAMILIAR TO A WHOLE LOT OF ACADEMIC SUBJECTS . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My response is based on an experience that speeks for itself . <\s>
<s> Being from an engineering background i was faced with a similar situation where i needed to choose between a spealized course of INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ( IT ) and a general stream of computer science which also includes IT . <\s>
<s> I would rather be good at one thing than know about a wide range of areas . <\s>
<s> So I took IT . <\s>
<s> Now i can proudly say that I specialize in IT n get a brilliant job rather than saying that I know about many areas n settle for an average job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Similar case where doctors after doing MBBS have to specilize in a stream to be successful . <\s>
<s> Suppose a person is just MBBS . <\s>
<s> He knows about every part of the body but doesnot know how to handle a patient who urgently needs a heart surgery . <\s>
<s> This again puts light on the topic where specializing counts a lot . <\s>
<s> In this specific case it could mean life or death for the patient . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When a person is good at a certain area he/she can persue a career in that stream . <\s>
<s> Everyone has likes and dislikes for subjects . <\s>
<s> No one can say that he/she likes all areas of the academic curriculum . <\s>
<s> Thus the person must persue the area which they are most interested in and specialize in it . <\s>
<s> This will not only make him/her happy but also keep others happy . <\s>
<s> And the person is most likely to do well by studying something they are keen on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand the person who is jack of all trades is most likely to be unhappy n make people around him unhappy by not being good at what he/she is doing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus we can clearly conclude that it is better to specialize than to have broad knowledge about academic subjects . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Many youngsters today volunteeer at hospitals , old age homes , or participate in animal care centers and nature clubs . <\s>
<s> Young people surely care enough about the community to help out , for the simple reason that they also belong to this community and are proud of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many people have a general impression that young people just do n't care about their community especially in the present day . <\s>
<s> On the contrary , many young people are aware of the various problems faced by the community . <\s>
<s> There are a variety of ares where you find the young taking part . <\s>
<s> Many students help out in hospitals where they are required to do simple things but which make a world of difference to the patients . <\s>
<s> It shows them that some one cares . <\s>
<s> Students join nature clubs or animal protection clubs . <\s>
<s> Such groups always conduct activities which benifit the community in some form or other llike building trees or caring for injured or homeless animals . <\s>
<s> The young also join communities which help take care of orphanages . <\s>
<s> A lot of youngsters visit old age homes and spend time with the foks there . <\s>
<s> Sometimes rallies are held for the betterment of a certain cause in the society . <\s>
<s> This could also be thought of as a form of helping out the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most young peole do care about their community and help out whenever they have spare time . <\s>
<s> This is because they are introduced to the problems faced by the community early in their life . <\s>
<s> In the present day , the young have a lot more responsibilities to give back to the community . <\s>
<s> It is very important for young people to think about the community and come up with solutions to help the problems faced by the community . <\s>
<s> The young will always help out in the problems faced by the community as they are the future of that community . <\s>
<s> I gree with the statement that people who try new things and take risks usually turn successful than those who only do what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I believe creativeness is one of the most fundamental essences for human inventions . <\s>
<s> All valuable inventions in the past happened because people then were creative in responding to specific difficulties or needs of the situation . <\s>
<s> Without creativeness , one needs to abide by the negative conditions or hardship . <\s>
<s> I strongly believe one can learn greatly from failures as well and taking risks will eventually bring the person a profit in the long run . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people may argue that some traditional cultures are better preserved as they are , and I agree with this opinion in principle . <\s>
<s> However , preserving the culture can take different ways than just leaving them unchanged or untouched . <\s>
<s> For example , it is often reported that the traditional craftmanship is at danger of being lost because of the change in people 's lifestyle . <\s>
<s> In such cases , the tradition can be preserved by adopting its style to the modern ways , still using the accumulated knowledge or skills to make that happen . <\s>
<s> Without such challenges , that specific tradition may be at more risk of extinction than taking up a creative change . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclustion , I stronfly believe that being creative and ready to take risks is a very important factor for people to be successful , and hope I will be so in the face of upcoming challenges that I may encounter by studying abroad . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Young people of this generation do not spare enough time helping their communities . <\s>
<s> There are various reasons for this . <\s>
<s> Firstly , Youngsters of todays world are more inclined towards planning their career . <\s>
<s> It has become important for them to make a goal and thrive hard to accomplish it . <\s>
<s> They are of general belief that they have many other works to accomplish than working for community . <\s>
<s> They rarely spare time for the community . <\s>
<s> Earlier days , as we hear from our grand parents , they used to form welfare communities and work hard for it . <\s>
<s> scheduling meetings , attended by all youngsters in community and planning things for the betterment of community . <\s>
<s> This characteristic virtually lacks in youngsters of today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , the other reason might as well be lack of initiation . <\s>
<s> the youngsters should be motivated to start programmes that help communities to grow and prosper . <\s>
<s> if one takes a step towards helping community , their friends , neigbours will join them too . <\s>
<s> Youngsters in colleges , universities and those working in corporates , prefer enjoying their weekends rather doing supportive work . <\s>
<s> i feel they should instead think of creative ideas that would improve quality of living in community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , youngsters to be helpfull for community , the qualities should be inculcated when they are in growing stages . <\s>
<s> As the saying goes `` old habits die hard '' . <\s>
<s> Helping community , working for it shuld be thought to individuals at a very early stage of life ( proabably from the age of 6 ) , by doing so they grow up to be helpful individuals . <\s>
<s> Consider an example , Ashoka , Indian Emporer planted trees by roads , helped the needy , and eventually became a leader . <\s>
<s> The helpful nature helped him to be a leader . <\s>
<s> History says these qualities were embibed in him by his mother when he was a kid . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The reasons for the youngsters not working towards the community are that they are more career oriented . <\s>
<s> they concentrate more on their future . <\s>
<s> parents also play a important role in behaviour of younsters . <\s>
<s> parents ought make their children understand the importance of society and need to help the communities . <\s>
<s> they should encourage children to participate in communities more often . <\s>
<s> The concept of gaining knowledge is an age old process dating back to centuries . <\s>
<s> In those times especially in ancient India , the teachers taught not only in a particular subject but wanted the students to have a broader knowledge in more than one subject . <\s>
<s> This as those people believed to be mainly because knowledge is derived only to make a better person altogether . <\s>
<s> This is attained by improving the wisdom that a person holds afteer gaining the over all broader knowledge . <\s>
<s> This wisdom helps the person to be a good human being . <\s>
<s> This kind of concept is still the main thing that is followed through out the world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my view i can say that gaining a broad knowledge on many subjects is far more important than gaining the specialized knowledge on one particular subject . <\s>
<s> If any person has a broader concept on many academic subjects , then he is sure of applying . <\s>
<s> For instance if a person has mastered in computers and doesnt know where to use it and what kind of programs to be made , then all his specialization would be a mere waste of time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Quoting another example when a person who is say Engineer by occupation , sees a person who is collapsing on the road with a breathing problem , all that he can do is to call an ambulance but if he has any kind of knowledge on how to do a first aid to that kind of a person , then nay be he can really save the life of that dying person . <\s>
<s> This is the way the knowledge comes in handy . <\s>
<s> You never know when youm need them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another illustration that can be given in this context is that when a person is jobless for quite a long time , then he can go and do a job if he has a knowledge on other subjects too . <\s>
<s> If a doctor is jobless say after he finished his internship , then if he has a knowledge in computers he can find a job in that field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus having greater knowledge on subjects sometimes saves lives or some times earns you money and make your living . <\s>
<s> So it is always best to have it fir a better life and a good settlement . <\s>
<s> Today , gaining braodband information gains more anf more importance with the development of science and technology , Basically , the academic environment is the one who follows the technology more closely than the other institutions and companies . <\s>
<s> It can be easily stated that the people who want to be involved in so much information should be in the acdemic environment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The people who invented new things that changed our lives had come from the academic envirenment . <\s>
<s> For instace , take a look into the history of science and technology . <\s>
<s> You will confront with Einsteins , Pasteurs and etc . <\s>
<s> The common thing in all these people is that these people come from academics . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> If you again take a look at the history , you can easily see that the inventions had been made by people who can combine their knowledges from different areas . <\s>
<s> For instance , did you know Einstein was working as a patent officer before he came up with the famous relativity theory . <\s>
<s> This fact should not be a surprise for anyone because he was reading lots of patent documents during his work in patent office . <\s>
<s> He combined these subjects that he had gained from patents and his academic experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is also good to be an expert in one academic area but the person , who builds his academic carrer in this way , is generally limited with the information in one area . <\s>
<s> The good thing is that he knows all the details of informaton in one area with an enormous depth but it generally requires to have intemediate level of informaton in all academic areas to come up with innovative ideas . <\s>
<s> These people who have information in all areas take information from the experts in specific areas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that it is generally better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> The history of innovation is full of people with intermediate level of information from all academic areas . <\s>
<s> Think again if a person can go much further in general if he is an expert of only a small academic subject . <\s>
<s> It has been commonly said that successful people do not do things differently but they just think differently . <\s>
<s> Successful people generally have the tendency of taking risks in situations . <\s>
<s> Sucessful people generally have the knowledge and expertise apart from that they try and deal situations in a different manner . <\s>
<s> Let us take the examples of corporate leaders like Bill gates or Warren Buffet , who have been so successful in the corporate world . <\s>
<s> Both of these men have dealed with situations in an unconventional manner and the results are with everyone to see . <\s>
<s> Bill Gates explored new territories of computer software which made the Microsoft so famous . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For a person to be successful in the world certain qualities like leadership , business acumen , creativity and knowledge are very important . <\s>
<s> Successful people along with these qualities have risk taking ability . <\s>
<s> They generally take risks and try new things which makes them apart from the rest of the human herd . <\s>
<s> New innovations in science is another example of what humans can achieve if they keep on trying with different things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The idea of gravitation which was given by Newton was because he thought differently from the rest of the people as every one in his time saw the apple falling from the trees . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To try out new things is very important and it is the quality which is inherent in most of the successful people . <\s>
<s> The successful people generally take failures in their stride . <\s>
<s> Edison who invented the bulb had to face so many time failures yet he persisted with the idea of making the bulb and ultimately was able to accomplish his goal . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people generally along with their hard work and perseverance try and accomplish waht noone has achieved till now . <\s>
<s> So i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing only what they know . <\s>
<s> Is it better to travel with a tour ? <\s>
<s> I would have certainly answered yes to this question a long time ago , however I changed my mind completely . <\s>
<s> It all started five years ago when I organized a trip to Europe with my best friend . <\s>
<s> First of all I 'll write about the disadvantages from my own point of view , and later on I will expose the advantages of a guide while you are travelling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When travelling with a tour guide you have almost everything controlled , even the timing for the bathroom . <\s>
<s> Are those really vacations ? <\s>
<s> Certainly it is easier if you do n't know the place you are visiting and your are not a risk taker person . <\s>
<s> He or she will take you to the most important sights of the place you are visiting , but if you really liked a place , such as a little town , a museum or plaza , you wo n't be able to take your time and stay there . <\s>
<s> A bus will be waiting for you , with people in it , also waiting for you . <\s>
<s> What if you want to go back and buy that souvenir you left for the end of the visit ? <\s>
<s> Well you are not going back because there is a schedule to respect in order to comply with it . <\s>
<s> I gues that the worst part of travelling with a tour is the group . <\s>
<s> You might be lucky and be part of a very fun group where all of the people has more less the same interests . <\s>
<s> But , what happens if you are the younguest one in a tour where almost everybody is in their 60's ! <\s>
<s> That obviously will not be fun , or everyone is travelling in couples and you are alone , it will be more complicated to make friends and hang out during the day . <\s>
<s> Another complicated thing about tours is that generally , they stop in the most important places to visit , and there might also be magical little towns and spots that are worth visiting . <\s>
<s> A tour is going to give you the general idea of the country you are visiting , it will not take you to the local places where local people go . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other hand , travelling with a group can also be fun and can give solution to a lot of small planning problems that can be presented when less expected . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , when you are travelling by yourself you do n't spend too much time to eat , and a tour is contemplating that time , specially during breakfast . <\s>
<s> Also a tour is going to keep you very well informed about historic passages and data that is always useful to know . <\s>
<s> Addtionally , there will always be someone that can communicate with locals if you do n't speak their language . <\s>
<s> If you are a precautious person , you will make some research about the people that will be also travelling with you , because they are going to be your family during your stay . <\s>
<s> It will surely be fun if you take a trip with a tour where all of the tourists are your age . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Travelling in a tour led by a guide can always be fun if you keep in mind that you are not going to have complete control of the situation . <\s>
<s> Maybe it 's the best option if your are travelling to a very different country like China or Russia . <\s>
<s> However , it is always fun to be adventurous and explore new things by yourself . <\s>
<s> Always make a deep research of the place you are visiting in order to avoid further complications . <\s>
<s> I certainly think that making a trip with or without a tourist guide is always fun , it all depens on how well you want to spend your time and the disposition you have to make fiends and have fun . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with this statement because many were those who were the victims of t.v ads , in advertsements the only intrest of the advertiser is to promote an object , an idea or a newly launched product not caring whether it might affect the consumer in a positive or negative way or if it was a product intended for internal , use if it might cause any bodily damage . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ads are the best way also to increase the sales of a product so overall it is mainly to increase sales and thereby profit . <\s>
<s> For example i have seen many ads on tv promoting for weight loss pills , or even shorts that when worn during exersice increases prespiration . <\s>
<s> Some weight loss pills are FDA approved others arent which might cause severe drug - drug interaction or even food-drug interaction resulting in severe damage to health . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As for the shorts if not washed frequently , might also cause severe skin conditions . <\s>
<s> Other things like topical creams that when applied can redeuse 1 or 2 or 4 inches from the waist or hips as stated by the ad can just make people more lazy , by believing the ad they buy it and use it then sit around the whole day snaking and watching tv thinking that a miracle will happen . <\s>
<s> When the results are negative they just loose hope and look for another product or quit trying altogether . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other products include skin care products that make wrinkles disappear , they have the same harm if they are not approved and if they are not being officially sold in pharmacies . <\s>
<s> There are also ads promoting for long vacations in some luxurious resort , the idea may be appealing but on arrival there might be lack of facilities and some problems that were not specified in the ad which might make the holiday tiresome . <\s>
<s> Young people can enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> These days , youngsters have more opportunities to experience new things than old people . <\s>
<s> There are three crucial reasons why youngsters can enjoy life more . <\s>
<s> Having healthy body can experience anything , living in developed life style , and living in a trend life style . <\s>
<s> These reasons can support the reason why it is young people who can enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , having healthy body can experience anything . <\s>
<s> These days , from the investigation , the average height of young people are almost ten centimeters higher than before . <\s>
<s> Also , it is easy to see that these people look for healthy food than older one 's . <\s>
<s> When the age is becoming older than around fifties , it is not easy to experience physical things . <\s>
<s> Therefore , youngsters in these days are being prepared for later life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second of all , modern people are living in viciously developed life style . <\s>
<s> Modern technology is developing every year amazingly . <\s>
<s> For examples , internet is one of them . <\s>
<s> The speed of downloading files had been increased hundreds times . <\s>
<s> Also , it is trends that having web pages that people can show their interest and find their hobbies . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the modern style of searching their interests became really easy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third of all , living in a trend life style These days , the number of jobs had been increased by great amount . <\s>
<s> Nail styling , face sugering , internet business , and photo taking . <\s>
<s> These jobs can be one of the most popular jobs that exist in these days . <\s>
<s> Reasons why people look for unique job is that each person has different characteristics and suitable job . <\s>
<s> Therefore , eventhough they can not earn much money , they realize that doing the jobs which they can enjoy entire of thie lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it is young people who can enjoy life more than older people . <\s>
<s> People in these days have more chances to advanture new things . <\s>
<s> Having healthy body , living in developed life style , living in a unique life trend can cause the enjoyment . <\s>
<s> Maybe about thirty years later , youngsteres these days can l <\s>
<s> The issue here is which one will be better to have for academic knowledge , broad subjects or specialized in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> It is very complicated issue to choose one opinoin and to explain reasons to decide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I would have to say that both are important equally , and I may not say that wheather I agree or disagree the issue above . <\s>
<s> I might have to say that it perfectly depends upon the situation for undergraduate or graduate students . <\s>
<s> I would like to explain my own opnion that it is hard to choose one issue . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For college students , it is better to have wide range of knowledge in many academic fields . <\s>
<s> After graduation of high school , young college students are still are not legally grown up . <\s>
<s> However mentally , they are going to face and study for real knowledge for their life . <\s>
<s> I believe that most high school graduates have strong long-term goal for their own life , but they have never met advanced subjects before entering college . <\s>
<s> They should see various fields to choose the specific field for their own life . <\s>
<s> It really important chance for them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For deeper studies in graduate schools , students have to be specialist for their own field . <\s>
<s> They need to know further knowledge and to have deeper unerstanding on the field that they already have chosen during being college students before . <\s>
<s> As graduate students , they rather to study and focus on specific subject to have compatitiveness to go to the real world . <\s>
<s> Of cource some will not go out of boundary of university , but this kind of students also fosuc on specific subject to be a professer something like that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I agree that students must do both broad and specific academic knowledge . <\s>
<s> However I have to say that it is fully depends on their situation . <\s>
<s> One more thing that I would have to say is that students must have their unique and strong compatitiveness , selling point . <\s>
<s> To have this unique and strong compatitiveness , students have to think deeply to select what they really like and want to be . <\s>
<s> What ever we do , time goes on . <\s>
<s> Time is limited to everyone . <\s>
<s> Students , please do n't waste time . <\s>
<s> The world is yours . <\s>
<s> Be ambitious and be global leader . <\s>
<s> When learning a specific subject in school , students are required not only to know the information regarding the subject but also to understand the concepts implied . <\s>
<s> These two aspects are very differnt and require differnt abilities from students . <\s>
<s> Though it is important to know the facts for a subject , it is more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts in order to have a thourough understanding of the topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , simply memorizing facts does not imply knowing the topic . <\s>
<s> If a student does so , she is just regurgitating what she has read or heard which does n't mean she knows what she has learned . <\s>
<s> On the other hand if a studen understands the concepts and ideas related to the topic , then he understands the implications as well as the uses of the topic . <\s>
<s> For example in History , though it is often precieved as a subject which merely requires memorizing , a student needs to understand the concepts in order to full appreciate the subject . <\s>
<s> Merely memorizing dates and occurences does not offer real insight as to why certain events occur and what effects these events could have on our present society . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , understanding concepts as opposed to just learning facts allows a student to deal with any type of question . <\s>
<s> A student that has only learned facts will be expecting questions that ask him to answer with the facts he has learned . <\s>
<s> If a question deals with a deviation of these facts , then the student would not be able to adequatly ansewer the question . <\s>
<s> A student on the other hand , who understands the concepts implied would be able to use her procces of induction and deduction to come to logical answer . <\s>
<s> I , personaly , have come across such dilema in a physics test . <\s>
<s> The question I found on the test , dealt with a concept that we had not read or discussed previously in class . <\s>
<s> Fortunatly , I had a good understanding of the concepts and ideas involved wich allowed me to derive the appropriate formula that was required for the test . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , understanding concepts and ideas , allows a student to retain the subject and topic for a longer time . <\s>
<s> A student who memorizes facts is more likely to forget these once the test or examination is finished , so that the knowledge is thus not aquired . <\s>
<s> For a student who does understand the concepts , though she may forget the facts in the future , but she will still be able to think the process logicaly and come to a conclusion that would be adequate . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , only few people take risks . <\s>
<s> This happens because everybody to be sure that what they are doing will be successful . <\s>
<s> The problem with this approach is that if a person do n't take risk , the benefits are the same as the average . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One example of risk are sports , the mayority of persons that participate in an event , such a marathon , know how to train and what it should be done to finish the race ; but only some of them win the race , and these specific individuals usually not only win one competition but a lots . <\s>
<s> These ones are successful in reaching their goal not because they know what it was , but because they have trained to the limits of their body and went beyond them . <\s>
<s> This approach is the correct to success in life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This teach us that in order to success a person has to know what is the goal he wants to achieve . <\s>
<s> After that , this individual has to understand the path he has to follow to get this goal . <\s>
<s> Because a lot of people should be looking for this goal and following the same steps , it is important to stand out of the crowd . <\s>
<s> This is where innovation takes part of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Persons need to know that even if is well known paths all people advices you to follow , it is important to also know there are other unexplored roads to take . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my life I have experience some situations that have helped me to understand this , for example , I had the same job for about three years , and I was sure it was doing in right because I always did everything my boss told me to . <\s>
<s> I get a raise once but never was promoted , which was my goal . <\s>
<s> So , after three years I changed my attitude and start to participate more in the projects , I got involved more in my co-workers ' tasks and working more hours I they ask me to , after two months I was promoted . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it is important to take risks to stand of the crowd , if you do n't do it , you just have the average results everybody can get . <\s>
<s> In order to be successful a person has to know that hardwork pays . <\s>
<s> Some people think that enjoying life is connected to the age of the people . <\s>
<s> They think , that young people would enjoy their life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> But do n't you need the experience of having been both , young and old , to make any statement about this view in an appropiate way ? <\s>
<s> I do n't believe that this statement is true , I think how enjoyable your life is , depends on other factors . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I'am 26 years old and from my point of view , since I was a child , or the time since I 'm conscience of myself , I never enjoyed my life so much , like I do now . <\s>
<s> When I was a child , the only interesting things in my life , where toys and sweets and going to the holidays maybe . <\s>
<s> Maybe my life was easier , whithout the stress and depressing things of today , But their was nothing meaningful , special . <\s>
<s> I was not able to think in complex ways , did n't have any goals for my future , things that are of importance to me , like my university education , going abroad to study and so on . <\s>
<s> Maybe my life is more complex and difficult today , but I 'm conscies about things , that means I enjoy important events more conscies , I make decisions more conscies and that makes my life more valueable . <\s>
<s> That makes me independent and free . <\s>
<s> And this increased more and more during my life , my life is getting more and more serious , which also means better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore with getting older and `` wiser '' I also know better , which things in life are more or less important . <\s>
<s> In the last years I learned to appreciate the importance of my family . <\s>
<s> I did n't know that I really do need them to support me not only in a financial way , but also with their love , since a few years ago . <\s>
<s> In a special age like in the twenties you see your parents as your enemies , you have to get older , to be aware of their value and importance for your life , to let them love you and give your love . <\s>
<s> I could see during my life , that things for me are getting more enjoyable , with increasing experiences . <\s>
<s> I believe that this will continue in this way and my life never will be not worth for living , or less enjoyable only because I 'm `` old '' . <\s>
<s> Some may argue that successful people do n't try new things meaning that they do n't take any risks in the life . <\s>
<s> However , I disagree with this opinion and for some reasons I beleive that one should take risks in order to be successful in the life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , trying new things develops one 's imagination and creativity . <\s>
<s> In other words doing the things which we already know brings ordinarity and make people 's life monoton . <\s>
<s> I think , imagination and creativity plays very important role in being successful . <\s>
<s> Only if you have some extraordinary imagination and creativity you can succeed . <\s>
<s> I wolud like to qoute from Albert Einstein saying `` Imagination is more important than knowledge , knowledge is limited but imagination encirles the world . '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the life itself , I beleive , is a risk . <\s>
<s> No one can know for sure what tomorrow will bring . <\s>
<s> So , if we are living in a risky life , then , it is unnecessary to hesitiate to take some risks in the life . <\s>
<s> By taking risks , people increases their chances of finding new opportunies to make their lifes more enjoyable , confortable and desirable . <\s>
<s> I think , most of the successful people taking risks beacuse of the invevitability of risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , no one can know what something new will bring without trying it . <\s>
<s> I mean , of course , while something new will have both negative and positive effects , not to trying it restricts the probability of getting the positive side . <\s>
<s> I beleive that making some preliminary studies , I mean thinking , one can easily take risks in the sake of getting the positive sides . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For these reasons I stated above , I am of the opinon that successful people try new things and take risks in the life . <\s>
<s> I disagree with statement : `` in twenty yers there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' , because I do not think that our society could live with less cars , even if I would be totally pleased if it happened . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I disagree with this statment , first of all because I can see , in every day life , that the number of the cars is increasing . <\s>
<s> For example , when my mother was young her family was composed from four person and they had just one cars , but they were completely normal , now , in my family we are just three and we have two cars , and we would like to buy another car . <\s>
<s> Another important fact is that industry are always trying to make new cars with new thecnologyes inside , to emit less pollution . <\s>
<s> In this way , it would not be a problem if ther will be more cars . <\s>
<s> In addiction , cars have become foundamental in our culture both in big and little cityes , and in particoular for whose who live far from the city . <\s>
<s> Everyone nowadays who has an emergency need to have the car , to go to the supermarket , but also to the hospital etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There could be different solutions , instead of using cars , even if it is not easy to make people understand it . <\s>
<s> In particoular in big cities people should use public transport wich do not creat any pollution , and they are quick and confortable . <\s>
<s> In smaller cities , where there is not the possibility of using publing transports , people should use the bike or walk , when it is possible , wich are better both for the pollution of the enviroment and the health of the people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , unfortunately I do not think that in future there will be fewer cars in use than today . <\s>
<s> However there are several solution to the problems given by the cars than can be adopted . <\s>
<s> A person that is educated is highly regarded while , an uneducated person might sometimes be seen down upon . <\s>
<s> knowledge is a way of knowing that many people should praise upon and take this advantage to their own good . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have of one only . <\s>
<s> This way a person would know a great deal of things in more than one thing and he/she would normaly share their knowledge with other people and get also information about other subjects themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An example might be , a person that specializes in a particular field of study such as Chemistry and another person that has abroad knowledge of a lot of subjects including Chemistry meet up . <\s>
<s> The first person might only discuss Chemistry while the other , person discusses more than one subject . <\s>
<s> To me in this situation the person with the broad knowledge is infact , smarter and more experienced than that person that specialize in Chemistry . <\s>
<s> Because that person might not answer or feel lost when the other person talks about other topics . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason , might be that the person with the broad knowledge of many academic subjects migh find it easier to understand and learn about various topics . <\s>
<s> On the other hand the person that is specialized in a single subject might find it difficult to cope with the other topics that might be introduced to him/her . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An example would be if he Business major student was in a contest with the other students that take Business and other subjects . <\s>
<s> He/she might win or gain points in answering questions that deel about Business but , when it comes to answering other questions he/she might have a hard time answering it . <\s>
<s> Again I do stand by my opinion that , a person should have great understanding in many academic subjects rather in one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Who knows when that person needs to persuade another person in an area other than his/her own . <\s>
<s> It might be helpful if they know information in more than one topic . <\s>
<s> I am 24 years old and a student , so I have not so much money and I am unsure about what the future will bring . <\s>
<s> Therefore I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One reason for my disagreement is the perspective for the future , which differs between younger and older people . <\s>
<s> Younger people usually do not have concrete plans for their future . <\s>
<s> Therefore it is difficult to really enjoy life , because one always thinks about what the future will bring . <\s>
<s> I know these problem when I have to decide wether to spend a lot of money for a new computer , an enjoyment for me , or better save the money . <\s>
<s> Due to the reason that I do not know wether I will get a job , it may be better not spending so much money . <\s>
<s> Older people mostly have a job and spending the money will not have such a big importance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason why older people enjoy life more than younger people do , is their opportunity to spend more money for certain activities they enjoy . <\s>
<s> For example I would enjoy learning how to fly a plane , but I do not have enough money to take courses . <\s>
<s> Older people may have enough money to learn how to fly a plane and therefore can enjoy in doing so . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Beside these examples , enjoyment may also mean to have a wife and children . <\s>
<s> This is something generally older people have . <\s>
<s> So from my situation today , I look forward to have my own family and I think I will enjoy it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The reasons and examples above show , that older people may have less problems concerning money . <\s>
<s> They also may have a familiy and may be able to perform cost intensive activities they like . <\s>
<s> In contrast to that , younger people do not have these possibilities and often have to think about their future . <\s>
<s> Therefore I think that older people can enjoy and do enjoy their life more than younger people do . <\s>
<s> So I am looking to the future and think that I will enjoy my life when I am older . <\s>
<s> I have always believed that all advertisements make products seem more efficient than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to my own experience and to other people 's stories , I can tell that there are some relatively huge exagerations and ornamented descriptions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the points that I totally disagree with is when they show us two different situations or images . <\s>
<s> In the first one , there is something to be done and it has to be the use of the adverised product . <\s>
<s> In the second , they show a different picture with a perfect result , which is not realistic . <\s>
<s> In fact , it 's just a simulation that does n't garantee in any way such a result . <\s>
<s> I remember once , my brother saw the commercial on TV about the best selling product to treat acne . <\s>
<s> They made everyone believe the stories told by some different people who , acording to them used the product and had amazing results in a limited number of days . <\s>
<s> What proves that the person who had the face covered with acne before and who has a perfect skin looking now , had used the product ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , it 's obvious that the seller 's purpose from this advertisement is to persuade people and encourage them to purchase the product . <\s>
<s> Thereof they make it sound nice and matching the client 's needs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is also clear that competition is among the major reasons that pushes the seller to make the public compare their products to their competitors ' . <\s>
<s> This leads most of the time to an over-description of the item . <\s>
<s> For instance , many commercials show us the efficiency of detergents by washing the same dirty clothes using the advertised product and another detergent of a different or unknown brand . <\s>
<s> Then , they show us the result , with a distinct difference . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> After seeing the advertisements , I have personally bought a car that was supposed to be gas-efficient , a cream to eliminate acne and pills to lose weight . <\s>
<s> However , there is some truthiness missing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do n't exclude the efficiency of all the advertised products , yet most of them are to a different extent over-rated . <\s>
<s> There are two ideas about knowledge . <\s>
<s> One encourages the person to have extensive knowledge of his/her academic subject and the other thinks that one should have knowledge of many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> The subject should be discussed in terms of the efficency that knowledge would enhance the person to . <\s>
<s> Altough knowledge adds much to a persons general culture , specialization would let scientific truths to be turned on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Broad academic knowledge , would give much to a person because of the ability that knowledge provides to think in different ways . <\s>
<s> When a person gets to inforamation in different subjects , his ability of thinking improves . <\s>
<s> The reason of this matter is that when a person learns about an academic subject , it is required to learn its logic behind too and the different logic lets the one of thinking in different ways . <\s>
<s> In this way having a broad knowledge seems more effiecnt for a person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another subject that should be concerned is the general culture that a broad academic knowledge would come with . <\s>
<s> This would both let the person to have a better social life and also provide him/her to get a knowledge about a veriety of subjects that he/she is interested in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Despite the adventages of having a broad knowledhge , specializing on a specific academic subject has an adventage of leting one to know the nearly every information possible . <\s>
<s> When a person specializes only on one matter , one could lead to new discoveries and improvements on the subject he or she is studying . <\s>
<s> In this way , specializing in one specific subject would let one to go further to the limits of his/her subject . <\s>
<s> Itlooks better than to have a broad knowledge because one could give something useful to the society by specializing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , it would be better for individuals to make their own choises to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to speciazlize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> If to have a broad knowledge is choosen , that would provide on to have a nicer life full of different knowledge that may lead to different points of view but specializing on one subject would let the person to invent or to discover some improvements . <\s>
<s> Understanding the idea behind a fact is much more important than learning the fact by itself . <\s>
<s> This does not only apply to strict sciences like Math , but also to subject like History . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In Math , there is a set of given truths from which the rest are inferred ( prooved ) . <\s>
<s> The statements obtained from this basic set are formalized in theorems , which , in turn can be used to proove further facts ( new theorems or corollaries ) . <\s>
<s> People lacking the understanding of the basic set of truths or how the theorems were prooved would not be able to achieve further learning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In subjects like History , while knowing the facts is very important and one may think that their whole field of study , understanding the reasons that gave place to an event may give a kind of knowledge much more usefull than the mere fact . <\s>
<s> This knowledge may help identify situations that may lead to problems in the future and prevent them . <\s>
<s> So , while knowing something took place by itself may not be of much help in the future , understanding the factors that gave rise to the situation and what their consequences were , could be very important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The gain we may obtain in the future by understanding ideas and concepts is the main reason we study . <\s>
<s> Facts by themselves may be useless , understanding the concepts behind them is what is usefull . <\s>
<s> If understanding and the reasoning that goes with it were or no consequence , having an encyclopec knowledge of things would be sufficient . <\s>
<s> And that is not the case , since we have institutions whose only reason of existance is reasearch , that is , understanding concepts and ideas , to generate new facts and knowlege that may better our society . <\s>
<s> The are a quite many aspects in favor of the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts as there are aspects against it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that for students it is a lot more important to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Students not only need to have a basic knowledge of the facts , they also need to create a certain ability to transfer their knowledge . <\s>
<s> Transfering their knowledge means that problems and questions that arise during their studies are sometimes not solvable by purely learning facts and reproducing them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many times it is necessary to see interconnections between topics or solutions , for instance in a mathematical equation . <\s>
<s> If a student has to solve a difficult equation it is essential to come up with some idea how to solve it . <\s>
<s> Knowing algebra and calculus is one thing , however , the student needs to know how to apply his knowledge in order to solve the mathematical problem . <\s>
<s> Thus , learning facts will not lead him to the solution . <\s>
<s> Instead , understanding the idea of multiplying , adding , subtracting or dividing equations with a clear concept gehing it will lead him into the right direction . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By coming up with a neww concept students are force to think a lot more and make up their mind than by learning facts . <\s>
<s> It is therefore easier for them to come up with conceptual ideas and new strategies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand it is important for a student to have a profound knowledge which he will only obtain by learning facts . <\s>
<s> Learning facts means that a student will most of the time not run into a situation where he has gaps and will not be able to respond to a fact question . <\s>
<s> For lawstudents for instance , it is crucial to have a profound knowledge of facts . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact , learning facts means that you train your brain and you will be able to memorize things better than others . <\s>
<s> Additionally learnig facts enables students to expand their knowledge about all kinds of topics . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Depending on the major it is probably more important for a law student to be able to summarize facts , whereas a philosophy student is expected to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> In my opinion you cannot generalize the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> You have to differ on what their pleasure is based on . <\s>
<s> Indeed there are certain activities , like sport for example , that receive more intention by the youth rather than the older generations since they are very likely not being able to participate in these particular activities anymore due to their current health condition . <\s>
<s> But we should not forget that every older person once has been young too and enjoyed the same . <\s>
<s> With the process of growing up , we change and develop into another being that finds new ways of enjoying life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We might rather even more have to question the definition on the actual enjoying process . <\s>
<s> If joy leads us to happiness , we can also conclude that an older person might enjoy being old , because he has pretty much achieved everything he ever wanted and now feels responsible to lead the youth through the same process he has been going through . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Regarding the fact that there have always been people that were n't necessarily able to enjoy life , talking about certain disabilities or circumstances , one can conclude that we might have to offer these persons a chance to enjoy life on a different base . <\s>
<s> I can imagine that enjoying life also has a lot to do with healthy relationships that we take and depend on our entire life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In brief , this statement has only a significant value , if we compare the actual enjoying process between young and old on a particular activity , like sports , reading , etc. , but can not be generalized at all since every person can find its own pleasure of joy throughout every period of life we are facing even under the most terrifying circumstances , which exists for certain people but should be tried to taken by a community as much as possible . <\s>
<s> Ideas , concepts and facts are very important part of a students curriculum . <\s>
<s> A good student always looks for inventing new things or desires for conducting new research in his field of study . <\s>
<s> For this he always looks for new ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> I prefer ideas and concepts are more important for student rather than facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An IDEA can change ur life . <\s>
<s> We all new why NEWTON was famous . <\s>
<s> He was sleeping beneath a apple tree when suddenly apple fell from the branch , he thought over it about why apple fell down , why didnt it go up , this concept or this idea led to the famous theory which we know as newtons law of gravity . <\s>
<s> see what an idea can do , it created history and those who look for new ideas and concepts wiil definitely create history in their future course . <\s>
<s> So understanding the concepts and ideas will help a student drastically . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For any student irrespective of his field of study he has to use his own ideas . <\s>
<s> For instance a student who has joined a graduation course in the field of space explorations , he has to produce a thesis on the related subject which should be obviously a new and an intresting one . <\s>
<s> For this altough he has to collect data from previous facts , he has to incorporate his own dimensions or views of the subject what he has learned so far . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example the space scientists have to find out ways and means to preserve food as their expeditions require a 2-3 months stay in space where the conditions doesnt suit for preserving the foods . <\s>
<s> The student has the chance to innovate a perfect preserving condition and for this , apart from the data he collects from facts he has to put forward new ideas and concepts to materialise this . <\s>
<s> This can be achevied if the student clearly understands the ideas and concepts which hve been taught to him by the professors or wherever he gets information from . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thats the reason i strongly prefer that students should understand the ideas and concepts very well rather than just learning the facts . <\s>
<s> Learning the ideas and concepts will definitely diversify the knowledge of students and they would be capable enough for their future endeavours . <\s>
<s> Learning and using ideas are very important in any one 's life . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more beneficial than learning facts to students . <\s>
<s> While understanding makes students truely keep the idea , learning fact only make student memorize the idea . <\s>
<s> There are more advantages in understanding than in learning facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In these days , the society needs the people who can not only work with their knowledge but also apply it to the work place . <\s>
<s> If the people just memorized the fact , they might be a good worker but cannot be a better worker . <\s>
<s> In contrast , if the people understood the ideas and concept , they can develop the way they work by applying what they know . <\s>
<s> This is the same in the class too . <\s>
<s> In my case , I was just memorizing math formulas instead of understanding the facts . <\s>
<s> It seemed to work very well when I do the simple questions . <\s>
<s> However , in difference to my expectation , I was not able to solve the application questions . <\s>
<s> So I started to understand the concept by asking my teacher . <\s>
<s> Then , I could solve every questions on the test and recieved the good mark . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Similar to my experience in math class , one of my friend experienced the advange of understanding in English class . <\s>
<s> She has been always hard-worker . <\s>
<s> She does everything with her best effort . <\s>
<s> In her English class , she worked hard on `` Hamlet . '' <\s>
<s> She read the whole play twice and memorized important lines and devices used in the play . <\s>
<s> Her teacher , however , did not expect the stuedents to study in that way . <\s>
<s> Her teacher wanted his student to actually understand the play , and express the educated emotions about the play . <\s>
<s> On her first test , she recieved faily poor mark . <\s>
<s> So she started to look at the play in different characters ' prespectives . <\s>
<s> Then she recieved the good mark from her English teacher . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Through my experience and my friend 's , I learned that understanding is more important than just learning or memorizing facts . <\s>
<s> As shown above , when students just learn facts , they cannot apply their knowledge into the deep study , while those who understand the ideas and concepts can get better and better as they study . <\s>
<s> Thus , I think students should focuss their study on understanding instead of focussing on memorizing . <\s>
<s> Personally speaking , I totally disagree with this statement . <\s>
<s> First of all , I think young people do n't have the enough time to enjoy their lives . <\s>
<s> For example , young people , no mater where they are , will have to spend major of their time and energy `` starting '' their lives instead of enjoying their lives . <\s>
<s> They have to spend 8 or more hours working everyday and even work overtime on weekends . <\s>
<s> And I am not surprised to see young people working like dogs . <\s>
<s> As a result , they are short of time to enjoy their lives . <\s>
<s> While on the contrary , old people , on a large part , have retired from their work . <\s>
<s> So understandably , with all the time available , they can set out to enjoying their lives either by staying at home and watching TV all day without worrying about the work load or traveling around the world to different places . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , young people do n't have the necessary amount of money to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Because the majority of young people 's income is spent to support the whole family and to maintain their competitive advantages in their own fields by often taking up some training programs , they barely have any extra money to enable them to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> However , with all the saving the old people have made during all those years and no further need for them to get promoted , they can safely begin to enjoy their lives in whatever way they want to enjoy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , with the demand of their work and their family , young people never get around to thinking about how they can enjoy their lives and the fact that they do n't exactly know what life is , due to their limited life experience , has enormously deterred young people to enjoy their lives to the greatest extent . <\s>
<s> But on the other hand , old people have experienced a lot in their own life course , they well know what life is and how they can enjoy it and consequently , old people enjoy life more than young people do . <\s>
<s> In general I agree with the statement , that successful people try new things and take more risks instead of only do what they are used to do . <\s>
<s> There are several reasons why I do agree . <\s>
<s> In the first place , if you always do the same there is no development at all and your environment remains stable . <\s>
<s> It becomes boring and you do not differ from all the other people worldwide . <\s>
<s> Success occurs when you do something surprising and new . <\s>
<s> One good example is Columbus , who found America by doing something all the other men in his time hesitated . <\s>
<s> Another example is the discovery of antibiotica , which was made by accident and trying something new . <\s>
<s> Success means to differ from what is normal and familiar to the people . <\s>
<s> They want to be impressed and buy things that are new and in facion , so as a designer you also have to be creative and try new things . <\s>
<s> On the stock market you even have to take enormous risks if you want to make the highest income . <\s>
<s> Here taking risk is fundamental . <\s>
<s> Second , this is also true in the human partnerships . <\s>
<s> Here you have to take high risk to talk to the person you like and say this to him or her , but only then you can be successful by coming together and get friens or even partners . <\s>
<s> You have to take the risk and see if you fail or succeed . <\s>
<s> Without revealing your feelings to the other person you never know , if you would have been successful if you did . <\s>
<s> Success also means improvement and this needs changes and developments . <\s>
<s> But these can only take place if you take risks and try new things . <\s>
<s> Finally this statement is also true for me myself . <\s>
<s> I have chosen to take the risk and go in a foreign country to study and do my LLM instead of staying at home and complete the normal education way that lawyers have in my home country . <\s>
<s> This includes being in a new surrounding and far away from home , but it is a challenge and it perhaps leads me to a more successful career than without taking this risk to study in a foreign country . <\s>
<s> In conclusion , all these points support the idea of the statement and therefore I agree with it . <\s>
<s> Cars are playing a domintant role in human society . <\s>
<s> Cars benefits people a lot ; they make us travel faster than by bicycle ; they make it convenient for people to travel to a concert . <\s>
<s> However , cars also do harms to our daily life ; One of the most fatal harms cars make is the air pollution . <\s>
<s> There has been a debate that whether people will give up using cars in future years . <\s>
<s> As far as I am comcerned , cars will definitely be supplanted by other forms of transportation because of their disadvantages , though ther have oe or two advantages . <\s>
<s> There 're several reasons why the number of cars will decrease . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although cars have minor advantages to society , the numerous bad effects will make them dissapear after several years . <\s>
<s> A car can produce at least three tons of carbon dioxide , which lead to the serious green-house effect , and several tons of nitrogen dioxide , which result from a black smoke around the sky . <\s>
<s> with the number of cars growing in the past years , the air pollution made by car is increasingly serious these days . <\s>
<s> The laws of forbiding the use of cars have even be made in some country such as Indoesia and China . <\s>
<s> As a result , the number of the cars will definitely decline after a few years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason for the declining of cars is the limited road conditions . <\s>
<s> The more cars in the road , the slower they move . <\s>
<s> Even in some areas , people riding bicycle are much faster than people driving cars . <\s>
<s> In singapore for example , the streets are full of automobiles . <\s>
<s> It 's quite difficult for one car to move a foot . <\s>
<s> If people see that there are a myriad of cars standing in the street , then how could they buy cars any more in thefuture ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Though cars do benefits in some minor ways , and there should be a period of time to see the declining number of automobiles before the entirely disappearing of cars , the total number of cars will be fewer in the past twenty years . <\s>
<s> I do n't agree the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> From my point of view , understanding the ideas and concepts and learning the facts have equal importance because at first without facts ideas and concepts ca n't be understood . <\s>
<s> Let me explain this with a personal experience , I 'm studying textile engineering at university , in all classes our lecturers tell us the facts about textile materials and the facts about how they are produced . <\s>
<s> And then we argue on how we can improve the material qualities and production techniques and in the end of the lesson lecturer gives his/her ideas about them . <\s>
<s> By this way we learn the facts about the materials and production techniques and understands the ideas and concepts about improving them even we can create our own ideas . <\s>
<s> But if we do n't clearly know what the features of the textile material are and how it 's produced we can neither understand the ideas of the lecturer about improving them nor create our own ideas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , if you both know the facts and understand the ideas and concepts about a certain topic then you totaly know the topic . <\s>
<s> For example in an arts class if some examples of drawings of Leonardo Da Vinci are shown and the dates of them are given , it 's good you have seen how Leonardo Da Vinci 's paintings look like . <\s>
<s> But what about the idea behind these drawings ? <\s>
<s> If the lecturer tells you his/her opinions about what he might think while making these drawings or encourages you to imagine Leonardo 's mood while making these drawings then you can have a total knowledge about Leonardo Da Vinci 's art . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion in order to gain the exact knowledge of a certain topic at first students should learn facts and then understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Education system should be organized according to this logic from primary school to university in order to raise well educated and intellectual students . <\s>
<s> In a lifetime , be successful is very hard and people usually try to be only good at something and not really successful . <\s>
<s> What is the difference between successful people and the rest of the world ? <\s>
<s> This question has to be answered to understand why successful people are so special . <\s>
<s> If someone said that the key of success is trying new things , I would strongly agree with this statement , because of many reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the reasons for what I agree with this idea is the way you become successful . <\s>
<s> Successful people are special people , which means they have done something special , something nobody has done before them . <\s>
<s> The only way to make something special is trying new things , which is already a risk to take . <\s>
<s> For example , a young and beautiful girl wants to be a famous model . <\s>
<s> For what I know , the first step is being noticeable by a photographer , in meaning to be chosen between a large group of beautiful women . <\s>
<s> It could be very difficult to do if this young woman does n't try some new attitude , posture , even when she is n't sure about her move . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason is that successful people are often venturous . <\s>
<s> They like venture and that why they can go further . <\s>
<s> They go over their own limits . <\s>
<s> Once they know how to do something , they always want to learn something else over and over again . <\s>
<s> According to the `` people '' magazines , most of Stars were poor in their childhood . <\s>
<s> They came from destroyed families , divorced families and all kind of big issues . <\s>
<s> However , they had the dream of becoming successful , so they decide do to something uncommon . <\s>
<s> They decided to leave all the things they already knew , to do something they had n't done before . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think that the risk is the key of success for all successful people . <\s>
<s> Many people believe that young people enjoy life to a higher degree than older people do . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , this is a statement that is not correct since it fundamentally denies the complexity of the issues of joy , life and age and tries to deliver a general and simplified statement . <\s>
<s> In those crucial matters , however , I believe that trying to make a general point is not helpful in any way . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I disagree with that statement , both because of its content and because of the way the content is delivered , namely through generality . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , it is certainly a question of the perspective from which one looks at to what degree people enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Young people might believe that older people enjoy life less because of their decreasing health conditions or because of the decay of their outward appearence whereas older people might be of the opinion that it is the youth that enjoys life less since , being at an early stage of life , they still have all the hardships of life in front of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this connection , it is certainly a question of definition what it means to `` enjoy life '' . <\s>
<s> There is no such thing as a scale measuring the joy in life that valid for every person , and there is no need to create such scale . <\s>
<s> Everyone has a different view on life and different expectations that contributed to joyful life . <\s>
<s> Some people enjoy life doing sports , others enjoy life by achieving financial success . <\s>
<s> That feeling is not objective but rather subjective and it is not possible to really compare those individual feelings . <\s>
<s> Different people have different priorities in life . <\s>
<s> Thus , trying to decide whether younger people enjoy life more than older people do or vice versa seems impossible since it denies the very individual character traits , opinions and views that one holds . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , it is a question of how old one really feels . <\s>
<s> As for myself , I know a 73-year-old man who is as active as he could ever be , perfectly indulging in sports everyday by running cross country before breakfast . <\s>
<s> This exemplifies that every individual is as distinctly different from others . <\s>
<s> Therefore , categories of people enjoying life more or less than others do not make any sense . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of the fact that on the one hand , everyone has to define solely for himself or herself what it means to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Many people might have different points of view on this particular topic based on their personal experiences or their social status . <\s>
<s> Moreover , since the lifespan of human has greatly extended compared to the past due to advanced health care system , it might be even difficult to classify between younger people and older people . <\s>
<s> However , if I narrow down the definition of young people to a stage of teenager I definetely support the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , young people does not have any health concerns while the older 's do . <\s>
<s> I often see a lot of old people visiting local hopital to check up thier health on a regular basis . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , young people , especially teenagers are not feard with such things . <\s>
<s> Thus , they likely to experience new things that they never had tried in their lives , such as smoking , drinking with friends . <\s>
<s> Those surely might be very interesting and exiciting for teenages because they might think or feel that they are approaching an unknown territory that they have never explored . <\s>
<s> In addition , unlike old people who has health limitations , young people could definetely start any kind of sports that they are interested in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second of all , age of teenagers is the stage when you do not have to seriouly concern about your future career path . <\s>
<s> While you are at school , you can try to taste variety of ranges of studies and look for what subject attracts you the most . <\s>
<s> Nobody would force you to take courses that you dislike . <\s>
<s> In contrast , many old people might have put away their dreams to be a scientist or a firefighter in order to have more stablilty in financial matters . <\s>
<s> From time to time , old people can not enjoy their hobbies or stop them from traveling around the world because they have responsibility to support and raise their children . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Amoung many reasons , those arguements I mentioned above are the ones I believe the major differences between older people and young people . <\s>
<s> People 's taste and favor might vary from a certain stage of age to another . <\s>
<s> However , the sure thing is that the responsibilty and concern grow bigger as you get older . <\s>
<s> Thus , limiting the old people from starting a new thing and this fact leads me to a conclusion that younger people have much more fun in their lives and you should not waste such precious time . <\s>
<s> My best travel was the travel without a tour guide . <\s>
<s> The travel is still good memory even it was long time ago and I will never forget it . <\s>
<s> I believe that the best way to travel is a travel planed and made by myself from three reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One reason is before the travel . <\s>
<s> Before the travel , I need to decide where to go , where to stay , and what to do . <\s>
<s> From that moment , the travel has already started . <\s>
<s> It is enjoynable to find the best travel which fit to myself . <\s>
<s> I also can find the cheapest travel by looking at the internet . <\s>
<s> I like to spend more money in eating than staying the good hotel , so I can choose cheeper place to stay . <\s>
<s> I can plan everything what I want . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason is during the travel . <\s>
<s> The destination is usually the place where I have never been , so I want to see many new things during the travel . <\s>
<s> If I go abroad , one of my purpose to travel is to experience other cultures . <\s>
<s> If I have an opportunity , I `` m willing to talk to the people living there even if I ca n't speak the language they use . <\s>
<s> If the communication is successful , I feel happy . <\s>
<s> Sometimes travelling without a tour guide is adventurous . <\s>
<s> I may lose my way , however , I can go to the restaurant which I found accidentally . <\s>
<s> I do n't know what my travel will be . <\s>
<s> It is better to travel by myself sp that I can communicate with local people and enjoy the accident . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , time is limited during the travel . <\s>
<s> Within the limited time , I have to go and see all I want . <\s>
<s> If the travel is led by a tour guide , I cannot stay the one place . <\s>
<s> Even I do n't finish looking around , I have to leave there . <\s>
<s> It 's better to travel without a tour guide because I can spend time where I want to . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , travelling is fun because I can make plans which is best for me , experience the culture there , and spend my time . <\s>
<s> Traveling by myself is more possible to have a wonderful trip . <\s>
<s> `` Successful '' , how does one relate to this word . <\s>
<s> It basically means someone who has attained adulation and appreciation for a certain something that he or she has done . <\s>
<s> It can also be described as a way of getting acceptance from the society for an idea that you believe in or u have faith in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus a successful person would obviuosly be someone who belives in and is not scared of exploring his ideas and trying to attract acceptance for the same . <\s>
<s> Inorder for a person to gain success a percievierence , determination and hard work play key roles in a person 's life . <\s>
<s> A sucessful person thus takes risks and tries new ideas and differnt ways of doing things . <\s>
<s> therefore success only knocks on those peoples door 's who beieve in themselves and dare to walk into unfamiliar territory . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Take for example Mr.Dhirubhai Ambani who started off with a not very well off chidhood but with his grit and hardwok turned his dreams into reality . <\s>
<s> From a small scale industry his company today is one of the biggest and most important company 's in India , Its play 's a very important part in the commerce of our country along with helping in buliding some highly complex and neccessary equipments . <\s>
<s> His initial success gave him the confidence to go ahead and bring about new innovative plans and his hardwork and vision changed them into a successful ventures , Thus successful people do try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore sucess is not only related to doing the same things over and over again but also in trying newer and better ideas to make a large enough impact in society inorder to carve a niche for yourselves and then work upwards from there , <\s>
<s> A company 's main purpose is to create a product that will sell no matter what ; at least that is our common knowledge . <\s>
<s> Fortunately , there are also many companies who believe in making a great product that will be eficient and meet the needs of their buyers . <\s>
<s> Still it is not known which happens the most , but it is quite obvious that in either case they use advertising to sell their product . <\s>
<s> It is pesimistic to say that most companies lie to their propective buyers to get them to buy their product through great advertising , but it is somewhat true . <\s>
<s> There are those that sell their product as it is , and others that sell it by painting it better than what they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I 've actually been exposed to both types of advertising and can say that I 've felt cheated by the second one . <\s>
<s> Who has n't yearn to buy one of those miracle creams shown on tv ? <\s>
<s> Those that remove scars or make your breasts grow , at least that is what the `` users '' say on tv . <\s>
<s> Yet , not everyone has bought them because they know better than to be fooled by those ads . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , I was fooled . <\s>
<s> I bought a cream that would remove stretch marks , and was obviously disappointed when three weeks later I saw no results so I gave my dermatologist a visit where he told me that there was no cream that would remove them . <\s>
<s> This advertisings are quite misleading and always make you waste your money , especially to those of us who does n't have money to spare . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Luckily , I have also bought products that have achieved what they promised on their adevertismentes . <\s>
<s> M & M 's ads guarantee that they 'll melt in your mouth and not in your hand , and they certainly do melt in my mouth . <\s>
<s> Likewise , a new so called `` Vanish Poder O2 '' which promises that it will remove almost every stain off your clothes , really does . <\s>
<s> Once I took my cousins favorite white jacket without her permission , and obviously I had to drip some blackberry icecream on it . <\s>
<s> I got to her house very quickly and told her maid to clean it for me . <\s>
<s> Two hours later , the jacket was completely whiten by `` Vanish Poder O2 '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I cannot say I blame companies to lie on their ads so people will buy their products , because I have also painted myself a few times better than what I really am , not by saying huge lies , just by improving a few defects . <\s>
<s> Still , I hate to feel ashamed for believing those companies , but not enough to damage my belief that not all companies are like me . <\s>
<s> The conclusion that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , sounds correct to me . <\s>
<s> There are two arguments that are interesting to consider in evaluating the conclusion above . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , if we assume that colleges and universities are currently using the best strategies and tools to teach students , it is clear that concepts and ideas are fundamental and more important then facts to build the basic knowledge of students . <\s>
<s> In fact , at engineering universities all the courses in the first couple of years are about algebra , geometry and phisics . <\s>
<s> All of those courses are about ideas and concepts ; no one of them refers to facts or applications . <\s>
<s> By learning ideas and concepts , students can develop abilities of reasoning and thinking that in the future they will need to solve real problems and to understand facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , it is much more worthwhile studying generalitazion rather then specific applications . <\s>
<s> In fact , in our real world it is unbelievable to know everything about facts and memorize them . <\s>
<s> Instead , ideas and general concepts can be applied everywhere and help to understand every fact . <\s>
<s> Moreover , our world is running so fast that scientists and researchers discovery every day new thesis and models . <\s>
<s> If a student knows how to deal with abstract ideas and concept , he or she can easily understand every thing is new and has came up in our world . <\s>
<s> Facts ate constrained by context and circumstances and are very useful to fix and remember ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , students must understand firstly ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> It is helpful for reasoning and thinking abilities as well as for understanding facts . <\s>
<s> I do agrre with the fact that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather that those who only do what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , the ability to try new things is a quality that allows you to learn new things all the time . <\s>
<s> By doing this , a person will certainly know many diverse things and develop open-mindness . <\s>
<s> Compared to people who only use what they know and do well , a curious person will master many different things and be able to be really successful . <\s>
<s> For instance , Steve Jobbs , Apple 's CEO , mastered computers since he was very young . <\s>
<s> However , by trying new things , in his case selling his products he became one of the most successful man in today 's world . <\s>
<s> I thus , strongly believe that this open-mindness was , appart of his genious , what made him successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I think that taking risks is something harder than just trying new things . <\s>
<s> Taking a risk has , by definition , good sides and bad sides . <\s>
<s> The bad sides are that you can take a risk beeing as enthousiastic as you want , you can fail . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , I think that risk-taking is a key to the success . <\s>
<s> Indeed , taking a risk is the equivalent of betting on the future and I believe that someone who cannot take this risk and think about the future wo n't be successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , all of this is general speaking and each person have a different vision of what success is . <\s>
<s> However , at last but not least , I believe that knowing how to use what we already know and learn ing new things will make someone successful . <\s>
<s> Although there is a good reason for advertising products , I believe that advertising make products seem better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Three reasons convince me that advertising is making products appear much better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , with the development of new technologies it is much easier today to adjust pictures or films as you wish . <\s>
<s> Flaws or even scratches can disappear by just a mouse click . <\s>
<s> The use of moderne software even helps to make fat things look slimmer , which you can see on pictures that show legs wearing stockings . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , good looking things sell better . <\s>
<s> The first reason for a company is to sell their products because they live on it and exist on it . <\s>
<s> Therefore companies are willing to do the best to let their product be the best even if it ; s only by appearance on a big screen or wallpaper hanging somewhere at the train station or elsewhere . <\s>
<s> A product that is not attractive to the customer will stay with the company . <\s>
<s> Companies are using female and male models to support their product . <\s>
<s> They want to give us a feeling that if these models use this product we - the customer - can trust them becuase faces and behavior in front of us can not be a lie . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , companies use movies to offer their products . <\s>
<s> When ever people switch on the televison they can not escape the comercials shown for hours and hours on the screen or at the cinemas in your hometown and of course all over the world . <\s>
<s> By using this intensive propaganda technique customers are not save anymore . <\s>
<s> Customers rarely find a niche to avoid advertisments and their apealing looks . <\s>
<s> For this intensive attack on customers the companies spend libarally amounts of mony . <\s>
<s> They develop special movies to reach all customers around the globe . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even in movies we find again the above mentioned method that models are use to support a specific item and it ; s advantages . <\s>
<s> So , many actors and actress make money by the way . <\s>
<s> Customers like to identify themself with these movie stars and this leads to an increase in selling . <\s>
<s> Even if customers have n't tried such products before thy just rely on what thy are told or have seen . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , we only knew things from TV or movies but we have great interst in buying it because we have seen it or believe an artifical picture <\s>
<s> Even though there can be goods arguments found against the statement that successful people try new things rather than stay at the point where they are I 'm of the opinion that this statement is true . <\s>
<s> To underline my thoughts following reasons are given : First , if somebody is very succesful it is usually also very self-confident . <\s>
<s> So if there is something new a successful person will not say : `` I am unable to manage this new task '' . <\s>
<s> It will be rather the other way round : `` I have managed everything to my satisfaction , of course I will also manage this new task '' . <\s>
<s> The risk will not be seen at first glance . <\s>
<s> So a successful person trusts in its ablities to succed . <\s>
<s> In the past everything turned out to be right ; so it will also do in the future . <\s>
<s> A failure is not to be seen as a negative experience . <\s>
<s> A failure is a possibility to do it better the next time . <\s>
<s> There is no fear to lose bo doing the new risky thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason in my opinion is that a succesful person would get bored continuing doing the same all the time . <\s>
<s> This person needs new challenge to deal with . <\s>
<s> Let 's take an example from the field of sports . <\s>
<s> A good tennisplayer does n't want to compete with persons playing the same level . <\s>
<s> The players has to improve and learn new techniques to be able to compete also with persons of a higher stage . <\s>
<s> It 's the same in the business field . <\s>
<s> Why stay be assignements already done for many times ? <\s>
<s> A new challenge is needed . <\s>
<s> New thing have to be discussed , tried even invented . <\s>
<s> Otherwise there can be no step forward seen . <\s>
<s> The successful person needs to feel the success again . <\s>
<s> After having been successful in one field somebody does n't recognise the success anymore . <\s>
<s> Sucess is something usual . <\s>
<s> So the feeling of having success has to be found in a new way . <\s>
<s> This is especially the new risk which has to be taken . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , in my point of view successful people do n't have any fear by trying new things . <\s>
<s> They even need to risk something new otherwise they would get bored after some time doing the same . <\s>
<s> Older people have a lot of responsibilties they have to attend to and undertake . <\s>
<s> However , young people have everything provided to them by their parents . <\s>
<s> Young people led carefree lives . <\s>
<s> Thus young people are able to enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> older people are constantly worried about maintaining their job so they can support their families . <\s>
<s> Older people also have to take care of their children . <\s>
<s> older people are busy every minute of their lives . <\s>
<s> If they are not at work then they have to clean the house and cook dinner for their families . <\s>
<s> Older people also have to take the education and future of their children into thier own hands . <\s>
<s> The older people are have to help the children with their homework or make sure the children finishe their homework . <\s>
<s> Above all , the older people have to constantly work to afford the thing their children desire and spend their free time with the children and bond with them . <\s>
<s> As a result , the older people are giving up their only free time for the younger people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The young people are not tied down by the same responsiblities as the adultd . <\s>
<s> The young people only have the responsibilites of school and maybe cleaning their room . <\s>
<s> As a result , they have more free time to play and do the thing they enjoy . <\s>
<s> After compeleting thier homework the young people can go to the movies with friends or do anything they like . <\s>
<s> The young people do n't have to work to gain anything . <\s>
<s> When young people need anything , such as meals and money , they are provided by the parents . <\s>
<s> They have a house to live , in contrast to older people who have to worry about eraning money to afford a house . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people are less able to enjoy life because of responsibilites . <\s>
<s> They are at constant motion to full fill them . <\s>
<s> But , the young people are more blessed . <\s>
<s> Parents support threm with many things they needed in life . <\s>
<s> The young people have their parents to fall back on when they are in trouble . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they are more inclined to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects without a specific specialization would give one information that is excessive , irrelevant , desultory in nature if it has to be applied to one 's vocation , service , a profession . <\s>
<s> So I would disagree with the pursuit of many fields of study without any subject to specialize in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , if a student of engineering pursues courses in performing arts , like dance , it might enhance the talent and social value of the person but it would not contribute to his performance in his role as an academician or a professional as an engineer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Each subject has many specializations within its field . <\s>
<s> Education in itself is expensive . <\s>
<s> Compared to the working population , for various reasons , a relatively smaller percentage of people pursue education after high school , earn a baccalaureate degree and then begin , complete Graduate School also . <\s>
<s> For example , Psychology has other sub-fields of Clinical , Counseling , Education which serve different purposes in helping the recipients of its services . <\s>
<s> Or let 's take the example of a doctor who has taken courses in various subjects rather than emphasizing his learning in surgery , or medicine , or cancer . <\s>
<s> How can he/she help patients to get well with a broad knowledge that covers subjects of political science , medicine , english etc . ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If the schools of higher learning do not build their departments around a particular subject , for example , social work or social policy ; the administration , teaching , evaluation the courses being taught would suffer seriously . <\s>
<s> Till secondary school level , many academic subjects can be learnt and it is good for our general knowledge . <\s>
<s> But as the focus of education shifts to colleges and universities , it makes sense intellectually , practically , knowledge-wise to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> This would help people to fulfil various roles , perform the services required to have a functional society . <\s>
<s> The society , its educational , social and health systems would be in chaos in the event of a scenario where education would lack focus , training , depth in every particular field of study . <\s>
<s> Having a wide perspective and a broad knowledge in many academic fields is much better and necessary than specializing in a single subject , especially in our modern and diverse societies . <\s>
<s> This necessity becomes much more apperant when one considers social studies . <\s>
<s> Academic work in social fields , because they are mainly dealing with human beings and their actions , unlike engineering , requires a broad understanding of human behaviour in order to make meaningful and accurate assestments of their actions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many of the issues that we face today are very much inter-related . <\s>
<s> It is very hard to isolate a single problem from the other and specifically study it without ever engaging its neigboring fields . <\s>
<s> For instance , a sociologist who plans to study the criminal tendency among an specific cultural group must not only have information about the history of these people , but must also have an adequate amount of knowledge about how economic conditions which might influence human behaviour should be interpreted . <\s>
<s> Moreover , she must have a knowledge of interpreting economical data , which would also necessiate a minimum level knowledge of statistical data . <\s>
<s> Hence , as illustrated above , a study on criminal tendency would at least necessiate knowledge of history , economics and statistics . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another difficulty with focusing in one specific subject is that it narrows your perspective and may result in disorientation regarding the place that the specific subject occupies within the general picture . <\s>
<s> Every social event , apart from its internal structure or working , is also interacting with other parts of the social field in an active way . <\s>
<s> Therefore , many times in order to get a meaningful analysis of the particular social structure that one is analyzing , it should be placed within a wider context and interpreted within the light that the context sheds on it . <\s>
<s> Without this broader outlook , it is possible to fall into many cliches and misinterpret a social structure . <\s>
<s> For instance , some practices concerning woman in many eastern cultures might seem oppressive to a western academic , if she only focuses on that specific practice . <\s>
<s> However , a broader perspective which puts that social practice within the context , for example a religious context , could make it much more understandable . <\s>
<s> The act which seems oppressive might be reinterpreted as based on the consent of woman , and therefore not constituting a form of power relation . <\s>
<s> Therefore , putting things in context and looking at them from a wider perspective would yield to better results . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We are living in an increasingly diverse societies and it is much more easier for different people to interact with each other due to the advencements in information technologies . <\s>
<s> Within this diverse world , any academic who takes interest only at a single specific field would be lacking the necessary tools for producing meaningful analysis of society . <\s>
<s> Therefore , what the modern world needs is academics who are trained in different fields and academics who can put together information from different fields into meaningful wholes . <\s>
<s> The issue about whether understanding ideas is more important than learning facts is a complex one . <\s>
<s> Personally , I am convinced that facts are less important than ideas . <\s>
<s> In the following paragraphs I will try to explain the reason why I believe this . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , understanding ideas is more difficult than merely memorizing facts . <\s>
<s> Even a little child can memorize dates , names of famous battles , names of kings etc . <\s>
<s> But it takes much more effort to understand the ideas and the implications behind these facts . <\s>
<s> Take for example the French Revolution . <\s>
<s> Anyone can memorize the year : 1789 . <\s>
<s> But understanding the far-reaching outcome of it is a much more complex issue ! <\s>
<s> The french revolution 's results can still be observed in the world we are living right now , where governments rely on democracy rather than monarchy . <\s>
<s> While remembering a date is something anyone could do , performing a profound analysis on the plethora of causes and the multitude of effects of such an important event is not so easy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second point I would like to stress is that learning facts is not so useful in everyday life as it is understanding concepts . <\s>
<s> What I mean by this is : what is the point of learning the exact year of a battle or the death of an important person ? <\s>
<s> It might only come useful when being on a TV quiz show or when playing `` Trivial Pursuit '' . <\s>
<s> Instead , delving into the causes , the effects and the main idea behind it , can prove useful . <\s>
<s> Understanding the main idea that lies behind a fact can help someone obtain precious insight on very important issues like , for example , human nature . <\s>
<s> Many antropological studies in fact , rely on histrorical events when trying to explain human behaviour . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To summarize , I believe that ideas are more relevant than facts when it comes to studies and that the universities should be more focused on having students understanding ideas and concepts behind a fact , rather that the fact itself . <\s>
<s> By virtue of having ` been there , done that ' , I believe that older people with the gamut of experiences that comprise their lives , enjoy life more so than the young ones who are yet to find their feet . <\s>
<s> A younger body also implies a mind that is yet to develop to its full potential . <\s>
<s> Despite the physical crutches that age may come with , it remains a magnificent process of learning and developing as an individual . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is said that with age comes experience . <\s>
<s> The experience of years past allows an individual to view situations differently . <\s>
<s> The reaction of a 6 year old on getting his first cycle might seem more jubilant than that of his grandfather but the quite pride of watching his grandson gleam with pleasure , speaks of the hard work and commitment that the wrinkled face one sees has learn to put in , to give others such joy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My friend 's sister , Rita , had had a fight with her friend Ayesha over a trivial matter . <\s>
<s> Whlist she did n't want to b the first to aplogise , she still spent the day in a foul mood waiting for Ayesha to initiate the peace making process . <\s>
<s> For a young person , a certain situation might seem more complex than it actually is and that was the situation here till Rita 's mother explained to Rita that she needed to judge what held greater importance - her own pride which forbid her from calling , or then her relationship with a friend . <\s>
<s> As an older individual , her mother was able to share her own perspective that would enable Rita to make intelligent emotional choices in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As one gets older , it cannot be assumed that one stops enjoying one 's life . ' <\s>
<s> I feel young at heart ' , Ive heard my father say many a times which brings me to the only conclusion - the number of candles on your cake do n't decide how happy you are but how you spend the time that is marked yours . <\s>
<s> Although students in the same class take same courses under identical circumstances in terms of instructor , teaching aids and experience , and assigned textbooks , two groups of students may arise after that course . <\s>
<s> During and after the course , some students will focus on understanding ideas and concepts , while others will be content of accepting absolute facts undoubtly . <\s>
<s> I belong to the first type of students , and hence I strongly agree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When you take a course , whether it is at university or school , with intention in your mind to just receive passively new facts then to ga back home , then allow me to tell you that you are missing the point ! <\s>
<s> Students who want the instructor to merely plug in data and information into their brains in class , with no deep and profound interest in the topic , are on their way to become dummy as machines . <\s>
<s> They will never raise relevant questions in lectures nor participate actively in any class discussion . <\s>
<s> This , in effect , will lead them to the what so-called cramming . <\s>
<s> Exam crammers may enjoy good results , in some situations , for a while , but they will regret it in the soon future . <\s>
<s> I believe that learning is about understanding new material , questioning results and facts , knowing how things work or why they are the way they are , then moving to your own conclusions and evaluation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if your purpose of taking any course is to comprehend it to the most , then you are on the right track . <\s>
<s> Students who dive into this deeper level of understanding will excell , not only in academic life , but also in the professional one . <\s>
<s> Thorough examination of the topic you are studying will get you beyond mathematical equations , if you are studying technology , or beyond clusters of words and paragraphs if you deal with literature . <\s>
<s> Information will make much more sense to your mind , and you will feel the real power of knowledge when you study in order to understand , not just to pass the next exam . <\s>

<s> In conclusion , understanding the underlying concepts and definitions behind any learning topic is more solid and lasting than going through facts quickly . <\s>
<s> The benefits are promising and will become more evident in the students future . <\s>
<s> `` Why should I spend my evening with helping in the community center ? <\s>
<s> I have to help myself to get to enjoy at least some part of the day after school ! '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is the answer of my friend I received yesterday when I asked her to accompany me to help in a kids swimming-class at the community center . <\s>
<s> So I sometimes wonder whether it is true that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Life in a community follows simple rules . <\s>
<s> One basic principle is the one of giving and receiving . <\s>
<s> `` You get as much as you give ! '' <\s>
<s> Concerning the special aspect of time in our society today time has become a rare good . <\s>
<s> With regards to the tendency of increasing egotism and cold calculations in the sense of whether spending time on certain actions can be beneficial for us . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If the answer to this question is negative we tend no to do it even if the moralicly correct decision would be differently . <\s>
<s> In the case of my friend , who I asked to help in a swimming-class for kids it would not be lucrative for her to do so . <\s>
<s> In her opinion , the time she is spending at the community centre is `` lost time '' because there are neither advantages to be expected nor is it a freetime activity where she can enjoy heself because it is like a job one does not get payed for . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But maybe there is something else which makes this activity `` lucrative '' . <\s>
<s> Maybe we should consider the aspect of love for others - even with the image of an egotistic youth ? <\s>
<s> If I respect what other parts of my community do for me , for example drive me to school , I am respecting their effort , the time they invest partly also in me . <\s>
<s> Therefore - being driven to school and people investing time in me - I am glad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And being glad I come to the conclusion that I might not be as glad if the others did not invest the much time . <\s>
<s> Concluding this my goal would be to keep others investing time in the community . <\s>
<s> Since they will only do this if they also get something back I necessarily have to invest time in the community myself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And I might also find a task with which I can help , invest time and at the same time have fun myself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion this is not an utopia of community life . <\s>
<s> I have found such a task myself . <\s>
<s> Since I love swimming and have a certain knowledge how to teach it and also adore children I combine both . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I give swimming-classes at the community center every wednesday evening and enjoy this very much . <\s>
<s> Finally I suggest to make clear to young people that giving some of their expensive time to the community they receive even more than expected . <\s>
<s> And that in the end this moral and communital behaviour can turn out to be very lucrative for everyone ! <\s>
<s> Somebody might say , that as people grow richer , more people can afford cars , while others might argue , that as fossil fuels grow scarce , people will abondan cars for more energy saving means of transport such as busses and trains . <\s>
<s> In this topic I will represent both of these opinions , and give my personal opinion on it , too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When the car was invented , in the late 19th century , no one would have expected this invention to become as big as it is now . <\s>
<s> A long time after the invention had been done , only the very rich could afford a car , and the advantages of having one were very limited . <\s>
<s> There were not enough paved roads , the cars were slow and unreliable , and there were plenty of other forms of transportation around , that seemed a lot more promising for the future . <\s>
<s> However , due to mass production the prices for cars dwindled , highways got built and thanks to the world wide economic recovery in the fifties and sixties most people in the industrialized world were able to purchase motor vehicles . <\s>
<s> While the market for cars in the developed world might have been saturated years ago , third world countries have been able to increase the number of cars in use there dramatically over the last decade or so . <\s>
<s> And as many of these countries seem to boom at an insane pace , who knows just how many cars will circulate on this planet in 20 years time . <\s>
<s> It might seem like there is no limit to it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I personally do not agree with that . <\s>
<s> This is mainly due to two current developments that have been taken place for quite a while now : The energy source , that most cars run on is gas . <\s>
<s> However oil reserves are being used up and some experts claim that within some decades from now , all of the earth 's oil will have been depleted . <\s>
<s> So unless a new way of making cars run is discovered , fewer and fewer cars will be able to run . <\s>
<s> The other development , unfavorable to a gro is global warming : People all over the globe have realized , that CO2 emission caused by cars ( and many other things as factories , powerplants and so on ) is damaging the ozon layer , which is needed to keep the earth 's temperature stable . <\s>
<s> By using public transportation instead of one 's personal vehicle a lot of these CO2 emission could be reduced . <\s>
<s> It might also be possible that governments , will interfere puting a quota on how much each person can drive his car . <\s>
<s> So my personal opinion is that cars will be less used by the year 2026 than now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If , however , alternative power sources for cars like hydrogen or solar energy , became cheaper , I personally cannot tell whether more or less cars will be in use in 20 years time . <\s>
<s> Nowadays people use in every circumstance the car : in my country every family owns at least a car and sometimes they even have a car each . <\s>
<s> The car is actually a symbol of the contemporary society as much as computers or mobile phones . <\s>
<s> We all know how usefull and comfortable it is to go by car , and how faster we can get to very far distances , but we usually forget how devastating it is fot the earth . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion sooner or later there will be fewer cars : first of all , the price of petrol will rise so much that it will be impossible for a normal family to afford a car trip . <\s>
<s> In facts , on one hand it will be soon very difficult to find new petrol sources because they are disappearing and they are able to regenerate themself olny in thousands of years . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , those big companies that held the petrol distribution have no interest in developing new energy sources that could be cheaper for the costumers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I hope that soon there will be more laws against pollution : indeed , the governments of all the world have to admit the fact that if the planet is too polluted there is no possibility of life for the human race . <\s>
<s> This strategy should start as soon as possible , giving money for the reserch of natural energy and giving more opportunity to the people to consume less energy and to pollute less . <\s>
<s> There are many ways to do this : indeed , cities should have efficent public transport , or maybe the people that use solar pannels or other natural energy devices in their houses should be helped by the government . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , there is the possibility that the people will start to leave their cars at home and go by foot : I am quite sceptical about it , but I really hope that the people will understand how important the enviroment is for our lives . <\s>
<s> In this essay , I will explain why I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> For this , I will say that younger people benefit from a better physical and mental health in general , then I 'll talk about the issue of the money and finally I 'll talk about the free time for those two category of people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , it is well known that young people have a better health than older people . <\s>
<s> A good health allow someone to run , jump , make several sports and also to have a better resistence to alcool , illness or the need to sleep . <\s>
<s> This is why young people do much more sport and parties than when they become old . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> After that , i 'd say that when we are young , we want to move , to travel or to try new experiences . <\s>
<s> As you 're old , you 've already tried lots of things , you may be less kind to try new challenges because you feel that you may not be able to do it . <\s>
<s> I sobserve it when I see my grandparents . <\s>
<s> They do n't move from their apartment because they do n't have the courage to do so . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people can say that older persons have more money , that 's why they can do more things . <\s>
<s> I totally disagree whith that because some of them do n't use their money at all and stay at home all the day . <\s>
<s> Others may travel , for exemple I have a grand mother who travelled in India a few years ago . <\s>
<s> But it was a well organized trip , the kind of trip where you always stay with the same people since the departure at your airport . <\s>
<s> I do n't think that this is the best way to discover and enjoy a new country . <\s>
<s> Generally , if they have money , they use it the wrong way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , it is true that when you stop working , you have all the time you want to enjoy life but as I said before , it is not what happens in most cases , particulary after seventy years old . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , when you 're young , you study or you start working . <\s>
<s> I think that this is not why you have less free time that you do n't use it well . <\s>
<s> And sometimes I feel better being with my friends in a classroom than alone watching a movie for exemple . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> These are the reasons why I think that younger people enjoy life more than older peole do . <\s>
<s> Yes , i definitely agree with this statement that young people nowadays dont give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> In this modern world , younsters seem to be too engrossed with their work . <\s>
<s> They are really striving for success . <\s>
<s> But while doing so , they forget their moral responsibilities and duties . <\s>
<s> The older people really care about the society . <\s>
<s> Most of them are philanthropists and are concerned about the development . <\s>
<s> They offer their help , wherever they can for the upliftment of their community . <\s>
<s> For example , in a locality , if there is a major power failure and the locality is plunged into darkness , it ll always be the older people who will report this problem to the concerned authority . <\s>
<s> The younger people feel that they have better things to do in life , rather than performing acts of altruism . <\s>
<s> Such kind of an attitude should be done away with . <\s>
<s> They youth should realize that the future of the society is their hands . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Words like ethics , priniciples seem to have died out in todays 's world . <\s>
<s> Take for example , a student studying in high school . <\s>
<s> He is doing really well in his studies and scoring high grades in all of the subjects which are being taught to him . <\s>
<s> But besides this , he should also offer some help to his community . <\s>
<s> He can do this by helping the weaker students out with their academics . <\s>
<s> Also , he should think about the students living in the sub urbs who cannot afford to go to school . <\s>
<s> He should be inspired by this very famous saying `` Each one teach one '' . <\s>
<s> Hence he should take the initiative and rise to the occassion . <\s>
<s> He can offer help by taking lectures there , because education is the pillar of the nation . <\s>
<s> Social service should be an integral part in everone 's life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , i feel that its high time , that youngsters start contributing to the communities by offering their help in whichever field they can . <\s>
<s> Be it in schools , hospitals or offices . <\s>
<s> They should set an example for the generations to follow , by being benevolent and therby make this place a better place to live . <\s>
<s> I totally disagree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Why there would be fewer cars in the future ? <\s>
<s> Now I 'm explaining my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , after a little time from its creation , the car has become the most useful , and used , way to go from a place to another . <\s>
<s> Even if there are several ways to move , for example the public means , like the train , the bus or the aereo , every family , or maybe almost everyone , has one on his own . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A car , in fact , allows to not to have limitations of time when you move and then , using it , you can go pratically everywhere . <\s>
<s> Furthermore I find that 's a very important thing that you have the possibility to buy the one you best like : you are allowed to choose its colour , its seats , its type , ( familiar , cabrio or any you prefer ! ) , so there is n't the problem to take a journey on a mean you do n't like . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The only limitation is the money you can spend , but this is another problem . <\s>
<s> And for this there 's a solution , too : at now every car-seller gives you the opportunity to pay your buyment on rates . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last , but not least , I think that the only idea to own a car , gives you a sort of sense of indipendence : you 're able to move without the help of someone else , it can be a great satisfation ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For these , and many other , arguments , I think that people will continue in buying cars , and in using them of course . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , if there would be a time when there should be fewer cars , it 's right now , because of the high ( to use an euphemysm ) prize of oil , and especially because of the knowledge we have that more cars are the equivalent of more polution in the air all we breath . <\s>
<s> So , I think , if people do n't stop buying and using cars today , why should they do it tomorrow ? <\s>
<s> Do young people do n't give enough time to help their communities ? <\s>
<s> Maybe , but do older people give enough time their community and does n't - to speak a bit epic and controverse - every community get 's the people it earns ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In times were individualisation and the quest for profit are predominant , how can one expect from young people to give time in the old altruistic fashion to their community . <\s>
<s> All they learn through the medias is that it is cool to be rich , cool to be successful and that the best method of acquriing these goals is to stay focussed and not to waste their time . <\s>
<s> And if one considers this rationally one has to accept this reasoning . <\s>
<s> If the kids wo n't be good in school because they give to much to community they wo n't be able to go to halfway decent university and thus wo n't get a good job - which is still one of the most important things to get ( not only in young peoples eyes ) . <\s>
<s> And after all , do older people really give a lot time to the community . <\s>
<s> Well I do n't think so . <\s>
<s> Adults also try to make career and try to get the best possible outcome for themselve . <\s>
<s> So to whom could young people look upward ? <\s>
<s> So I conclude that it 's not the young people who should give more of the time to their community , it 's everybody . <\s>
<s> The acquired , traditional structures of communities are valauable and at some situations in life everybody will remark that he is needing them . <\s>
<s> So everybody should invest a bit more in them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But are young people really as individualistic and profit orientated as put forward above . <\s>
<s> I think there are good reasons to doubt this claim . <\s>
<s> One can observe an important backflow to traditional values within the group of young people . <\s>
<s> Nowaday younger people do become involved in social activities - or how could one explain the rise in numbers of NGOs . <\s>
<s> And what about the large number of young people volunteering in social projects in underdevelopped countries ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If young people are thus not giving enough time to their communities maybe these communities should think of changing their offers in order to attract young people . <\s>
<s> Young people are surely willing to give their time to the community . <\s>
<s> To conclude I think one has to state that one should not blame the young people rather the communities for not adjusting to the young . <\s>
<s> Most people like doing what they are used to , what they have learned from their family and society over the passed years . <\s>
<s> This is a good way of living to avoid making any mistakes , and to keep things the traditional way . <\s>
<s> But the trueth is , only a few people are the ones that take risks in life and make a difference . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People openminded , who enjoy exploring and trying new things are the ones who take risks , encourage themselves to try uncommon things and see things in another perspective . <\s>
<s> This kind of people most of the time find success ; however , some find may it after their death . <\s>
<s> An example of this would be the famous artist Vincent Van Vough . <\s>
<s> He was a pioneer in a new painting technique ; he was a great paintor whose work did not have much importance when he was alive . <\s>
<s> But it was after his death that his work rechead the value it had hidden , and it became famous . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An example of a successful person who had reccodmission while alive was the Pope John Paul II . <\s>
<s> He was a brilliant man , that accomplished to do many activities that were not tipically done by a Pope . <\s>
<s> He was the first one that have ever gone to almost every country in the world and he spoke several languages that helped him through all his trips . <\s>
<s> His charisma was unique , and because of this characteristic he could stablish a sense of brotherhood between Catholics and other religions members . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people are also good role models , not only for young people but to adults too . <\s>
<s> They show another way of living , probably a more difficult one , but its results are not represeable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe that not all humans are destinated to have success , but everybody can try new things . <\s>
<s> It just needs determination and hard work . <\s>
<s> Many people travel around the world in different ways . <\s>
<s> And it is true that one of the best ways to travel is going in a group which is led by a tour gide . <\s>
<s> However , I strongly disagree with this way of traveling . <\s>
<s> I prefer the way traveling by myself . <\s>
<s> And there are several reasons for my way of traveling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , if I travel alone , without guide , I can experience more valuable things compared with guide traveling . <\s>
<s> I agree that traveling in a group led by a guide is convenient and can visit well-known places quickly . <\s>
<s> However , while traveling with tour buses you just take pictures or walk around places . <\s>
<s> You do n't really have free time to experience something spcial . <\s>
<s> As the schedule is too tight , you will just look around many places . <\s>
<s> If I travel alone , however , I can spend my time freely and experience something unique . <\s>
<s> For example , when I was traveling Malaysia , I actually stayed with native people . <\s>
<s> Eventhough we could n't understand throughly , we could become a good friend . <\s>
<s> From there I could experience the way of the native people 's life . <\s>
<s> It was an unforgettable experience in my life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Next , most people thinks that traveling with a tour guide will be cost effective but this is not true . <\s>
<s> If you travel alone you can actually save more money . <\s>
<s> As a tour is operated by a guide company , the company tries to get more profits . <\s>
<s> So they increase the traveling fees . <\s>
<s> Two years ago , I actually wanted to travel Japan by a tour guide company . <\s>
<s> But before I book I checked how much money will cost for the traveling by using the internet . <\s>
<s> And it was surprising that the fee which the guide company suggested was two times hire than original cost to tavel . <\s>
<s> So traveling with a tour guide is totally not cost-effective way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the guide traveling is sometimes needed to travel certain places such as Alaska . <\s>
<s> But in my opinion , traveling by oneself is the best way . <\s>
<s> Because it gives you much experience which is unforgettable and you can save a lot of money . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more that older people do '' because the young people will be more active , fast thinking , no tension about the family and the future and emerging of new cultures and technologies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , young people will be more active and fast thinkers than old people because they will believe that `` Time is precious '' i.e .. , once the time and age is gone they cant get bact it to enjoy and correct the things according to them . <\s>
<s> But the old people will be very slow in taking decisions and theey will very superstitious . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , younger people will not have any tensions about the future and family problems because they will think that there will be lot of time to think about the family . <\s>
<s> But old people will think about the problems of the family members and they will take it as a responsilibity to solve the problems and giving good future to their family members . <\s>
<s> For example , if there is any financial problem then young people depends upon the old people to solve that financial problem and they will concentrate on other things which gives free from tensions . <\s>
<s> Hence younger people gets more time to enjoy the life than older people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , younger generation experiences different type of enertaining cultures and tecnological events to adapt to it and gaining pleasure and happiness from it . <\s>
<s> As the older people belongs to older generation they cant adapt the new cultures and they continue to live in the old manner . <\s>
<s> For example , younger people go to the different types of movies , functions and other entertainment technicques to make them enjoying the life and fell happy but older people cant show much interest on that events . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I conclude that younger people will enjoy the life than the older people do because of the interest shown by the older people , emerging of new cultures and using new technologies to lessen the burden , fast thinking and no tensions about the family problems . <\s>
<s> They also avoids problems by knowing the experiences of the older to people . <\s>
<s> I do agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having broad knowledge of many academical subjects offers the student to conceptualize a wider range of subjects and information from the world that surrounds them ; students that get broad knowledge , knows where to get whatever information they need under a given situation that might raise in their professional life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students gets during their academic studies , information about bibliography reference , knowing where to look for a broader set of issues than whose specialized for just one thing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The brain can hold a limited quantity of information . <\s>
<s> From every day 's life , we aquire huge quantities of it . <\s>
<s> When specializing in one specifical subject , if we dont usually practice it in a daily basis , we might tend to forget about important things related to that specifical subject we 've been prepared for . <\s>
<s> Although with broad education , students would tend to forget even more than with specialized education about all the different subjects , they get to conceptualize the most important basics of each . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even if specializing into specifical subjects can maximize how a person will solve a problem , and give an indepth analisys in his own area , if his professional area becomes obsolete by any reason , ( technological means , substitute activities ) they then become obsolete for working in different areas . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can also add another reason that is ; what if the professional becomes tired of working in the field he academically specialized ? ... <\s>
<s> Would have to get academical studies again in a different professional area ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In example of this , if someone whose grade has been into the telecommunications field , and there one day gets tired of working in telecommunications , routers , switchs , commands ! , he or her becomes practically doomed to keep working in that they specialized for , for the rest of his or her days . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Instead , if the student chooses Computer Science , there is a much wider range of possibilities . <\s>
<s> He 's able to develop systems in whatever area he wants to work for , including telecommunications ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From a social point of view , specializing into one specific subject might lead to isolation . <\s>
<s> This can happen in ways that the person gets so specialized into something , that knows nothing about the rest of humanity ; gets not much to talk about , or even understand basic fundamentals of different areas . <\s>
<s> Making products look more and more appealing is the very purpose of advertisement . <\s>
<s> It is the proper of our modern society to make people eager to buy more and more things , even if they do not really need them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To me , if people who are totally aware of the fact that they live in a consumerist world , keep on buying stuff , that must be because advertisements are really efficient and do make products seem better than they are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> According to adds seen on television , a car can make us discover a whole new world of pleasure or a cheese can be of great help for a shy girl to get the man of her dreams . <\s>
<s> Plenty of other examples are even more astonishing , and yet people would buy those products . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is not that I personally think that people are stupid enough or not independent enough to actually believe those lies ; I tend to think that it is rather because a positive image is enough for a brand that would already offer high quality products to expand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I must admit that I am tempted to buy lots of new , exciting things , as much as anybody else , just because they promise me more than what the previous products can . <\s>
<s> It can be a pleasure for me to go to the mall or wherever I can do some shopping , just to see what is new . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , when the advertisememt somehow managed to convince me , I would buy something ; but most of the time I do not , since I cannot afford and even refuse to buy totally unuseful things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Digital technologies also helped making products look way more attractive tthan they really are : in the media , pictures shown on television as well as those printed in magazines do not reflect the reality at all , since they are previously reshaped on a computer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although I do believe that advertisements are really good at making things look fantastic , even if [ I could even say especially if ] they are not , I reckon it is people 's duty to be carefull . <\s>
<s> It can be ve <\s>
<s> I could not agree more with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> I believe that people should have knowledge in many areas because we face many problems and many situations through our lifes and if we have no idea about them we could face big problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am studying mathematics and I am learning everything about this subject at the university . <\s>
<s> However beside this subject I am attending many other courses to improve my knowledge in other subjects such as english , history , education and international relations . <\s>
<s> I am taking this courses because I will be a mathematic teacher after my graduation and I will teach children . <\s>
<s> My main subject will be mathematics in my job of course but children will ask me many questions in other subjects , too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example they will see something on television and as a teacher I will be supposed to have knowledge about what they saw and they will ask me some questions . <\s>
<s> If I can not answer them in many situations they may loose their trust in me and this is a very bad situation for a teacher I think . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another thing is that I am thinking about staying at the university as a teacher and in Turkey one has to take some exams to be able to stay at the university and to be an academic teacher . <\s>
<s> To be successful in this exams I have to have ideas about some other subjects besides my major subject . <\s>
<s> To improve my knowledge in this subjects I have to be interested in them because it can be boring for me if I have to study something that I do not like and do not want to study . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , because of this reasons I have mentioned above I am taking many other subjects besides mathematics to improve myself and I believe this will help me to be successful in my job in the future . <\s>
<s> Are young people happier than older ones ? <\s>
<s> I think that this statement is the sad reality . <\s>
<s> We 'll quickly see the arguments on the paper <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , young people have much more occasions to make new friends than old people . <\s>
<s> If you go out every week , if you 're invited at your friends ' places twice a week , your chances to meet new people are amazingly high . <\s>
<s> The truth is that you only can and want to have this kind of life when you 're relatively young <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides as a young personn you are not as involved in your family life as your parents might be . <\s>
<s> You can spend the time you want with the people you really care about without thinking about the duties you need to do back home . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Studying abroad is an opportunity you ca n't miss . <\s>
<s> With the increase of links between the earth nations it has became easier to study abroad than before . <\s>
<s> As a result , today students have much more chances to go in a foreign country than their parents had . <\s>
<s> Proof of this point the increasing students demand for the erasmus program and the strong relationships that universities maintain together . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but not least , old people have to work and secure an income to make sure that their family could live safely . <\s>
<s> It 's not the case when dealing with young people that can do whatever they want as long as they are good at school at the end . <\s>
<s> A young guy can relax as much as he want . <\s>
<s> He even can leave school if he does n't like it . <\s>
<s> An adult can not afford it . <\s>
<s> He can not chill out because someone is counting on him : The young personn . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I would like to say that we mus n't be blind , There are too many arguments in favour of the point supported in the paper and so few for the opposite point that the answer should be obvious . <\s>
<s> Life is better when you are young . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> When we look around us , we can easily see that people we define as `` successful '' are generally the ones who have and eclectic knowledge on subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a high school senior who is in the process of apllying to colleges , I 've realized the importance of being a well-rounded person even . <\s>
<s> Colleges do n't just want kids who have great SAT verbal scores ; you have to get a high score on the math section of the test as well . <\s>
<s> If you want to guarantee your spot in the admissions , you better be ready to take a shot on the SAT subject test . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The people who earn the most money , according to some surveys , are bio-medical enginners . <\s>
<s> Have you ever thought why ? <\s>
<s> They not specialize on medical subjects but also are experts on engineering . <\s>
<s> Or even doctors . <\s>
<s> It 's not enough for them to specialize on biology , or anatomy ; they have to learn a wide range of subjects of they want to become successful in their professions . <\s>
<s> Also if you have a wider knowledge on things , you can have more options to choose from in your life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The human brain never fails to amaze me . <\s>
<s> I 've experienced that as you put more knowledge into your brain , it just starts wanting to absorb more and more knowledge . <\s>
<s> It never gets enough . <\s>
<s> Even if one believes that specializing in one specific subject is better , they should start by trying to gain a broad knowlede on things , because it will make it easier for their brain to understand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Everything happening in this world is related to another somehow . <\s>
<s> It is hard to specialize in physics , for example , if you do n't have much of a knowledge in mathematics ; which makes me start to think that it is `` necessary '' to have a broad knowledge of many subjects `` even if '' you want to specialize in one subject . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is to tell whether there will be fewer cars in use twenty years later than there are today . <\s>
<s> This question is very crucial in judging the amount of travel infrastructure ( like roads , fuel etc . ) <\s>
<s> and car production required in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe the number of cars in use is going increase over the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> There are several factors that hint this change , the most important being poulation rise , rise of developing nations , increasing lifestyle requirements of people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the world poulation is on a rise . <\s>
<s> Human poulation on our planet has shown significant growth rate in recent times and there is no reason to believe this pattern will subside in the near future . <\s>
<s> So , twenty yers later , there will be more people , implying usage of more cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another important point to note is the present economic improvent in highly populous nations . <\s>
<s> For example , it is worth noting that China constitues one-fifth of the worlds population and India constitutes one-sixth . <\s>
<s> Also to be noted is the rate at which these two nations are advancing economically , which is slated to sutain over the next two decades , if not increase . <\s>
<s> They are moving from a state of high poverty percentages to prosperity . <\s>
<s> As they improve , more and more people in these areas will be rich enough to afford a car . <\s>
<s> Thus , we can expect many new cars in these nations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , regardless of nationality , the world is getting busier . <\s>
<s> People are running against time . <\s>
<s> They do not want to compromise their time for anything , let alone using public transport when they can afford a car . <\s>
<s> Thus , we can safely assume that increasing lifestyle demands of people will result in an increase in the number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus I have enough reason to belive that there will be a lot more cars in use two decades later than there are now . <\s>
<s> That could mean that drastic steps will be required for finding enough fuel for these cars , among other issues . <\s>
<s> I completely agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Although I can not be one hundred percent positive about this fact I think there is a clear trend towards reducing the use of cars in our society . <\s>
<s> I must admit that I completely support it There are several reasons that support my opinion . <\s>
<s> First , there is an evident increasing trend in terms of transport diversification that has a direct impac in the reduction of the use of the car . <\s>
<s> Tube , aeroplanes , urban buses , fast trains ... <\s>
<s> are new ways of transport addressable to the public that did n't exist before . <\s>
<s> When my parents were young going from Madrid to Barcelona on a plane was unbelievable as there were just one flight during the day and they were extremely expensive . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , with the drop in prices of flight tickets , nearly everybody can afford it . <\s>
<s> The same happened with the tube . <\s>
<s> In the past , just a few cities had tube systems whereas currently , most cities have underground or are planning to open it or increase the number of lines Second , Governments from most countries and the European Union institutions are continuously encouraging the Public Transport and the fewer use of cars . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , this is considerably reasonable taking into account the pollution that cars generate , the congestions and the high number of cars accident . <\s>
<s> For example , in some cities as London , Frankfurt , Rome , etc ... <\s>
<s> to access to the city centre , citizens have to pay a certain amount of money , which clearly show the Government willingness to reduce the number of cars Third , as new communication systems develop ( Internet , mobile phones ... ) <\s>
<s> the need to actually move from one place to another ( let 's say for a meeting ) reduces and the need to use cars reduces as well For all the reasons explained above I think that there would be fewer use cars in use in the future . <\s>
<s> Big car manufacturers as Toyota , Ford or Mercedes ... <\s>
<s> will have to struggle in the future in order to achive good economic performance . <\s>
<s> I am pretty sure that they will try to encourage the car sale offering attractive discounts etc ... <\s>
<s> but I do not think that they will be able to stop what it 's already an increasing tremd <\s>
<s> Yes , i strongly agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Many companies use this technique in-order to increase their selling quantities and so higher profits . <\s>
<s> Advertisements in their nature purposes to be so , as they should appeal to the people in the most attractive manner , specially when the advertisment deals with products associated with teenagers . <\s>
<s> Advertisments can be false either when it atempts to use inaccurate and exaggerated information or when it states facts about a product that are in-fact not true . <\s>
<s> Almost any country has laws and punishments concerning about such issues . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I can easily give supports and examples from our daily exposure to such advertisements , for example : the Orbit Channel advertisements ; the one related to the chemical hair remover `` Epil Stop '' . <\s>
<s> The advertisement says that the solution removes the hair from its roots and in few minutes . <\s>
<s> We bought the product for my mom , and she tried it , but it appeared that the solution is unable to remove the hair from its roots , however , it just wipes the hair at the surface level . <\s>
<s> Another example is the advertisement for milk , protein products , or energy drink . <\s>
<s> As the person in the advertisement shows a specially supernatural powers immediatly after drinking it , like winning in a running race , flying , or being able to get good grades . <\s>
<s> Another example is advertisments for certain cars , like the one for Chevorlete , when the driver of the car stops immediatly to avoid killing an animal , while in a very short ( phyisically impossible ) stopping distance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisements are always exaggerated in way or another ; thats the nature and the philosophy of the advertisement . <\s>
<s> But exaggerations should be limited . <\s>
<s> Sometimes such exaggerations might be constructive , as in the case of the milk advertisment , as it encourage kids to drink more milk . <\s>
<s> However , it might be in some cases disadvantageous , as it would be a waste of money , as in the case of the hair remover . <\s>
<s> Traveling with a tour guide is far more efficient than traveling alone . <\s>
<s> Arriving in an unknown location may cause nerves or ultimatley , get one lost . <\s>
<s> When one travels in a group with a guide , one is able to obtain much more background information than by bieng alone . <\s>
<s> This information will make every penny worth 's while . <\s>
<s> In addition , being with a guide can also mean safety . <\s>
<s> A guide is an experienced professional that knows where and when to take one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Getting off of the plane and wondering where to go can be frustrating . <\s>
<s> People that undergo this frustartion may even become so distratced as to leave thier luggage behind . <\s>
<s> Also , when one arrives , one is not sure exaclty where to go and by which means . <\s>
<s> If one gives a taxi driver the wrong address , one will be having to spend one 's money and time . <\s>
<s> All this precious time that could be spent in viewing new places , is spent in figuring out how to get to the hotel or guessing the locationin which one is in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> After being able to arrive to the hotel , and ready to extract the essence of that place , one is not sure of what that means . <\s>
<s> Most of the time , when being in an unknown country , one is not completey familiar with the native language . <\s>
<s> It is extra difficult to communicate or express one 's thoughts . <\s>
<s> Finally , in the museum , taking pictures of the beautiful arts , one begins to think of what it is or who has done it . <\s>
<s> If one had been in a tour guide , one would have learned who has created the masterpieces , what it is , what is its symbolic value or when it was done . <\s>
<s> This information will not sporadically get into one 's mind . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Wanting to retrun from that exhausting trip , merely surving , one gets robbed , cheated on or smuggled . <\s>
<s> Usually , tourists who are not accsutomed to traveling or are not advised , are easily identified in foreign lands face danger . <\s>
<s> Safety is a great issue that foreigners face . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , in order to enjoy the trip , it is recommended to go with a tour group . <\s>
<s> Planning to see fewer cars in use in twenty years is a good perspective but I can hardly imagine it . <\s>
<s> I can only consider it as an illusion . <\s>
<s> Basically , people enjoy driving to go working , shopping or to the beach . <\s>
<s> If you live in a city , I would encourage you to observe and count as many cars as possible for one minute . <\s>
<s> I guess you would be surprised . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It appears to be quite clear that some people really need a car . <\s>
<s> First , a car , it is useful . <\s>
<s> It is useful by the fact that you can get anywhere , at any time , the way you want . <\s>
<s> The only thing that may slow you down is traffic jams . <\s>
<s> And when you live far from any city , any shop , any bus stop , a car is very useful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , a car , it can reveal something else . <\s>
<s> This is part of the thing you can also notice ( when you are observing on the pavement ) , it is the number of people in the cars . <\s>
<s> You can hardly see more than two ( except when it is a family and when they are two children at the back ! ) . <\s>
<s> Yes , because owning a car has always been a sign of power . <\s>
<s> We live in a society where people feel like buying and owning new and often expensive thnigs in oder to be proud of them and expose them . <\s>
<s> People who make advertisements know that and have used this idea so many times . <\s>
<s> And especially the cliche about middle-age men driving a fast and powerful car . <\s>
<s> It is said that you could describe people according to the car they 've got and vice-versa . <\s>
<s> I guess in our current societies , it is a sign of power , of prosperity and modernity . <\s>
<s> And this is not going to change ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And the last but not least important fact it the evolution , over the last years , of the means of transport in any city all over the world . <\s>
<s> Bangkok is a good example . <\s>
<s> The Skytrain as well as the undergroung are sometimes crowded but not so much . <\s>
<s> There are seats available quite often . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The only thing you can notice and you have probably been noticing it for a long time now is that the roads keep being flooded by cars ! <\s>
<s> It may be better and less than before but before seeing fewer cars in use , we will probably have to wait more than twenty years . <\s>
<s> Many people believe that professionals need to specialize in one specific subject in order to succeed in their own careers , while others are convinced that the broader knowledge you have , the better . <\s>
<s> I think that a wide knowledge of many academic subjects is the best option for achieving a successful career . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There has been a long debate regarding this issue and education specialists gather in different conferences to debate about the diverse educational systems around the world , and analyze their advantages and disadvantages . <\s>
<s> The current trend states that in order to gain academic recognition , professionals need to specialize as much as possible in one specific subject ( the more specific , the better ) . <\s>
<s> This specialization implies studying not only a Bachelors Degree on the issue selected , but also Masters courses and , why not , PHDs . <\s>
<s> Following this formula , you could be the most specialized person in the world about one specific area , and you will get plenty of jobs related to the issue . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some oppositors to the current vision states that nowadays , with all the fast changes that societies pass through , people need to be prepared with a wide package of tools and a broad knowledge in order to respond quickly to new challenges and deal with different situations almost everyday . <\s>
<s> That 's why they suggest that having as much knowledge as possible on different academic areas would help a lot in achieving a successful professional career . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I personally agree with this second point of view and with all the reasons stated to support it , and I could give some concretes examples about my personal experience in my career that could help to better illustrate my position . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even though the first career that I studied was journalism , after that I decided to enroll in a wider subject and I studied Sociology . <\s>
<s> That second Degree gave me a much broader approach to social sciences and helped me to get better jobs , because now I could work not only as a Journalist , but also as a Sociologist , and both areas complement each other during my daily routine . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I would say that learning as much as possible about many different topics could help people building a successful professional career but , most importantly , could make them grow as human beings , while learning new and diverse things every day . <\s>
<s> In wealthy regions of the world , it is common that a typical family has more than a car per person . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , especially when I am stuck in the traffic , I wonder if this situation will ever change . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I strongly believe that in twenty years the number of cars will decrease deeply . <\s>
<s> And there are mainly two reasons that convice me contending that . <\s>
<s> Firstly , enviromental protection is becoming a topic of paramount importance in governments policies . <\s>
<s> Many people 's health has already been negatively impacted by the polluting effects of a too heavy circulation . <\s>
<s> Therefore people are a lot more concerned in the prevention and limitation of this problem . <\s>
<s> Public transportation is generally considered to be the most effective solution and car users seem more and more willing to take advantage of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , it is evident that having a car ( or more than one ) means wasting a large amount of money . <\s>
<s> It is part of our daily routine reading that oil price has increased once again during the night . <\s>
<s> Not to mention the huge insurance costs and the several and varous types of fees related to the use of a car . <\s>
<s> Last but not least , it has to be taken in account that many municipalities , in order to reduce traffic in the city centers , usually come out with special permits to park in certain areas . <\s>
<s> Such permits are generally perceived extremely expensive by the the majority of the population . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , enviromental protection and incresing costs should convince all of us that a more limited use of cars would be a better solution for everyone . <\s>
<s> Of course , also governments and educational systems should help , and it appears that they are on the way to sensibilize people to that effect . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> These are the reasons why I am positive that in twenty years it will not happen to me to be stuck in traffic as often as it occurs to me now . <\s>
<s> As the whole world is confronted to pollution , some decisions and reglementations have to be made to avoid the environmemtal destruction . <\s>
<s> Cars are very concerned by these new measures and they are bound to be fewer in twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , the trend , in most cities is to develop buses and subways to encourage people to use it instead of using their own car . <\s>
<s> It has two advantages : the reduction of pollution and traffic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , sometimes , when the pollution reach a certain level , the circulation of cars is forbiden . <\s>
<s> If the pollution continue to increase , in twenty years , cars will not be allowed to enter cities . <\s>
<s> Cars will disapear . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some cities have begun to take big measures . <\s>
<s> London for example rules the circulation in the center of the town . <\s>
<s> People have to let their cars in the suburbs aroud the city and to take the bus . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It can be surprising but it could be the case of many cities in about twenty years . <\s>
<s> However , it still remaims a problem with trucks , we can not ask the buses to deliver the goods . <\s>
<s> Maybe , we can find a solution with new energies . <\s>
<s> Experts say they can produce oil with vegetables but not for the entire planet . <\s>
<s> What about focusing on trucks ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides , most of the car 's companies try to adapt their cars to environmemtal reglementations because they know they are threatened . <\s>
<s> Some try to reduce the pollution produced by cars , other to make them function with electricity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think people have to get used to a new way to travel . <\s>
<s> By buses in the cities , by train to go from one city to another , by plane to travel abroad , by boat to cross the oceans , etc . <\s>
<s> Everything follow this trend : Transports are more and more developped and less expensive . <\s>
<s> Look at the buses : they can bring you everywhere <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude I do not expect a great futur for cars . <\s>
<s> Behaviours are starting to change : people travel a lot more by train than they used to . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement because I do n't think two people 's experience of joy of life can be compared , be they young or be they old . <\s>
<s> But I would like to consider this intriguing question by looking at the development of my person enjoyment of life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From my own experience of now 32 years in this life , I believe that the quality of life 's experience changes over time even for a single person . <\s>
<s> Consequently , I enjoy life very differently today than 25 years ago , i.e. some things I found pleasure in as a child are today meaningless or boring , such as hours on the playground , or even repulsive , of which I will not give examples . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Instead , there are many new things I discovered , such as reading books , travelling , professional achievements , making love or meditation , which I would not have enjoyed much as a kid . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides enjoying different activities , the feeling of happiness or joy itself has evolved . <\s>
<s> I recall happiness as a kid as more immediate , combined with less awareness of such a state of emotion , while happiness today is often something I register while enjoying it . <\s>
<s> The intensity of either kind of happiness can be overwhelming , while each feeling corresponds to the degree of maturity I have reached . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are some things I fear will get lost will growing old , such as curiosity , spontaneity , mental agility and physical fitness , which I consider important driver of joy in life . <\s>
<s> However , there are some capabilities or assets that I will only have fully developed or built when older , such as patience , more refined senses ( including humour ) , but also family and a strong social network or personal relationships . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Especially friends and family are sources of joy I expect to compensate for the loss of those other springs of bliss which will probably loose importance over time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do n't think young people enjoy life more than old people or vice versa , I think both have to work hard to make most out of it and find the right ways to get the most out of the changing conditions under which we go through life . <\s>
<s> If successful , life can be enjoable all along . <\s>
<s> People who have success in their lifes , very often try to push their limits to the test . <\s>
<s> Having had the sweet feeling of success , they tend to know that else is possible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Like so many people in our material society , they first wanted to have success . <\s>
<s> So , success automatically comes along with money or respect . <\s>
<s> Being an individual member of this society , but still seen as someone special because of his achivements , the successful man ( or woman ) tries to stay on top , proving to himself and the mass that he could achieve everything , being someone special . <\s>
<s> So , the things he used to do are n't so special anymore , what means that there must be new , more exciting challenges waiting . <\s>
<s> So , knowing that he is a `` winner '' , the successful man has the power ( wherether it is money , influence or popularity ) and can do what he plans , which is giving him the kick he needs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think you could compare successful people with junkies . <\s>
<s> Not in a selfdestructive way , but in the way they always need more and more to be satisfied , which is a phenomena that can be proved by looking at the worlds ' top managers nowadays . <\s>
<s> Earning more in one month than an average worker would earn in one year , still not satisfied and greedy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I have the opinion that successful people often do not specifically realize that it is greed , what is driving them to push their limits . <\s>
<s> They tend to ignore that fact and take risks more easily than a `` normal '' person would do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end , I do n't agree with the statement above , for I think that trying new things and taking risks is just a needed prove for these people , that no matter what they do , they will always be someone special . <\s>
<s> These people are just bored by what they achieved so far and need to find something more satisfying for theirselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But everyone for himself is special , so there is no need for taking the risk to prove it . <\s>
<s> The advent of cars added an entirely new dimension to travelling , an essential facet of man 's eternal urge to explore . <\s>
<s> In the beginning , cars were affordable only by the wealthy and hence came to signify financial/social status . <\s>
<s> Soon , with advances in technology that aided bulk production , the concomitant evolution of production design and streamlining of factory production , the costs of cars dropped and came to appear in not so rich households . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the present day , if not for cars , it is difficult to even imagine taking a peaceful and private family holiday . <\s>
<s> The degree of freedom cars provide can not be paralleled by today 's public transportation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today , with more under-developed and developing countries than there are developed countries and assuming that living standards throughout the world only improve ( of course precluding the possibility of another World War in the coming 20 years ! ) <\s>
<s> and since cars are considered an essential indication of a healthy income , it is perhaps not unreasonable to claim that the number of cars worldwide will only increase in the coming few years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From the above reasoning , one may be tempted to conclude that the number of cars will definitely increase with time had the environmentalist not interfered ! <\s>
<s> Global warming has drawn more attention and concern than ever before in the history of the modern world . <\s>
<s> The ever deepening lament by environmental scientists that the world is heading for a doom unless we change our ways in a drastic manner , has now begun to feel the ears of world leaders . <\s>
<s> One of the steps that would be contemplated on is a drastic reduction in petroleum vehicles which , in today 's world , translates to reduction in the total number of vehicles ( as more than 90 % of today 's vehicles are powered by fossil fuels ) which inturn translates to a reduction in the number of private vehicles , i.e. cars . <\s>
<s> There are already governments which are actively encouraging their civilians to take public transit . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One may give yet another counter argument to the above logic . <\s>
<s> How about ` green vehicles ' which run on natural gas which is proven to cause very little or no harmful emissions and also is cost effective ? <\s>
<s> The government of Delhi , India , has recently enforced a legislation that requires all public vehicles to use natural gas . <\s>
<s> It will not be surprising if this extends to private vehicles soon . <\s>
<s> This seems to balance the decrease in the number of cars proposed in the previous passage . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Supposing that all of today 's cars have been converted to use only natural gas , how about the ever increasing traffic congestion ? <\s>
<s> This definitely is not alien to any Manhattan or a New Yorker ! <\s>
<s> One possible solution is to literally force everybody to use public transit , ofcourse not without strengthening the existing facilities . <\s>
<s> In light of all the arguments we have seen till now , it is perhaps too naive to conclude either way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence , I disagree with the statement : ` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ' . <\s>
<s> The correct answer is ` One cannot predict' <\s>
<s> Whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or being specialized in one specific subject also benefits the society . <\s>
<s> The society requires both types of scholars to develop smoothly . <\s>
<s> I think that being broadly trained and specialized also depends on the personnal ability . <\s>
<s> What level you are educating is additionally a concerning issue for such consideration . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Our society needs specialists such as engineers and doctors as well as broad trained people , politicans for instance . <\s>
<s> All of them have their special roles in the society and the society would become choatic without either of them . <\s>
<s> Of course engineers and doctors could only be specialized in one subject as they are the experts in their fields and they should then spend all of their time on their specialized subjects . <\s>
<s> However , for politicans , many of them are rather broadly trained in several subjects including economics , history and languages so that they would be able to know what the residents want and how to promote the policy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A second crition on being specialized or not is depending on the personnal ability . <\s>
<s> Some people are gifted in certain abilities they should then being specialized while some people learn several different things very quickly , they might then be broadly trained in various academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Education and learning would be a funny process if you realize what your strengths are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , the last but the most important reason for choosing between having broad knowledge or being specialized in one subject is what are your educating level . <\s>
<s> If you are the primary and secondary school students , you should probably have broad knowledge instead . <\s>
<s> A good basic knowledge in every academic subjects is essential for the choosing what subjects you would be learned deeply in the future . <\s>
<s> You could not choose your right subjects if you do not have any knowledge in it . <\s>
<s> Also much knowledge is based on the same basis and theory such as physics is sticked to mathematics , you could not then learn physics without knowing any mathematic equations . <\s>
<s> If you are a college or postgraduate students , you might be specialized then . <\s>
<s> As time is limited but knowledge is unlimited , you could not thus learn everything else in depth in such a limiting time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore there is not absolutely good to choose having broad knowledge of different academic subjects or specializing in one certain subjects , it all depends on the above critia . <\s>
<s> Our society needs different types of people and everyone should have a right to find out any subjects they want to learn . <\s>
<s> A famous man once said , `` from experience , comes skill ... <\s>
<s> yet experience comes from risk . '' <\s>
<s> This means that to obtain skill one needs experience , and to obtain experience one needs to take a risk . <\s>
<s> Therefore To be successful one needs to learn how to take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When a child goes to school , they are taught the essentials that they are going to need in their life ; reading , writing , listening and leadership . <\s>
<s> When this child moves on to high school they are taught specifically what they need to learn to fullfill their ambitions . <\s>
<s> When a child graduates from school they use their previous knowledge to get a work place and a consistant job ... <\s>
<s> then what ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The person has got this far , yet are they truly successful ? <\s>
<s> are they truly at their full potential ? <\s>
<s> the answer is no ! <\s>
<s> one will never get raised or moved up in the corporate ladder if they are only doing what they are told . <\s>
<s> This is because everyone else is doing exactly what they are told too . <\s>
<s> To make ones self stand out they must be able to take risks and put yourself on the line . <\s>
<s> Show the employer that you are willing to do anything for the cause and you will get moved . <\s>
<s> However if you stay put and dont take risks then you will not move anywhere and stay at the same level as everyone else that does n't take a risk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A prime example in history is that of Galileo . <\s>
<s> He took a risk by defying the whole scientific system of his time and saying that the world was round and that the universe was heliocentric ( sun in the middle ) . <\s>
<s> Of course he was laughed at and not taken seriously , yet now students write about him in formal essays such as this one . <\s>
<s> This man proved the whole world wrong simply by taking a risk . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is no man or woman in a history book that is there because they did the ordinary , they are all there because they took some sort of risk . <\s>
<s> To get far you will have to do things you already know , yet to be truly successful you will have to take risks . <\s>
<s> I cannot agree or disagree with the statement as it stands . <\s>
<s> Sometimes innovation and risk-taking is vital to success , at other times it will lead to disaster . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consider IBM 's System / 360 family of computes introduced in 1964 . <\s>
<s> It was intended as replacement for the series 1400 business computers and series 7000 academic computers . <\s>
<s> Until then , IBM had been selling two inherently incompatible classes of computers meaning that it have to give different training for each type of computer and also that parts and accessories were not compatible . <\s>
<s> The S / 360 was designed to address both commercial and academic requirements , making it the all round computer , which is why it was named after the 360 degrees of a complete circle . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , upgrading from a small computer to a bigger one meant that all of the programs had to be written again . <\s>
<s> The S / 360 made it possible for customers to start with a small computer and gradually upgrade to more powerful computers , protecting their investment all the way . <\s>
<s> It was a very risky move for IBM but it worked and made IBM the leader of the industry . <\s>

<s> Others were not as lucky as IBM was . <\s>
<s> Steve Jobs , the man who pioneered personal computers , was so impressed with research in Xerox Parc that he built the world 's first GUI * Graph'cal User Interface ( personal computer . <\s>
<s> The ` Lisa ' had windows , menus and all the features of a user friendy interface that has become prolific with the spread of Windows . <\s>
<s> However it also had a price tag of around $ 10,000 and it failed miserably . <\s>
<s> Steve Jobs went ahead and built another GUI computer which he called the Macintosh . <\s>
<s> That was juch cheaper but made no pretence to being compatible with the IBM PC . <\s>
<s> Once again Jobs had taken a risk and failed to succeed . <\s>
<s> It would appear that taking risks is necessary for success but it is also dangerous . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Doing what one knows best sounds like sensible advice . <\s>
<s> However it shoud be re-phrased as follows : ` Do only what you can do better than the competition ' . <\s>
<s> Just because an individual excels at playing chess does n't mean he could make a living playing chess . <\s>
<s> For that he would have to beat the world champion . <\s>
<s> Only a handful of grandmasters can be successful in making a money by winning competitions . <\s>
<s> This rule applies to practically all sports . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is a not good idea to attempt to do anything without first learning it , or at least displaying an aptitude for it . <\s>
<s> There is a good reason why every profession is in the hand of professionals who have trained many years . <\s>
<s> In some cases , like medicine or mining , people without the right background are not legally allowed to practise at all . <\s>
<s> Taking risks or specialising in certain fields is essentially a matter of common sense and analysing the circumstances correctly . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is , whether students today give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> I believe that given the amount of other , mandatory activities that students are involved in , they are doing the best we can to give back more than our fair due to the society , by partaking in several unpaid volunteer tasks and taking small , yet meaningful measures to ease the day to day lives of the community 's members . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , in terms of education , schooling is a form of giving back to the society , for it provides the knowledge we need in order to pursue effectively any community service we may wish . <\s>
<s> For example , if I wish to help renovate the community church 's walls , I will need a proper eduactional basis with regards to acquiring the required funds , hiring the right people , training the laborers , etc . <\s>
<s> Despite the tremendous workload involved in today 's schools , students are still taught the importance of societal welfare . <\s>
<s> After school programs help students take initiative to improving their neigborhood . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , students today volunteer for several unpaid tasks . <\s>
<s> I personally partake regularly in distributing the community newspaper , for more than the recognition I receive from others , I find pleasure in helping bring them the news they need to be aware of the community events today . <\s>
<s> Also , many students work many hours in local hospitals , daycare centers , etc. to give something back to their community . <\s>
<s> Although the initiative to do so may be to add plus-points to their resumes , at the end , every student feels satisfied and happy to have given back something to their community and asks his/her friends to volunteer as well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , community service does not have to necessarily refer to drastic measures to renovate the society . <\s>
<s> Merely asking a friend or a total stranger to quit smoking , helping elderly citizens cross a street , helping a lost child find his way back home at night are day to day generous actions that go unrecognized , and often do not count as ` giving time ' to help the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , helping the community that helped raise them is an aspect that young people recognize to be essential value . <\s>
<s> They give back to their community in every way they can , whether it be volunteering at a hospital , helping renovate the church , or simply , helping an elderly woman cross the street . <\s>
<s> WHAT WE BUY ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We are living in a world which is highly industrialized . <\s>
<s> This industrialization automatically brings the increase in the consumption - consuption in any way such as cars , clothes , machines , etc. - That is why we also face with the advertisement industry . <\s>
<s> The more we need the material to consume , the more advertised producs we face . <\s>
<s> Thus , those people who are in the business of making advertisements use different types of methods to convince their customers , one is obviously to display their products in a much better way than they are , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with the the techniques used in advertisement making , we generally face with the visual materials on TV or magazine commercials , even on the billboards . <\s>
<s> The product is displayed in a manner where you can really get fascinated that how the material is really impressive . <\s>
<s> If we take the advertisement of a mascara , called X , as an example , we can make the scene as : there is always a very beautiful model who uses X and she could make an imressive effects over people with her glorious eyes . <\s>
<s> An ordinary woman watches this commercial and can not stop herselt to buy a X in order to make her eyes as beasutiful as the model 's . <\s>
<s> However what comes after ? <\s>
<s> The X can not show the same effect as it has made on the beautiful model . <\s>
<s> This is really a basic illustration of how the advertisements sometimes forget about the ethical norms . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand some people claim that this is not true for all the cases , There can maybe some loyal companies which wants to be virtuous towards their customers , but their numbers are really quite limited . <\s>
<s> The main rason for a company to display its product in a better way 's to get profit . <\s>
<s> Most of the companies generally have their specific people and project groups who are responsible of making advertisement . <\s>
<s> Furthermore the company is ready to sacrifice a huge amount of money to improve the advertisements of its producs . <\s>
<s> This is du the fact that they are aware of the future income . <\s>
<s> They know that if they illustrate their product in a much better way by using different techniques such as paying a lot to the beautiful models , the people can consume more then the normal time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , although it is unethical for a company to give a different image of its product , they unfortunatetly imply this method . <\s>
<s> The amount of money they would earn after a good advertisement can block the eyes of the producers / <\s>
<s> Refering to the statement I believe thet it 's very complex to find the real difference between the two of them . <\s>
<s> I have some important reasons to think like that . <\s>
<s> I 'm also student on the univesity actually and my experience is that there are two kinds of students . <\s>
<s> One that not use to go to class and try to study all the book during the week before . <\s>
<s> And second there is the student that always goes to class and take notes so that 's why when he has the exam he do n't need to spent so much time inm front of the book . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , both of them use to pass the exam but using diferrent ways . <\s>
<s> The method of study is as important as the way that you practice to memorice the ideas or facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From my point of view it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> In order to explain this I will give an example . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> - Imagine a situation with a student learning a complex theme of antropology at university four years ago . <\s>
<s> It 's not equal if he had studied the theme by understanding the main ideas instead of learning facts . <\s>
<s> Be sure that he will remember perfectly if he had undestanded the idea during that class . <\s>
<s> I believe that facts are confusing according to my experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclussion , the difference between learning and understanding really does n't matter in my opinion , the important point is that with both of them the student is learning even facts or ideas that he will use on the future maybe working or teaching other students . <\s>
<s> So depending on the study it would be better oin way or the other one the thing is to choose the right one . <\s>
<s> It is quite difficult for me to agree or disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> First of all , it is quite obscure that what the word `` enough '' means . <\s>
<s> There are many young Japanese who help their communities , but whether they give `` enough '' time to doing it depends on the subjective view of how much time young Japanese should spend their time on helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Older generations may disagree with the statement because they may have spent lots of their time in their communities . <\s>
<s> The generations of the parents of the young Japanese of today may think that it is simply impossible for young Japanese to spend their time on helping their communities taken into consideration the ever-intensified competition among the young generations . <\s>
<s> Many young Japanese spend huge amount of their time in both compulsory and private education such as `` juku , '' a cram school young Japanese go to after school . <\s>
<s> Thus , many parents may think that young people do spend `` enough '' time to helping their communities , although they have many other things to do . <\s>
<s> I can say niether that I agree nor that I disagree with the statement , therefore , due to the ambiguous definition of the word `` enough . '' <\s>
<s> It all depends on the reader of the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I may agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Young people may not spend much of their time to helping their communities , probably because there are only few `` communities '' in Japan particularly in large cities . <\s>
<s> Now people move from one place to other places much more often than it used to be , and , as a result , they have fewer opportunities to establish their community itself . <\s>
<s> When there are no communities as such , people can have no time to spend on their communities . <\s>
<s> Thus , the statement implies that young people do not spend their time on helping communities even though there are communities which young people are supposed to help , but they do not give their time possibly because the `` communities '' are disappearing from the Japanese society now . <\s>
<s> I completely agree with the statement you have made . <\s>
<s> The companies make big investments either on research and development or their workers and they think that it is their right to gain economical benefit out of this by means of advertisements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , there are many brands in the market that sell products in the same area of interest . <\s>
<s> As a consequence of this , the firms need to diversify their products among others and they make use of the advertisements . <\s>
<s> Although a product of one firm is n't good enough and well qualified , one may be astonished to watch this advertisement trailer on a television and make a decision to buy that product even if he/she does not need it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , in order to persuade the customers that they have the best product presented in the market , these firms invest much money on the production of an ad . <\s>
<s> They work with professionals when developing the movie , hire famous people and celebrities that are appreciated and loved so that these celebrities make the people believe that the product they are presenting has cutting edge quality and reasonable price . <\s>
<s> These people also aim the children and the youth who are easily get affected and have great influence on their parents when they are making a purchase decision . <\s>
<s> These companies have a great knowledge in human psychology so they are trying to do their best to persuade the customers and make their products sold . <\s>
<s> They also arrange some campaings that would attract the people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Next , after your purchase you may see that the product you have bought is not as good as it was seen on television . <\s>
<s> Some firms are trustable and some are not and as a result of this you might feel disappointed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result , companies try to sell their products and make money and the thing that a customer should do is to buy from a trustable company and prefer its products , <\s>
<s> Planning Future Ahead <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> College time is probably one of the most important times in a student 's life . <\s>
<s> I believe this is so not only because we are students and we get our education at colleges but also it is a place where we actually shape our future by making our decisions now . <\s>
<s> Therefore while we are studying at college , we should think ahead and focus on what we expect from ` our ' future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the country I live in , many students takes tha national university entrance exam and after they recieve their scores couple of months after they took the exam . <\s>
<s> Then comes the decision process , in which you are supposed to determine your college and department . <\s>
<s> As we might all guess , a student may not perfectly choose the deparment he wants to be educated in since he is quite young and inexperienced . <\s>
<s> The trend is that if you have higher scores , you are just placed to a college and a department you have selected . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let 's imagine a case in which the student is not satisfied with the department and field he has been placed . <\s>
<s> Since it is not always possible for students to be transferred to other departments , he will probably have to keep on with the field that he is supposed to study . <\s>
<s> However , if he keeps his area of study broad , he can have the chance to study about different topics he has been interested in and maybe he can continue his studies further away in time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The question of whether having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects has also something to do with the year you spent in college . <\s>
<s> For instance , if you are an undergraduate student , it might also be a good idea to study wide range of topics coming from different disciplines . <\s>
<s> This would help you get a better understanding of yourself so that in turn , you can further define what you really want to do in future , whether to study in a differet field , whether to join the work life or to go on further studying the subject in the prospective cycles of your education life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having a broad knowledge about many academic subjects may also come in handy when you are hired for a job that requires you to collate your vast amount of knowledge coming from different areas . <\s>
<s> Based on my experience , I can say that most multinational companies do have this tendency of hiring people who have broad knowledge about many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> These companies believe that they can use the manpower * in terms of intellect * in various areas depending on the time and their need . <\s>
<s> Hence as time goes by , these people in turn can have greater experience on various work-related subjects than their colleagues who have less broad knowledge about these academic topics and become more qualified and desired employees . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , studying wider range of topics and having a broader knowledge of many academic subjects might not be a good idea if you are a graduate student . <\s>
<s> This is because the aim of graduate education is that you need to specialize on one topic of your interest that you can study it throughly , collect specific data and carry out your research based on these gradual steps . <\s>
<s> In the end , you * as the real knowledgeable person about this topic * are supposed to come up with a conclusion that would make a difference in the academic world . <\s>
<s> When we say difference , it is not always meant to be that you are supposed to prove something new , but you can also contribute with your findings - on this very specific subject for sure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , we should be careful about what we expect from our future to determine whether to study wide range of academic subjects and have a broad knowledge as a result . <\s>
<s> Having all these in my mind , I believe that the ideal solution to this complexity will be making use of an appropriate combination of these approaches while we have time and then plan our future studies accordingly . <\s>
<s> I partly agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use then there are today in twenty years . <\s>
<s> I do agree partly with this statement because of several reasons . <\s>
<s> Firstly , we live in a world that constantly changes . <\s>
<s> If I talk to my grandparents or even my parents today , it is astounding how much the world has changed during there life 's . <\s>
<s> This is why I think is likely that this will continue . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Regarding cars it is obvious for me that there will have to be changes . <\s>
<s> For one , the gas is getting more and more expensive . <\s>
<s> Therefore , people have to think about cheaper ways to travel and transport things as well as themselves . <\s>
<s> As a matter of fact , one can already realise the fact that people are trying to use their car less often than a few years ago . <\s>
<s> The train is even used more and the German train company states in its advertisment states that going by train often is much cheaper than driving a car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , it is not only a matter of money , but also a matter of the protection of the environment . <\s>
<s> Even if the gas was not as expensive as it is now , there would have to be a change . <\s>
<s> The air pollution produced by the cars nowadays is too dangerous for all the people living in the world . <\s>
<s> It will and it has already caused serious problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is why I think and why I hope that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are now . <\s>
<s> However , it is an illusion to think that we can live without cars or even with a lot fewer cars . <\s>
<s> People are too used to use their cars all the time . <\s>
<s> This is why there has to be another way . <\s>
<s> The governments all over the world should invest in the discovery of new ways of transportation . <\s>
<s> For instance to use solar engergy to run different cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is why I only partly agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> If the people do not try to find different , cheaper and less dangerous , ways for transportation , there will be no way that the number of cars decreases within in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , I can not really imagine that the number of cars will decrease a lot in as much as twenty years . <\s>
<s> But it could start to decrease which would be a step in the right direction . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , I think especially because of financial problems that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , even if it is going to be hard for most people not to use their car anymore . <\s>
<s> During the past ten year when the whold world has been experiencing tremendous variations in all respects , no one , more often than not , can be ignorant of such a phenomenon that whether young people or the older people are more enjoyable their life . <\s>
<s> Apparently , different people hold diversified views due to their respective angles . <\s>
<s> The complex nature of the above topic requires us to consider it on a case-by-case basis . <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , which one has the most noteworthy advantages depends on the specific circumstances . <\s>
<s> In the following analyses , I would like to reason and point out three conspicuous aspects favoring on my own consideration : nothing but the older people are happier with their life is necessarily put in the first place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , there is an only too indispensable reason worth a great deal to support my inclination , which is not far to seek : old people become more and more aware of the living standard . <\s>
<s> My grandfather is a good case in point . <\s>
<s> He is eighty-one years old but he pays more attention to his life , and arrange different activities everyday , such as playing chess , walking and so forth . <\s>
<s> This case , undoubtedly , brings me a lot of inspirations in this respect : under this circumstance , it is obvious that older people are excited with their colorful life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , another reason that can be presented to develop my propensity centers on that older people are more satisfied with what they have . <\s>
<s> For this point , I can not stop but cite one of my favorite German philopers , Arthur Schopenhauer , ever mentioned : satisfication is medicine of a good life . <\s>
<s> On the contrary , the young people always complain life is not as good as they assumed . <\s>
<s> Especially the young who just get into the society . <\s>
<s> We can build up an accurate picture of implication behind this situation . <\s>
<s> Unequivocally , positive conclusion can be easily inferred from it to support my idear : satisfication contributes much to a good life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but absolutely not least , one more perspective that bolsters to meet my proclivity lies in the fact that the accelerate development of the society , which requires young people to world hard and can not affort enough time to enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> For he standpoint , I prefer to take full advantage of statistical tools to analyze it , probing what we learn the numbers . <\s>
<s> A recent survey by Sina . <\s>
<s> com , the largest portal company of Internet , indicates that the average number of young people have to spend more than eight hours doing their work has risen by 87 % . <\s>
<s> As is known to all , `` No one can deny the truth behind the number . '' <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Admittedly , it may be right young people enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> However , to some extent , this alone does not constitute sufficient support to claim that young people are feel more happy than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To recapitulate , taking into accounts all the dimensions of the issues discussed in the aforementioned analyses , which sometimes correlate with each other to generate a comprehensive and thus more convincing conclusion , I safely draw the attention that not only can older people be aware of the life quality , but also they are more easily satisfied what they have . <\s>
<s> What is more , they have little sense of the fierce competition in the modern society . <\s>
<s> On on account can we ignore the importance of the old people . <\s>
<s> in today 's world , more and more people find success during their lives , however , several causes could make the success of this person . <\s>
<s> it might be the abundance of money , the personal instincs or also , the fact that are constantly creating and trying new things . <\s>
<s> because i am the kind of person who takes a lot of risks , i strongly agree with the statement which said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> first of all , in my opinion , success is depend on the capacity of inventing and creating new things either materials or immaterials things . <\s>
<s> sometimes it is a brand new idea , another time it is a brand new item , and the other times , it is just a way to act . <\s>
<s> but in all this case , the thing that is created has never ever been before . <\s>
<s> although it is not the only reasons that lead people to success , it is one of the main points . <\s>
<s> in addition to the creativity of the person , several factors could entered in count . <\s>
<s> one other means to sucess is the fact to taking much more risks than a common person . <\s>
<s> in fact , the person who want to try new things and to improve the way he lives has a lot more chance to succeed than the person who just does what she knows exactly . <\s>
<s> as an example of that , i could speak about the difference between a machine and a human being that are doing the same movement all day long . <\s>
<s> the machine always does the same act , and does not try to figure out ohow it is possible to do it better , whereas the human being try to increase his ability to do this act . <\s>
<s> in this way , he try new thing and takes risks to improve his way to act . <\s>
<s> he is more successful than the machine . <\s>
<s> for me , those characteristics are the main one that make me do agree with the statement written in the introduction . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> for instance , my godfather is one of the person who reflects completely the fact that success should be in accord to the risks and trying new things . <\s>
<s> since at least a quarter of century , he works for an engineering company . <\s>
<s> he is in the creativitypool . <\s>
<s> he started as a common computer engineer , and now he his the head manager of a team of 45 people . <\s>
<s> he started just with his willingness , and among a lot more other qualities , he started with his own ideas . <\s>
<s> during his work , he talked about that with his collegue . <\s>
<s> those latter made him increase his level inside the society because the majority of his own ideas were right , and efficient for the firm . <\s>
<s> that is why , they all agreed with him . <\s>
<s> now , he is on the way for the retirement , but , however , he is the proof that successful people had better to count on there own creativity instead of counting on the out factors , and also , doing all the time , the thing that they know how to do perfectly . <\s>
<s> no imajination is equal to boringness . <\s>
<s> creativity seems to say modernity , improvment , originallity ... <\s>
<s> success <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> despite the fact that there is a lot of causes to explain a successful person , as far as i am concerned , i strongly think that a person who is taking risks and trying new things is more able to find sucess during his whole life than a person who jsut act as he is supposed to . <\s>
<s> finally , otherwise , success required taking risks . <\s>
<s> From birth to death , life is a precious thing that we should enjoy everydays . <\s>
<s> Older people have probably more things to enjoy life such as time , money and experience but i think that young people have more opportunities to do so . <\s>
<s> These oportunities are for the most important , the youth of their body which can allow them of more activities and the lack of responsabilities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , most of young people 's body are in shape . <\s>
<s> Their muscles and tissues are tight and they have a good breathing . <\s>
<s> This fact allow them to enjoy outside and inside activities or different sports like tennis , soccer or football who requires a good breathing , muscles in shape and a good endurance . <\s>
<s> An other example would be the practice of extreme and sometimes dangerous sports such as snowboarding or skyflying , parachute , a young person is more able to do it than an old person who can be scared to break something . <\s>
<s> All these activities are fun and make you spend a great time , especially with a group of friends . <\s>
<s> An other significant example is the sexually life in a couple . <\s>
<s> I know this matter can be difficult to talk about for some people but i think that it 's still part of enjoying life , especially if you love your partner . <\s>
<s> A young person is sexually more active than an old one and it is also part of enjoying life to have a good sexual life . <\s>
<s> Being in shape <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , the young people do n't usually have any responsabilities such as children , spouse or important job . <\s>
<s> They are free of their movement and can live their life as they intend to before they get stuck in a stable situation , when it will be almost impossible to do so . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> in that case , they are free to enjoy life in the fullest . <\s>
<s> For example , travelling is a good way to have a great time and learn about different countries and cultures . <\s>
<s> Of course an old person can still travel but they wo n't have the same dynamisn if they are really old or the same freedom if they have a family behind them . <\s>
<s> For instance , a child can stop you in doing adult activities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , i think that life is much more enjoyable when you are young for a lot of reasons such as the body 's ability , the freedom , friendship and parties . <\s>
<s> So young people should n't lost time and enjoy life while they can before becoming adults . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> First of all , the techniques used in advertisements such as color , use of cameras , background and a cheerful music create a more appealing atmosphere that induces people to buy that product . <\s>
<s> The advertising companies are very talented to make products look bigger or smaller with clever positioning of the cameras , depending on which of these two are merited . <\s>
<s> Many products are purposefully portrayed differently to the consumers by advertisement tricks . <\s>
<s> Many food items are dyed with a special food coloring that make them look incredibly delicious so much so that even the best cook in the world cannot give them such a look . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> They even create a fairy tale around a product to make people believe in the qualities of the it . <\s>
<s> For instance , many products from cars to perfumes are presented with an appealing feminine figure as if the beauty of the model does indeed convey the beauty of the product . <\s>
<s> So women may buy a perfume not because it smells terrific but because it is used by a famous celebrity . <\s>
<s> The image or the fairy tale created around the product conceals the real quality of it and makes it irresistible . <\s>
<s> The use of famous people can even be very much disappointing for the real consumer because people usually ignore questioning the necessity of buying a product when they see a famous and loved figure using it . <\s>
<s> This phenomenon which could be called the `` the celebrity effect '' is very much responsible for disappointed consumers in the long run . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another factor that hides the real quality of products is the advertisement promotion . <\s>
<s> People start to use or consume products for their temporary benefits such as reduced fee for mobile phones for a limited campaign period but after that `` path dependence '' is created among the consumers and people are used to using that product , all of the temporary benefits are removed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , advertisers are doing everything to create an image that does not quite exist , or exists only partially . <\s>
<s> I think the consumers should go and see the products in real life to make the ultimate decision . <\s>
<s> There are several opinions about knowledge of academic subjects . <\s>
<s> Some believe in that people should learn many of the academic topics and some thinks that it is useless to know many of them . <\s>
<s> According to my opinion , people should have broad knowledge about many academic topics for solving problems , having more information and having options in front of us . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason is people can not know what would they meet in the future . <\s>
<s> Knowledge helps for solutions to the problems . <\s>
<s> For example after graduation of a department , which teaches many academic topics , person could be recruited and in business life that person may meet with lots of problems . <\s>
<s> As said lectures are preparation for business than they would be the answers to the problems in business life . <\s>
<s> So these many lectures , that person got in the past , would be different solutions to the problems because every knowledge would have different points of view . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly specialization on just one specific subject gives us less knowledge . <\s>
<s> This means that we would have a great knowledge about one topic and it may be seem as not bad . <\s>
<s> In my opinion this is not true because usually there are lots of information about any subject and I can not believe that a person may learn everything on that subject . <\s>
<s> Although that person may learn most of the information , he/she can not learn all of them . <\s>
<s> In contrast having knowledge about many topics is more believable because a person can many small things from lots of subject . <\s>
<s> These examples are from daily life but they are all same with the academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly broad knowledge means options in the life . <\s>
<s> After specialization , we would have only one chance which limits people and if we want to be free and independent of anything we should not be specialized . <\s>
<s> For instance if we learn lots from academic subjects , we can easily decide what we will do in the future after seeing all the options lying in front of us . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If we take these things above into consideration , I can say that being specific on one topic is not as good enough as having wide information about academic topics . <\s>
<s> To learn more , we should just study on more topics . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , it would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in a particular subject . <\s>
<s> Two main reasons can be given to support my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , having knowledge about a broad range of subjects widens a person 's perspective . <\s>
<s> In today 's world , we are confronted with many different situations each of which requires a unique way of handling . <\s>
<s> A project about the construction of a bridge can be given as an example to this situation . <\s>
<s> A construction engineer deals with just the calculations required to make the bridge resistant to the pressures of cars and trucks that will pass on it . <\s>
<s> However , there are many complementary aspects of this issue that should be taken into account . <\s>
<s> The financial availability of the project , the environmental consequences of building the bridge there , the possible resistance of people living at that neighbourhood should all be considered . <\s>
<s> If that engineer took courses regarding those issues , he would surely approach the issue in a more comprehensive way which is necessary . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , having broad knowledge of many subjects gives a person the flexibility to specialize in whatever field he wishes to . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately , the best example showing the importance of this includes me . <\s>
<s> I was entitled to register to the computer engineering department as a result of the university entrance exam . <\s>
<s> In the beginning , things went well but soon afterwards the nightmare began . <\s>
<s> I understood that I would not want to be a computer engineer and I had to reenter the exam in order to change my department . <\s>
<s> I had no other choice . <\s>
<s> I was lucky to be able to change my department afterwards but many people in my country can not find this opportunity and this forces them to have a job they do n't like for all their lives . <\s>
<s> Obviously , if students were given the opportunity to gain knowledge about a variety of subjects in their first year in the university and then choose what they want , the problem would be eliminated . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result , acquiring knowledge about various subjects seems better because of providing people with a deeper outlook on events and giving them the opportunity to choose the career that is best suited to them . <\s>
<s> Currently , because of the rising oil demand in the would-be next-gen superpower China and India , there is a rise in the demand of car as well . <\s>
<s> However , also at the same time , because of some futurists ( scholars who `` prophesy '' how will our lives be in the future ) claiming that crude oil will run out in forty years time and the fact that our so-called ozone-hole is getting larger almost by the size of Korean peninula every year , it seems to me that in twenty years cars would be abandoned much more than now . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , there are environmental problems . <\s>
<s> I have seen a documentary addressing this issue . <\s>
<s> Rather shockingly , because of rising sea level ( due to ice melting ) caused by global warming ( caused mostly by burning oil ) , someone in America made an article claiming our planet could encounter yet another ice age in less than twenty years time . <\s>
<s> The fear of encounting constant blizzards that has terrorized earth 's species over time should be quite enough to make people give up cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , unless we have a more environmental friendly and renewable energy source , cars would have to be abandoned . <\s>
<s> Think about this . <\s>
<s> If only oil and LPGs can run our car now , they would become scarce in twenty years time , which also means that petroleum ( including both oil and gas ) price would skyrocket . <\s>
<s> it is already skyrocketing and it will be more severe in the future . <\s>
<s> And we make plastic . <\s>
<s> Plastic come from crude oil , which means that plastic is another reason why we deplete oil . <\s>
<s> So cutting down on plastic is another problem to using oil , and people wo n't really give up this convenient substance . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , and if we are to be optimistic about it , is that we will overcome the environmental and energy problems and have flying machines right up there with skyscrapers that are no longer called skyscrapers because they are common . <\s>
<s> Although this cannot happen , proven by the development speed of contemporary society ( and probably late Stanley Cubrick 's ` 2001 Space Odyssey ' ) , who knows ? <\s>
<s> It might just happen ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So my opinion is that there will be much less cars than now . <\s>
<s> But if we can overcome problems like cars with hydrogen engines exploding all the time and find out methods like how to generate energy from solar battery even if it is cloudy , then there could be many cars like now . <\s>
<s> But because these problems are hard to overcome , I 'll go with the downfall of cars . <\s>
<s> Young people often believe that they have the possibility to enjoy their life more than other can and that the quality of their current life is much higher than it would be when they will be much older . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My opinion is totally different . <\s>
<s> The degree of enjoying your life belongs to your mentality of managing your life . <\s>
<s> That means to manage the good and the bad things that can happen to you in life . <\s>
<s> When people are young they know that they have know more opportunities than a child have . <\s>
<s> They are discovering many new and exciting events . <\s>
<s> And when they attempt to imagine how they can manage all these wonderful things in the age of fifty or sixty , their assumption is that everything would be more boring , because there is nothing new to discover for you . <\s>
<s> To illustrate that argument imagine your first time in the cinema . <\s>
<s> It will never be the same again , even if there will be produced thousends of new films every year . <\s>
<s> But when i take a look at me . <\s>
<s> I see that going to the cinema is as interesting as is was the first time . <\s>
<s> The point is that now my emphasis is put on the new films and no longer on the cinema itself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another strong argument for having a better life as young people is that your body is stronger than it will be in a higher age . <\s>
<s> Thus younger people can make various activities such as sports or adventure trips . <\s>
<s> My persuasion is that when you become older your body looses some skills not from one to another day . <\s>
<s> This is a process of many years and you have time to learn to handle this . <\s>
<s> As your body is becoming older your interests will change . <\s>
<s> While younger people often like sports older people enjoy sports like fishing or going into the opera etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude the previous arguments I would like to express my disagreement with the presented phrase . <\s>
<s> It is up to yourself to feel good in higher age and to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> If you would ask older people how they think about the life of todays younger generation they would probably not feel well of imagining theirself in this situation . <\s>
<s> A striking feature of the modern world is the explosive growth of information . <\s>
<s> We witness a surfeit of information for a wide spectrum of topics . <\s>
<s> These topics are disparate and miscellaneous in nature . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Such a scenario offers ample scope for super specialization in any field . <\s>
<s> Because of the vast amont of information that exists in every topic , specialists who are the masters of that one topic are in great demand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let me explain that statement by drawing an analaogy with a software company . <\s>
<s> The massive demand for specialized engineers in the company can justify the statement that super specialists are in great demand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic fields would still be a more favourable proposition than specialising in any one field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let me justify this belief . <\s>
<s> Consider an investor who must invest his capital in a company . <\s>
<s> Having a broad overview of many issues would enable him to invest wisely . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , a specialist would be bound by his limitation of knowledge in only domain . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , let us consider that software company which was previously discussed . <\s>
<s> Sure , it employs specialised engineers but the employee may actually be a manager who has a broad understandingof various facets of his company and not a deep knowledge of any one . <\s>
<s> And yet , his post is superior to that of the hired engineer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , anyone who is equipped with knowledge of a variety of fields has the potential to try his hand elsewhere if any one venture does not work out for him . <\s>
<s> That gives him the versatility to explore several fields . <\s>
<s> The specialist may not have that option . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today , we see several top companies being led and managed by individuals who may not be specialised in any one field . <\s>
<s> This is because these individuals with their broader perspective offer a multi-dimensional approach which is very helpful for any company 's growth . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The final decision depends on every individual 's personal viewpoint . <\s>
<s> He might derive greater pleasure from complete mastery of any one subject and may prefer being an unchallenged authority on the same . <\s>
<s> I , however , see myself as the manager who ultimately deploys tasks to these specialised engineers . <\s>
<s> To me , the manager 's job which involves being involved with sveral aspects and taking an integrated approach towards decision-making seems more exciting . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> That parallel explains why I believe having a broad knowledge of several domains is better than specialising in any one domain . <\s>
<s> Through an academic training , you usually get broad knowledge of various topic . <\s>
<s> But you can also decide to specialize on a subject that you may be keen on studying . <\s>
<s> To my mind , i think it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have a specialization . <\s>
<s> You can have an overview of many topics and have a generalist training . <\s>
<s> Also , you do n't get bored by such a diversity of subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , having broad knowledge gives the opportunity to learn things about an unkown subject . <\s>
<s> For example , i studied for one year in Grenoble Ecole de Management . <\s>
<s> This first year was very generalist and i could learn the basic principles of many subjects . <\s>
<s> I studied accounting , finances , marketing . <\s>
<s> I reckon that a futur manager must have a knowledge on each of these subjects and master them . <\s>
<s> It ' a condition if he wants to succeed . <\s>
<s> Thus , i believe having broad knowledge is an opportunity to learn more things . <\s>
<s> Above all this diversified knowledge will be useful in the future life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , i think that if you study only one specific subject , you can get bored and became fed up with it . <\s>
<s> Indeed , having a specialization means studying the same subject for long hours in the same day or week . <\s>
<s> Even if it can be a subject you find really attractive and interesting , the fact to focus on it can have negative effects . <\s>
<s> The interest can decrease so as the attention paid to the subject . <\s>
<s> After long hours spended on the same issue , you enjoy tackling another subject and consequently another interest arises . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , in my opinion i think having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial . <\s>
<s> It allows to have a generalist training and to get the basic principles on subjects , useful for daily life . <\s>
<s> Moreover , with such a diversity you are more involved in each subjects and do n't get bored with the training . <\s>
<s> The purpose of advertising a product is to make it known to the public , to claim its benefits and to induce potential customers to buy the product . <\s>
<s> Advertisements come in different forms and through different media : TV , radio , Internet , posters on streets , displays in stores and hand-outs in public spaces . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , advertisments can be targeted to a specific group of people ( women , children , elderly ) or can interest the entire population . <\s>
<s> Whatever the means of the advertisement , an ad wants to convey a certain image and to convince people through wise usage of colors , words , shapes , sizes and people used in the ad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With my definition of advertisment , I agree with the statement saying that `` most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are '' . <\s>
<s> Advertisements usually only display the advantages and upsides of a product or service , and do not show its flaws . <\s>
<s> Even if the product or service does not have any faults , it will mos probably be shown in its best or even enhancing light in the ad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An example that I often encounter is advertisements for low cost flights . <\s>
<s> Web-sites and and airlines companies often advertise very low flight ticket prices . <\s>
<s> However , the price is never what it is claimed to be . <\s>
<s> The prices advertised always omit fuel and tax surcharges , are restricted to specific dates - on which most people do not wish to fly , and often do not allow passengers to travel with luggage without extra costs . <\s>
<s> So even though low cost tickets may seem attractive , they often end up costing the same amount of money as other tickets once everything is paid for . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another good example constitutes fad diets . <\s>
<s> Fad diets are popular diets , followed by many men and women in the US , and are usually advertised through books , TV ads and Internet pop-ups . <\s>
<s> Fad diets show healthy and smiling people eating whatever the diet prescribes and losing weight over short periods of time . <\s>
<s> The ads however do not describe how difficult it actually is to follow that diet , how painful it may be and how easy it is to re-gain the weight just lost . <\s>
<s> They do not either display how expensive the diet is and often do not warn od secondary effects , such as depression , self-image troubles and eating disorders . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequentially , I concur that advertisements are misleading and do not convey the real value of the product or service advertised . <\s>
<s> Even though there is an increasing number of regulations to stop advertisers from lying in ads , customers keep on being lurred by the shining image that ads give of certain products . <\s>
<s> Today the most challenging area in the business sector is ` marketing` , which is how to advertise your product so that it will flourish among the competitive products and then be sold , As the challenge increases , the main actors in the sector try to come up with innovative ideas in order to survive in this cruel world of business . <\s>
<s> These main actors are advertisers , who actually present the product to the comment of the buyer , Through a considerable amount of time , enery and money spent on the analysis of the sector eventually has begined to create its ` own ' marketing strategies , The most tricky and throuhly successful strategy is to introduce an advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are , This method of ` diguise ' brings one of the hottest issue in the sector : Violation of the ethical considerations , Some advertisers and the companies who hire them think that there cannot be any rules for this game , They claim that they do not insist on the customers to buy the product that is advertised with having told that it has the best feauters compared to similar products , So it is up to the customers whether to choose buying the product or not , On the other hand , some companies emphasize the importance of the some set of ethical values that set the sector in a balance so that it will last , Among these two different perspectives , I think the exclusion of ethical considerations would not harm the sector or the so-called balanced , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now , it would be beneficial to grasp an example and see how the two different approaches handle the case . <\s>
<s> Soap is an important product in the FCGM ( Food and Consuption Goods Market ) and probably we are encountering dozens of advertisements on how well ` their ' soaps are , Before going any further , it is incredibally crucial to state the goal of each company regardless of its scale , sector , private or public status : To make profit ; make more money , Remembering this goal , it would be easily concluded that any department in the company seeks to contribute to this profit in a way that department performs , For the marketing department , the way is to advertise the product best so that it will be sold and company will get a profit in return , If you target to make more money , back to example , you have no choise other than selling your soap brand , And if you lack of some quality or price specifications , the only choice to follow is waiting for you : To lie to the buyer ; or in a more kindly way , to exaggregate the features of the products , Any marketing department and advertisers have not the luxury of betraying the ultimate goal of the company . <\s>
<s> So it is extremely logical to exaggregate the features of the products in order to make your products seem much better than they really are when you cannot meet some crucial specifications such as quality which is one of the traits of the prducts customers are seeking to buy , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the ethical dimension of the issue is still a big question mark for those who see the ethical and moral values much more prior and important to making profit , <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it depends on your conscience to lie to your customers or not , I agree that most advertisements make prodcuts seem mcuh better than they really are ; however , due to the reason I stated above , this kind of a marketing strategy just serves to what it is supposed to , If I would be an advertiser and meet a case like this one , I totally go with ` lying to the customer and doing the best for my company` , Besides , I would not be offended as a mere customer and not feel betrayed by the company I trust . <\s>
<s> A broad knowledge of many academic subjects surely has many good aspects . <\s>
<s> But it also has two major disadvantages : it is limited in quality and quantity . <\s>
<s> It is virtually impossible to have a more-than-basic knowledge of very many academic subjects . <\s>
<s> And the more subjects there are you know something about , the smaller the amount of information will be that you have about these subjects . <\s>
<s> However , a broad basic knowledge of many academic subjects is nevertheless very beneficial . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But such a broad knowledge should not be based on the expense of very specifc and detailed knowledge in a particular academic area . <\s>
<s> Our world today is incredibly advanced in all fields of science . <\s>
<s> More progression , new discoveries and inventions can only be achieved by specializing in one , or maybe a few , academic subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If everyone had a broad knowledge , everybody would know the same things . <\s>
<s> There would n't be any experts with specific knowledge that could be further developed . <\s>
<s> Another result of having a detailed knowledge is the ability to work together with people who are specialized in a different branch of science . <\s>
<s> That means that some people with specific knowledge can achieve far more than a great number of people holding broad , but only basic , knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , researchers specialized on cellular structers are much more likely to discover unknown details about cells , because they exactly know what is already known , where there are chances for new discoveries . <\s>
<s> A researcher who is not specialized in cellular structers might very well discover something new , but it is possible that he doesn'r realize that , because he thinks that it is only new to him , or her . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another point is that research conducted today investigates very specific and detailed problems . <\s>
<s> It is thus impossible to contribute to such kind of research with broad basic knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I definitely favor specific and detailed knowledge , but I also understand the value and importance of a broad education . <\s>
<s> This kind of education is especially vital for teaching in elementary school and possible also high school . <\s>
<s> On a university level , however , a specific knowledge is clearly required . <\s>
<s> When it comes to travel , travel itself is not to pass by some places or roads , but to pass the memory of past and to broaden each person 's sight , which is different from one another . <\s>
<s> Thus I disagree with traveling in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Travel with a certain tour guide could make people informed about the facts of touring places . <\s>
<s> But it never makes people appreciate their real values as much as touring by oneself or with a group of two or three . <\s>
<s> I have once made a trip to Seattle , Canada . <\s>
<s> There were about 100 people in my company and several tour guides . <\s>
<s> In addition to the gloomy and murky weather there , what it made me frustrating , there were some restrictions that we , 100 people , should n't do such as going outside hotels and shopping . <\s>
<s> I knew how much trouble it would cause if one person were missing . <\s>
<s> Out of all exciting and curious feeling , it did n't make sense to me that we care and count the number of people missing if any . <\s>
<s> So after coming back from the trip , I had not much memory with Seattle . <\s>
<s> All memories about tour guides incessantly infinite information without moving around freely came up on my head everyday for quite few days . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In contrast to the trip to Canada , only with my sole body and my friends , I have gone to California from Texas where I was living then . <\s>
<s> On the way to go to my destination , Los Angeles , we dropped by Las Vegas . <\s>
<s> Everywhere I could meander was enough to inspire my sense of appreciation . <\s>
<s> Although I did n't come to learn any information about travel place in detail , I was content with even small matter that I learned by looking , walking , and asking if I had any questions . <\s>
<s> After that trip to California , I could not help but thinking about the fun memory and wholesome information I myself had asked ( so never forget ) . <\s>
<s> Moreover I was so thankful for the time and nature , for very little thing . <\s>
<s> I felt I enjoyed so much that I wanted to go again . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is distinct different thing between traveling in group with tour guide and traveling in person without tour guide . <\s>
<s> If I had made a trip twice with exact same course consecutively with a group and tour guide , it would have been boring and pointless . <\s>
<s> The realing meaning of travel in my opinion is when I have refreshness every time differently even at the same route . <\s>
<s> And the real tour guide is in oneself who is capable of seeking for the joy of the travel . <\s>
<s> The main problem with this statement is that its implications cannot hold much factual value . <\s>
<s> It tries to generalize without taking into account the domain of function . <\s>
<s> Different fields of knowledge require different approaches towards specialization in order to be effective . <\s>
<s> I will formulate what I mean by this shortly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion the statement does not hold much water as a general truth but rather depends on the context where it is used . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are certainly many fields of knowledge , where it is imperative to specialize extremly into a the subject at hand . <\s>
<s> Modern science is a good example of that . <\s>
<s> The problem is the speed at which human knowledge expands . <\s>
<s> Thanks to modern storing techniques and exponential growth of `` world knowledge '' it is impossible for a human being to have a broad knowledge of different academic fields and still be effective to the maximum in a certain subjects . <\s>
<s> Thus if you for example specialize in modern mathematics there will simply not enough time to dwell in the escapades of ancient , greek heroes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The main counter argument against specialisation is of course the lack of interdisciplinary thought , meaning a specialist does often fail to connect the findings of his field with discoveries of other fields . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example you might be a person with great interest into the functions and workings of the business field . <\s>
<s> You might want to become a first class manager and thus vigorously invest your time in the wonders of the economic sector . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What if for example psychology discovers a way on how to better influence the opinions of people ? <\s>
<s> Would these findings not help your agenda -- selling your product to your costumers ? <\s>
<s> But how would you know ? <\s>
<s> You never considered to connect the discoveries from one field with the findings in yours . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus molding parts of different academic fields into something better does indeed require a broader knowledge than just specializing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From a personal standpoint , meaning the effects two different alternatives of the statement would have on my personal development as a human being I would like to add : <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If my main goal is to life a healthy , fun , exciting life I do agree that it is more likely that a broad academic knowledge helps me in my everyday struggles more than pure specialisation . <\s>
<s> This is due to the concept of interaction and the fact that human thought does work a lot with association . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This of course depends how much I am attracted to a certain field of knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In Conclusion the only true answer to the statement is : `` It depends '' . <\s>
<s> Its qualities as a general statement are certainly lacking . <\s>
<s> For me , as a student , I often wonder about this statement . <\s>
<s> In my school you often have to learn a lot of facts . <\s>
<s> Especially in lessons like History . <\s>
<s> For example the revolution in France in the 18th century . <\s>
<s> Is it so important to know when every action exactly happened ? <\s>
<s> I personally think not . <\s>
<s> It would be more important for the students to understand how it came to the revolution in France and which consequences it had . <\s>
<s> Instead of learning when the king was killed by the people . <\s>
<s> I experienced this myself in History lessons . <\s>
<s> We had a great teacher who always wanted the students to understand the ideas and concepts of historical actions . <\s>
<s> You never had to learn any dates for tests but you should have known when all the actions had been you are writi Then students would be more qualified for their jobs . <\s>
<s> Because they do not only know things in theory but also can practice it . <\s>
<s> On the other hand you sometimes have to learn the facts , because then you would not be able to understand the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> For example in Chemistry or Biology lessons . <\s>
<s> In Chemistry you could work with a very dangerous chemical substance , with which you could hurt other students or yourself , just beacuse you did not know the important fact the the substance is toxic . <\s>
<s> In Biology it is quite the same thing . <\s>
<s> You are not able to talk about animals in a specific enviroment , like a camel , when you do not know any facts about these animals . <\s>
<s> You would not understand how a camel is able to live in a desert like the Sahara , if you had not learnt facts about the camel . <\s>
<s> For example how it can save water in his body in a hot place like a desert . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion I would say that it is both important for students to understand ideas and to learn the facts . <\s>
<s> To understand ideas and concepts , you depend on the facts you have learnt . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Both sides are linked with each other . <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things I agree that suceesfull people try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s> How do you think all the people you see in newspapers , magazines , television , because of their achievements get there ? <\s>
<s> There are three main reasons why : First because they try new things , second because they never give up , and third they have a positive attitude . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first one is `` They try new things '' . <\s>
<s> As the statement says people with success try new things . <\s>
<s> If you are a person that does n't try to take risks because maybe it wo n't work , you 're never gonna triumph . <\s>
<s> You will be a person that will end up working for someone , probably in a company that has a lot of success , when you can be your own boss by trying new things . <\s>
<s> Instead of going out and find new possibilities to improve your life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second one is `` They never give up '' . <\s>
<s> Of course everybody knows that for you to get to a goal you need to be constant . <\s>
<s> You will fall , and not one time but several times , but thanks to those mistakes you will learn and you 'll make sure not to do them again . <\s>
<s> But you need to stand up again and keep going , because if you do n't , you will never get to your final goal . <\s>
<s> It 's like when you start walking you fall a lot of times , but at the end you end up learning , and walking . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , is the `` They have a positive attitude '' . <\s>
<s> This is a very important one . <\s>
<s> Through out you life you will have to talk with other people . <\s>
<s> To make bussiness with them , to make friends , to ask someone to be your girlfriend or boyfriend , to get something you want , etc ... <\s>
<s> Communication is a very escencial thing in life , and each time you communicate people notice your attitude . <\s>
<s> So if you 're a negative person that 's always stressed out or with an angry face , peaople will not want to hear , make bussiness , or be with you . <\s>
<s> But if instead you are positive , and you 're nice and treat people well , you will succeed in life . <\s>
<s> And even though you do n't believe everything is based in the way you think . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion I would like to say that if we all try new things in life we will be succesful persons . <\s>
<s> Do n't go around life being afraid of trying new things , good things . <\s>
<s> Because you will be privatizing yourself of many things and that can help you be a better person . <\s>
<s> And as I said , everything is based in the way you think , and in the way you comfront each of your problems that life brings you , and if you open your mind to new possibilities you will have a lot of success in your life . <\s>
<s> Quite often management gurus thrust an age old aphorism , `` It 's better to be a jack of all trades , than a master of one '' . <\s>
<s> Ofcourse , specialization is indeed beneficial , however , what 's needed to succeed in this cut-throat competitive world is not just depth but breadth of knowledge . <\s>
<s> From my perspective , a broader knowledge base of many subjects is what I call for and agree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If seen in the corporate context , a typical manager is required to know not just about his immediate area of interest or work , but also about the work assigned to colleagues and sub-ordinates alike . <\s>
<s> For example , a building contractor , today is not just responsible for overseeing the construction part but also various other aspects such as dealing with artisans , wood craftsmen , masons , architect and many other such people , so as to accomplish the set goals wihin the stipulated timeframe . <\s>
<s> Moreover , today students at school are taught how to balance their academic and co-curricular activities . <\s>
<s> Why ? <\s>
<s> Because , this inevitably involves growth and development and better and broader learning opportunities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Gone are the times , when parents insited their kids on becoming a gynaecologist or a paediatrist or an optometrist and started grooming them at a very young age . <\s>
<s> Medicals schools today churn out more general physicians than cardiologists and experts in other medical fields . <\s>
<s> Admittedly , specialization in such fields in the form of Masters is indeed imperative , however , that happens mostly for a purpose of a job or a career to start with . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , as people grow , learn and develop , a variety of skills will be needed to cope with abundant and rapidly changing knowledege and information , especially in this information age . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A broader skill base , is what even professional organizations ask for . <\s>
<s> For them , it 's all a win-win situation in terms of more skills , responsibility and work load in the same cost as for a specialized person . <\s>
<s> A CEO or an entrepreneur would n't have been what they are if they concentrated just on their area of expertise . <\s>
<s> They are master strategists , skilled in various business aspects - finance , accounts , engineering , general management ( a course quite popular in B-schools ) . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In sum , a general perspective and view of things and subjects is required in current scenario . <\s>
<s> People with broad knowledge are more likely to succeed than the ones with a specialization . <\s>
<s> I think that the statement is too extreme to agree with . <\s>
<s> It is true that there is a series of problems involved with cars , for example the oil becoming rarer and rarer and the economical crisis we are experiencing , which should lead to a decresase in the number of cars , but there are many factors which could lead , instead , to an increase in the number of cars in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact , there are countries such as China and India which are becoming richer . <\s>
<s> If a great amount of the people living there wanted a car , the number of cars would probably increase , instead of decreasing in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is true Western Countries are handling the problem of air pollution due to car circulation limiting the number of car actually allowed to circulate in the cities , but Eastern ones most probably have n't already faced this problem . <\s>
<s> So , perhaps the number of cars is likely to be reduced in Western Countries , but not in the Eastern ones . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , new types of energy exploiting are in study . <\s>
<s> For example , electrical or nuclear cars are matters of study of today 's scientists . <\s>
<s> If new energies were discovered in the next twenty years , there would be no evidences supporting the argument that the number of cars would decrease . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , cars corporation could also build cars more appealing to the customers , increasing the number of cars in this way . <\s>
<s> In fact , a car sold toghether with surprising services like the possibility for the non drivers to surf the Internet or to watch television could improve the sellings . <\s>
<s> In conclusion the problem with the lackness of resorces that the Earth is facing is really a great challenge to the number of cars . <\s>
<s> Even the media is raising people awareness of the lack of solution to the oil scarceness human race is facing . <\s>
<s> But there is nothing certain about the number of cars within the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> If students only needed to learn facts , then why come to school ? <\s>
<s> They should just be reading dictionaries and encyclopedias all day . <\s>
<s> But that is not the case . <\s>
<s> We students , all go to school in order to obtain the knowledge and moreover , actually make it `` our own '' . <\s>
<s> If you only learned facts , then what you become after graduating is , a walking dictionary . <\s>
<s> We need to understand the ideas and concepts ; from there , we can be one more step intelligent . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , what is math without understanding ideas and concepts ? <\s>
<s> You wo n't be able to solve problems just by knowing what the formulas are . <\s>
<s> Maybe you could answer ones where you just plug in numbers to the formulas , but anyone could do that . <\s>
<s> What could make you one more step intelligent is knowing `` how '' to apply those formulas in certain problems . <\s>
<s> It is more important , or rather , necessary , to understand the ideas and concepts in math . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , learning ideas and concepts is one of the most efficient ways in developing a creative mind . <\s>
<s> A student will not be creative if he/she only read dictionaries all day , as they will only obtain facts . <\s>
<s> If students are not individually creative , then every student would n't be unique . <\s>
<s> How boring would that be ? <\s>
<s> That is why , teachers try to give us assignments in which we use our minds to analyze and understand specific ideas of a topic . <\s>
<s> The teacher would assign students to write essays , reports , guidebooks , pamphlets , advertisements , posters and many others , in order to be really involved in the assigned topic . <\s>
<s> And that is how , we students really remember what we learned in class . <\s>
<s> By understanding ideas and involving themselves in the learning system , students become creative . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Learning facts , is the way to support understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> It could not and should not exist alone . <\s>
<s> The two corresponding ideas actually coexist to give the students the value in learning . <\s>
<s> Understanding concepts and ideas is learning the `` how '' of things , and valuing the facts you learned . <\s>
<s> And the main and basic goal of learning is to be able to make knowledge , your own . <\s>
<s> Then , from there , we can be more than just a walking dictionary . <\s>
<s> In general , the question whether young people enjoy life more than older people do , is difficult , if not impossible , to give a clear answer to . <\s>
<s> In our family , there are both examples of young as well as older people like my grandmother , who enjoy their life in a similar way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , older people do not have as many possibilities as provided to younger people . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , young people can use internet to read newspapers , check e-mails or watch movies online . <\s>
<s> Or younger people can go abroad on an exchange semester , like I have done . <\s>
<s> All things , which older people have grown up with or experienced before and therefore , are not familiar with . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , it depends more on the personal attitude towards life than on your age if you enjoy life or not . <\s>
<s> My grandmother is a good example for that . <\s>
<s> She is the most amazing woman I have ever met in my life . <\s>
<s> Even when she has to go to the hospital because of her illnesses , all doctors , nurses and patients admire her because of ther constant optimism . <\s>
<s> In her opinion , it is of utmost importance to be active and to be kept informed by reading newspapers , books , and watching television . <\s>
<s> It drives her spirit to learn new things she has never heard of before , even though she is already 80 years old . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is a whole different story , if old people start being confused or do not remember things and thus need to be taken care of . <\s>
<s> For example , my friend 's grandfather was once brought home by the police because he could not find the way back to his home anymore . <\s>
<s> This is the time when being older starts becoming a burden for relatives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it can be said that it totally depends on your own attitude and not on your age , whether or not you will enjoy your life However , it should also be taken into consideration that at some point of our life we might want to enjoy life the same as younger people do , but are not capable of doing so anymore . <\s>
<s> I do not support the statement stated . <\s>
<s> The reasons that support my contradiction are stated below . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars are being manufactured in counts of thousands per day per unit throughout the world . <\s>
<s> Automobile technology is one of the most progressive aspect of today 's generation . <\s>
<s> It has become the basic need of mankind . <\s>
<s> In fact , without the use of automobiles , life today would have been very difficult . <\s>
<s> For public transportation , automobiles are required . <\s>
<s> They are used in transportation of goods from one place to another . <\s>
<s> All basic and essential requirements such as ambulances , fire trucks , breakdown wagons , cabs etc are all automobiles . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It has become a matter of concern regarding the disadvantages and ill-effects automobiles reflect . <\s>
<s> Problems such as environmental pollution , noise pollution and the rapid depletion of fuel reserves are the talk of the day . <\s>
<s> Fossil reserves under the Earth 's crust that have taken millions of years to form by sedimentation and organic decay are being exhausted at an alarming rate . <\s>
<s> An extrapolation from the current fuel reserves indicates that all of the present deposits will be completely exhausted in the next 50 years . <\s>
<s> Then what will happen ? <\s>
<s> What about the millions of cars and automobiles running throughout the world ? <\s>
<s> Will transportation come to a standstill after an estimated span of 50 years ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The answer is a no . <\s>
<s> Today 's world is very advanced in science and technology and this advancement is accelerating at an unimaginable pace . <\s>
<s> Since primitive times , man has always invented ways and methods to enhance and improve things to fit his lifestyle the best . <\s>
<s> So will be the case now . <\s>
<s> Research has already begun in finding alternatives sources of energy that can serve as a substitute for petrol and also keeping in mind the problem of pollution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Man is said to have the most intelligent brain of all creatures . <\s>
<s> God has made the human brain in such a way that it can think , analyze and invent new ways that would ameliorate the ordinary present into a better future . <\s>
<s> Alternative fuel substitutes such as hydrogen power , nuclear power have been a favourite topic in research labs . <\s>
<s> In fact , there has already been a launch of the first water-powered car . <\s>
<s> These improvements will continue and there wont be any decline in the number of cars after twenty years when compared to those we see now . <\s>
<s> In Japan , where I live , many people agree with the idea that cars will reduce in several decades . <\s>
<s> For the following reasons , however , I do disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , there will be no sufficient alternatives which reduce the numer of cars in twenty years . <\s>
<s> For example , sophiscated train systems can be alternatives for cars , but to construct such train systems in the whole world is impossible . <\s>
<s> I live in a rural area in Japan , where there is no railway . <\s>
<s> Since the number of population is not large and the cost perfomance of building railroads is not good , nobody plans to introduce a train system . <\s>
<s> There are many areas in the world such as my town in the world , where the number of population is raising rapidly . <\s>
<s> This population growth will result in an incereasing number of cars . <\s>
<s> This example strongly shows that there will be no alternatives which reduce the numer of cars in twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , cars are very convinient for people to move something or theirselvers , so that people keep using cars in the future . <\s>
<s> For example , people often use cars to move heavy luggage . <\s>
<s> By the way , people tend to live longer , and the number of elder peple is increasing . <\s>
<s> The older a person gets , the weaker a person becomes . <\s>
<s> This means increasing elder people depends on more cars to move their heavy luggage , even in every day shopping . <\s>
<s> The number of elder people in my neighbour who harness cars to carry what they bought in a supermarket is actually increasing and keep utilizing them . <\s>
<s> This example definitely demonstrates that cars are very convinient for people to move something or theirselvers , so that people keep using cars in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , with the reasons and examples I mentioned above , I absolutely disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years . <\s>
<s> I believe that people will use cars in the future , but I wish more ecologic cars would be invented to not pollute the atomosphere of the Earth any more . <\s>
<s> Today almost evey adult has a car . <\s>
<s> Most people use their car eveyday , for essential things such as going to work or driving to a supermarket to buy food . <\s>
<s> A car is an element of daily life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course in cities where there is a good public transport system , people do not need a car for their daily life . <\s>
<s> But in more rural areas or cities where puplic transport is not very effective , there is the need of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Reasons to reduce the number of cars are to protect the environment and the fact that cars and fuel are getting more and more expensive . <\s>
<s> Maybe in some years there are no more as many people as today who can afford a car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand there is the fact that business and working life gets more and more flexible , spontaneous and individal , and the need to get to a specific place in a short time increases . <\s>
<s> And we should not forget the industrial branches that produce cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Weighing these points , I came to the conclusion that I do not think the number of cars will decrease . <\s>
<s> I want to point out that I think it would be a better development for life on earth if there would be fewer cars in twenty years , but I do not think this will happen . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today industry that produces cars is still a growing business , and I cannot imagine that this would change in the next few decades . <\s>
<s> I study geodesy , and something that I could do later is developing navigation systems . <\s>
<s> An example where navigation system are commonly used is in cars . <\s>
<s> Many people and companies work and research for new developments in cars and components for cars . <\s>
<s> So I do not see a financial reason why fewer cars should be produced in twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up I want to say that I would be very happy if there were fewer cars in twenty years . <\s>
<s> The reason for this opinion is the protection of nature and the environment and to reduce pollution caused by cars . <\s>
<s> But I do not think this will happen because business and earning money encourage the production of more and more cars . <\s>
<s> And I cannot imagine that business interests will step behind in favour of environmental reasons . <\s>
<s> Think of a quantum physics professor who joins a reception and is in a conversation with people from very different fields . <\s>
<s> He could be the best in his field , he might have won countless prizes on his theories about quantum computers , but he might look like a complete fool when the conversation is about the ideas brought on by Franz Kafka in his book `` Metamorphosis '' . <\s>
<s> That is , if our professor has focused only on his own subject and left out all the other ones , failing to create himself a general culture . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As I tried to give an idea of a man who has focused only on a specific subject with my example above , I think that one has to have certain knowledge on all fields if he/she wants to gain some reputation among people of the same standard , even if he/she might be the best in his/her own field . <\s>
<s> Although you have to spend most of your time on the subject you are specialized in , in order to be succesfull , the requirements are much higher in today 's world . <\s>
<s> You ca n't just give up on all other aspects of life and isolate yourself from other academic subjects , being a stranger to what the majority of the world is talking about . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is why students are constantly being tested on topics they might not be interested in , nowadays . <\s>
<s> Although cries of anguish like `` When will a person like me who 's trying to become a computer engineer will ever use the characteristic of sonnets ' in Shakespeare 's poems ? '' are constantly being heard in school corridors , it is essential that one learns certain knowledge about every topic he/she can , even if it may seem trivial at first . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This time , think of a quantum physics professor who knows a lot more than only quantum computers . <\s>
<s> Think of a well dressed professor who has something to say , even if it is very brief , on any topic that is brought on . <\s>
<s> Think of how much more he 'll be respected than the ingorant one I talked about at the beginning of my essay . <\s>
<s> Think how much better a society could be even if half of its population consisted of people who tried to learn more on every topic . <\s>
<s> They would communicate in a much complex and in a much more humanistic way than the majority of the world does today , would n't they ? <\s>
<s> Perception is reality . <\s>
<s> This sentence is the premise that makes marketing one of the most profitable industries on our days . <\s>
<s> As we live in a world in which the media controls millions and millions of minds , the more you are advertised the more you can influence the conduct of the market . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the early 1990's , parallel to the boom of mass media , the introduction of the internet and the satellite TV companies around the world started to spend constantly more and more money on marketing . <\s>
<s> Examples of how people 's mind can be controlled can be shown in almost all areas of production , from medicine to food industry , from clothing to transportation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am a medical doctor involved in the cosmetic industry . <\s>
<s> Years ago , surgical procedures such as liposuction or breast augmentation were only reserved to a very limited section of the population . <\s>
<s> This procedures involve several risks such as general anesthesia , prolongued recovery times , allergic reactions and even stroke or death . <\s>
<s> As these procedures started to being advertise in TV shows broadcasted all around the world , such as Dr. 90210 or Extreme Make Over , the number of patients demanding these type of procedures rised globally in a geometrical or even exponential way . <\s>
<s> Paradoxically , the risk factors continue to be the same , but as the procedures are more and more advertised , people often belive that the risks have been diminished . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Same situation happens with food . <\s>
<s> Aspartame is the chemical component of Nutrasweet , an artificial sweetener that has modified the whole food industry . <\s>
<s> Several medical studies were conducted years ago evaluating the safety of the high consumption of Aspartame ; the results were shocking . <\s>
<s> Rats exposed to this chemical compound suffered from Alzheimer disease and several types of tumors ; however , marketing is so powerful that it could overcome the negative campaign . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other examples can be offered and added to the list , but certainly they follow the same pattern . <\s>
<s> Our mind is driven by certain impulses that we ca n't control , and the more times we get stimulated by something the more we get involved . <\s>
<s> Sad , but this is how it works . <\s>
<s> In my personal opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because in a modern world where access to a large amount of information about nearly every subject , problem , or iussue is quite easy to obtain via the internet it should be the main intention of every learning process to gain the skills necessary to deal with this mass of available information rather than simply collect it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First off all , no one nowadays will be able gather all the knowledge of the world . <\s>
<s> The attempt alone seems to be stupid . <\s>
<s> However , in order to deal with all this knowledge and opportunities a student have to develop the ability to select information , to destract the main ideas of a source , and to handle all the useless information . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , one might say that it is easy only to focus on ideas and concepts while leaving out the effort to gain all the information provided related to a certain theory or source . <\s>
<s> This might be true , but the striking point is that only the concept of a theory can be used again on the next source by the student . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , a student is not capable of endless learning . <\s>
<s> When sombody only stores the facts rather than he focuses on the concepts and ideas behind a theory or a source , than the space for other inofmation is filled with all his knowledge about only this source . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Learning is a process . <\s>
<s> You can stop it by obtaining masses of useless information . <\s>
<s> To summarize , the first aim for a student should be to learn about the methods , ideas and concepts which enable him to deal with all kind of problems , sources , and theory which may occur in his future c <\s>
<s> Methods of teaching are essential for the students to learn and understand things and apply those in real life . <\s>
<s> So it is important to choose which method shall be used . <\s>
<s> Indeed , students can be educated by helping them learning about the facts , but would it be enough ? <\s>
<s> Since learning starts with comprehension the definition and essence of things , which are theoratical ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Addition to that , learning about ideas and concepts can improve the students ' argumentative abilities , and lead them not rely on an only one truth . <\s>
<s> Regarding those , making the students learn things by facts does not seem to be an effective method . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Indeed the theoratical concepts can be boring for the students and may cause them to loose their focus . <\s>
<s> But in order to understand and comprehend something , they would need the know the definition and the essence of things . <\s>
<s> Learning facts can be practical but can never provide the sufficient information for the students . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Despite the fact that , learning about and studying on facts can help the students to overcome certain problems that they may encounter , these circumstances are limited . <\s>
<s> If a student 's argumentative ability is not developed enough , then he or she may not able to use the potential creativity he or she has . <\s>
<s> Thus when students encounter events or issues that cannot be explained by a specific fact , they cannot come up with different soultions since they would not know about the essence and the logic of the problem they encounter . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , although teaching the actual facts may contribute to students understanding and learning of things in life , it may help them to a limited extent . <\s>
<s> As long as they are not concerned the ideas and concepts , in other words , the essence and the logic of the things , they can neither develop a more creative and argumentative point of view nor can be successful enough in their future lives . <\s>
<s> I believe that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> In fact , there are only few people who can be considered truely successful in the world , in spite the fact that many people do what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> Besides , it is hard for a person that does what he or she already knows how to do well to be recognized for that reason and , thus , to succeed in the middle of a crowd . <\s>
<s> Finally , some of the most famous successful people in the world clearly illustrate that successful people try new things and take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the one hand , if it only took doing what one already knows how to do well to be successful , many people in the world would be successful , and this is not the case . <\s>
<s> In fact , many people in the world dedicate their entire lives to doing what they learnt through formal education or experience how to do well . <\s>
<s> However , there are only very few truely successful people in the world . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , there are many people who , in spite of having always done what they knew what to do well , have never become successful . <\s>
<s> For that reason , one may conclude that it takes much more than doing what one knows how to do well in order to be successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , given that most people do what they already know how to do well , it is hard for them to succeed in doing so , since they have to compete with so many other people for recognition and success . <\s>
<s> Indeed , it is very difficult to obtain recognition in the middle of a crowd . <\s>
<s> For instance , only very few workers of a corporation are able to obtain such a high degree of recognition from their employers that may allow them to succeed in the corporation . <\s>
<s> In fact , in a corporation , success means being constantly promoted until obtaining a high - or the highest - post . <\s>
<s> Thus , only very kew of the workers of a corporation succeed . <\s>
<s> And this happens although it is very likely that most of them do what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , some of the most famous examples of succesful people show us that they have become successful by trying new things and taking risks . <\s>
<s> Contemporarily speaking , this is especially the case of people who have created and developed new technologies of information and communication . <\s>
<s> The cases of the creators of Microsoft , Apple computers and Google are clear examples of this . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I believe that successful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> This explains that there are only few truely successful people and that most of the famous successful people I know have become successfu <\s>
<s> The argument at hand is whether we should travel in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I disagree with this statement . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , travelling on one 's own is a better choice instead . <\s>
<s> I can conveniently plan my schedule , use my budget more efficiently , and most importantly , learn about the history of the country that I visit . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , travelling alone means that I can have a flexible travel plan . <\s>
<s> I can book my own air tickets , reserve my own hotel room , and decide when to visit places . <\s>
<s> But when I am on my own , I do not have to worry about the needs of the others . <\s>
<s> I can choose my time to buy a cheaper air ticket , and rent hotels that appeals to me most . <\s>
<s> I also do not have to visit places that I am not interested in . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I can use my budget more efficiently . <\s>
<s> If I am to be led by a tour guide , I will have to pay . <\s>
<s> The fee is usually very expensive and will account for a large part of my travel expenses . <\s>
<s> And since the quality of the service provided by the tour guide is unreliable , I think it is a better idea to spend the money on the travel itself , instead of hiring a tour guide . <\s>
<s> With more money , I can go to more scenic spots and attractions . <\s>
<s> I can also afford to buy more souvenirs , and taste expensive cuisine . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , I can fully explore the history of the country that I visit when I travel alone . <\s>
<s> Tour guides only give superficial information about places , and they seldom tell us about the history . <\s>
<s> All they care about catching the coach bus on time , and hurrying places after places . <\s>
<s> When I travel alone , I can talk to the local people , and ask them about the local history . <\s>
<s> This way , I can have a closer look on the historical background of the region , and learn more about its culture . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I prefer travelling alone . <\s>
<s> I can plan my own schedule , utilise my budget more efficiently , and learn about the history of the country that I visit . <\s>
<s> Due to the advances in psychology now we know more about how human brain works ; that is to say , we know how people react , think and evaluate things they see . <\s>
<s> I think that these informations are highy employed in the production of advertisements and today advertisements are as persuasive as they have never been before . <\s>
<s> They can induce you to buy some goods that you do not need or do not consider buying by exhibiting them as if they were much better and more necessary than they really are . <\s>
<s> Because they rely on science . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First and foremost , there are some bugs in the thinking patterns of human beings and advertisements abuse these bugs . <\s>
<s> For example , they manipulate people by using words with positive meanings which have special impacts on your subconcious . <\s>
<s> Moreover , advertisements use some color tricks to persuade you to buy the products they exhibit . <\s>
<s> There are particular pscyhological impacts of any given color . <\s>
<s> Advertisement makers also make best use of these color tricks to impress you . <\s>
<s> Besides , they repeat so-called magic words in advertisements accompanying a vivid tune . <\s>
<s> Once you heard one of such tunes , you sing it throughout the day . <\s>
<s> This shows how these tunes have substantial effects on people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Yesterday , while I was watching TV I saw a new keyboard . <\s>
<s> The man talking on the advertisement was assert that this keyboard was designed very ergonomically and it could ease the pains on your wrinkles if you are a game addicted . <\s>
<s> He also said that they guarantee no disorder for 5 years and a pay back guarantee I you don not like that keyboard . <\s>
<s> There was a vivid song on the background and it was obvious that they were meticoluosly chose the colors . <\s>
<s> Finally I decided to buy it , but I had no need for it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , I think it is unwise to deny the impact of advertisements on people . <\s>
<s> They are designed in the light of latest advancements and findings in the field of pscyhology . <\s>
<s> Today , advertisements are extremely inducive and people are highly vulnerable to them . <\s>
<s> In today 's life advertisements are everywhere , they are part of everyone 's life . <\s>
<s> Everytime we go to a mall , we recognize some of products we see because we have already seen them on a commercial . <\s>
<s> Advertisements play a fundamental role in marketing : they tell people what is worth buying and what not . <\s>
<s> Most of the times the wonderful shiny product we can appreciate on a commercial is not what we expected it to be once we buy it . <\s>
<s> That 's the power of advertising , and that 's why industries would pay several million dollars , for instance , to get a 10 seconds advertisement space during the American Football Superbowl . <\s>
<s> Why would someone pay so much for ten seconds ? <\s>
<s> It 's quite easy to understand ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do agree with the fact that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are , and i think this is quite understandable . <\s>
<s> People would never buy a product which can be classified as `` normal '' . <\s>
<s> People need to improve their life by owning something better every day . <\s>
<s> I believe this is a psychological strategy , and industries do exploit it to make their income grow as much as possible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Sometimes I think that those who create commercials do n't believe their own words , or maybe do . <\s>
<s> Maybe an advertisement is good when its own creator can tell what 's real from what 's a lie . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , advertisements , particularly those based on lies , must not be trusted at all , even though it is also true that the customer really ca n't avoid beeing the victim of this strategy . <\s>
<s> The customer has the right and the need to tell the good product from the bad one , in order to save money and buy what is best for him , not for those who sell these products . <\s>
<s> From my personal experience the best way to travel is not by being led by a tour guide , it 's better to plan your own journey . <\s>
<s> It is true that its not an easy process , but you have much more benefits . <\s>
<s> For example , the money is a perfect factor to talk about . <\s>
<s> Some agencies often charge you to much money to organize your trip , and it could not be a god idea to loose all that money when you could save the 50 percent of what you spent . <\s>
<s> You have different stategies to find solutions . <\s>
<s> For example , involving places to stay , such as hostels that you find in the internet that are cheper . <\s>
<s> The experience is one of the most important elements of planning your own trip . <\s>
<s> The process of making your own desicions and going whear ever you want can become really fun . <\s>
<s> Last summer I went to Europe and went to Spain , France and Germany . <\s>
<s> I organized the hole trip , day by day and it becamed a real success . <\s>
<s> It is true that problems occured during the trip , but I think that those are part of the things that creates the adventure of the experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another factor is that most agencies already have the cities in wich they are going to travell , so you do n't have many choices to explore . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , the liberty of my schedule gave me the oportunity of even going to England for just a couple of days and in a short notice . <\s>
<s> The schedule is led by you and not by anyone else , giving you the liberty in a place whear you had never gone to . <\s>
<s> There is no better feeling than being in a huge place were time is not a factor and liberty is taken . <\s>
<s> In a sense you feel so small and alone in a enormous continent but ironicly you become stronger and bigger as all the experiences satisfy your expectations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So in general I think that backpagging is an experience that every human being must have in his life . <\s>
<s> There is adventure , clueless bahaviours and surprises that a tour guide could not offer you . <\s>
<s> With the rapid development of our society , more and more people can afford travel , whether short-distance or long-distance , internal or oversea . <\s>
<s> But which manner do you perfer ? <\s>
<s> To travel in a group led by guide or travel alone ? <\s>
<s> Different people hold different opinion due to their distinct background . <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , I perfer the former opinion to the latter one . <\s>
<s> My point of view can be greatly substantiated by the following discussion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first important reason in favor of my position is that the tour guides in the travel agent are all trained and know much more information about the resort than any tourists , whether the story behind the scenery or the entertainment information . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the second place , another convincing reason for my propensity is that the expense in group travel will be much lower , due to the scale economy effect in travel industry . <\s>
<s> This point also deserves some words here . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but not least , guide-leading group is also conductive in some other areas , for instance , we will be much more safety in group and can make friends with the people in the tour group , whom we never heard of before . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Admittedly , traveling alone also has undeniable merits , for example , you can enjoy more freedom and more private space . <\s>
<s> But when the advantages and disadvantages of the traveling in tour group and traveling alone are carefully examined , the most stricking conclusion is self-evident . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , due to the reasons mentioned aboved , it is not difficulty to draw the conclusion that traveling in the group led by a tour guide shoud be taken into consideration when people want to have a trip . <\s>
<s> There is not a easy solution to such a complex issue , however , taking into account all the dimensions of the issue discussed above , might be the first step out the dillemma . <\s>
<s> The idea of young people not devoting enough time for the services of the community is really controversial . <\s>
<s> Some people say that young people prefer more of their time towards achieving thier goals in life , while other say that they are really worried about the community and thus they help it by one way or another . <\s>
<s> I believe , however that materialism existing in the world is withdrawing the young people away from the social services . <\s>
<s> I offer following points to support my opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , in this modern era of rapid technological progress their are everyday there is new electronic gadget introduced in the market which provides an effective means of entertainment to the people thus , decreasing the need of community in their lives anymore . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , the young people are tired of all the bloodshed or trickery going on in the camouflage community which lead to communal riots or the biased decisions taken by the communities . <\s>
<s> Like , deciding a wealthy or influential person as a head of the community who does n't deserves it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition to this , the cut-throat competion prevailing in this era forces the young lot of the community to work more and more to achieve success and thus most of them end up with the shortage of time for their community and family . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , the corruption prevaling at different levels in the community is also reponsible for discouraging more energetic and tenacious young people to be a part of it . <\s>
<s> An individual always tend to consider his / her family interests over the interests of the community of which he/she is a part . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , now-a-days the rigor of their hectic lives and the above mentioned alternatives do n't let the youger generation realize the importance of camaraderie and commuinty . <\s>
<s> Certainly , herculian afforts are required to inspire the youger generation for involving in communal decisions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude in a nutshell , in present world young people are more focused in the happiness in their personnal lives rather than offering their sevices for the betterment of the community . <\s>
<s> Some people like to travel alone , while others want to go travel with a guide . <\s>
<s> Each has sevral pros and cons . <\s>
<s> However , I believe to enjoy traveling safe and effective , one should travel with a group of people led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> That ' because it is safer and a tour guide knows well about certain regions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , traveling with a companion is much safer . <\s>
<s> No one denies that there are bobberies or dangerous accidents in famous spots . <\s>
<s> If a person faces a problems when going travel alone , it is greatly hard to solve it . <\s>
<s> However , with a group of people with a guide , one is likely to overcome angerous situations , because a tour guide may be aware of some difficulties in the country . <\s>
<s> For example , I went to a Jeju island a yeas ago with my family . <\s>
<s> We had hard time to see a doctor because my sister got food poisoning . <\s>
<s> At that time we could cope with problems thanks to the guide 's aid . <\s>
<s> If it were not for her help , my sister would have sicked during whole vacation period . <\s>
<s> We never forget her kindness and after that we become to go trip with a guide whenever traveling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On top of that , we can travel as many places as long as we are not tired . <\s>
<s> Since tour guides are a professional of their region , they can recommand which places are good to see and which market sell product more cheap . <\s>
<s> These abilities help travelers to enjoy fully their vacation . <\s>
<s> To be specific , I went to East Europe with a group of people , and we could go where we had looked forward to visit . <\s>
<s> That 's because we notices this to a guide and guide made a perfect schedule . <\s>
<s> As a result , that travel is the best trip in my life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , one can make friends with the help of a tour guide . <\s>
<s> Most of tour guids are living where they are reponsibla to show and explain . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they know many people living there . <\s>
<s> We have chance to meet indigenous people with a guide , This gives great pleasure to foreigners . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , there are some negative aspects when traveling with a guide . <\s>
<s> However , positive effects are much more . <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I believe that traveling with a guide with a group of people is the best way to enjoy one 's vacation . <\s>
<s> If I have a chance to on a trip , I would go abroad with a group which is led by a tour guide . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Up to a certain point , I think academic education should be based much more on theory than on practice . <\s>
<s> There will be enough time to get acquainted to practice and more factual information later , especially during our professional life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This does not exclude inductive approach to concepts . <\s>
<s> Starting from factual observation can be a very good way to understand complex concepts , but the aim remains to give the students a knowledge of the theoretical tools , which must be the main objective since it is the most difficult . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is from such theoretical tools that a human being can develop his or her ability to go deeper into any specific subject . <\s>
<s> As part of a specific society , we all have a common historical and philosophical heritage which influences our way of thinking , sometimes without us even knowing it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To learn more about the concepts and ideas that others have brooded upon before us makes our judgment firmer . <\s>
<s> It is only once we have mastered an idea that we can really reject it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , practically speaking , it is much easier and faster to learn facts than to understand ideas . <\s>
<s> Thus it seems the perfect time for the student , while he is studying , to spend time on ideas rather than on facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The danger of course lies in losing connection with reality . <\s>
<s> But as soon as one goes a little deeper in the history of ideas , it becomes very difficult to be a genuine idealist . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , there is an advantage that could stem from the learning of facts - students could draw their own conclusions from those very facts , and be in a way more active than the students trying to understand concepts with the help of teachers or authors . <\s>
<s> But the thing is that this happens permanently and spontaneously in everyday life , whereas straining to understand a passage from Hegel would not spontaneously be a man 's activity . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Starting from the concepts create a virtuous circle between facts learning and concepts understanding since when a student really gets the core of a concept , he will naturally look for applications of it . <\s>
<s> In my view it is not true that young people do n't dedicate enough of their spare time to helping in their communities . <\s>
<s> In the contrary , I see a lot of young people supporting local projects to help the older , the poor or to help children to grow up und thrive in a more healthy and heartfelt environment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I experience that a lot of help is given through the local church organisations . <\s>
<s> They run a variety of projects - from helping kids to do their homework in the afternoons to supporting the poor by handing out daily portions of freshly cooked food . <\s>
<s> Most of the work done by the church organisations could not be achieved without the help of young people . <\s>
<s> Although the young nowadays seem to have so many different options to spend their spare time , if you take a closer look , it is not so different as it was in former times . <\s>
<s> Sports , friends and other cultural activities may consume now as they have always consumed a part of the spare time . <\s>
<s> But just as in former days some of the spare time is dedicated to help others in need . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am aware of the fact that not all the young people suppport their communities and that some projects may need more help from the youth . <\s>
<s> But overall one cannot say , the young do n't dedicate enough time to support worthy causes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The dedication of young people to community work may be less visible now then it was in former times . <\s>
<s> Mass media tend to overestimate other news . <\s>
<s> They usually do n't concentrate on the small differences the dedication to a church group , for example , makes . <\s>
<s> The help of the young may be largely unvisible to a larger community . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless it makes all the difference for the people that experience the help - just as it has always been . <\s>
<s> The population of the world is growing at a tremendous pace also the technology is growing . <\s>
<s> As the technology is growing it has become more attainable and affordable . '' <\s>
<s> In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> With the changing phase of mans life and emergence of improved standard of living I really believe there could be many more cars than there are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The population of world has been continuously increasing . <\s>
<s> And so the the number of people out to suceed in life and make a mark of themself are also considerably many . <\s>
<s> Every successful man would like to own a car someday . <\s>
<s> This is everyones dream . <\s>
<s> So the possibility of number of cars in the world could be multiplying at a very huge rate considering that many people realise their dream . <\s>
<s> As the population is growing the market for various commodities and necessities of man are also growing . <\s>
<s> In this process of expansion of the market the prices for variious commodities are coming down by a huge margin . <\s>
<s> So the cost of the commodities are also coming down because of increasiing market and competition . <\s>
<s> The market is flooded with goods and competition between the producers of these goods has also become high . <\s>
<s> More the competition , the producers tries to attract more customers . <\s>
<s> In order to attract the coustomers the only way being an affordable price of the goods in the market . <\s>
<s> In this way the prices of various goods have come down drastically . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now , considering the advent of technology and globalosation of many industries the income and standard of people has improved stupendously . <\s>
<s> There has been a considerable elevation in the standard of living and stature in the society . <\s>
<s> So the affordability pf people has also increased . <\s>
<s> So the demand for products that were once only reachable to a ceratin section of people has increased following the increase in the standard of living for many poeple . <\s>
<s> Car is one such commodity that was once a dream for many a poeple has now become possible to acheive and many people are dreaming about it . <\s>
<s> And the important thing is that many are realising their dream . <\s>
<s> So the number of poeple who can afford a car are increasing and so are the number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The number of cars in the next twenty years could be at sky high following the study of the market and increasing affordability of poeple . <\s>
<s> It is going to be revolutionary change of the world in next twenty years considering not just the cars but various other goods that would flood the market . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So there would be many more cars than those existing today in twenty years from now and there could be many more developing nations evolving and increased number of poeple who would enjoy life even more with all these changes . <\s>
<s> The process of learning changes through the education of everybody . <\s>
<s> At the beginning , at kindergarden , you just learn processes and how you can manage certain tasks , like cutting out or painting a nice , cute picture . <\s>
<s> Later in Pre-School and Junior-High you have to learn facts to get a basic knowledge in all parts , which are important in life and are of interest for your later developement . <\s>
<s> But the latest in High School , under ideal conditions , everybody should n't just learn facts and figures . <\s>
<s> Just stuying numbers and notes gives you the opportunity to have an answere ready to each question but that does n't mean you are able to explain what you have studied neither can you transfer your facts and figures to other interesting fields . <\s>
<s> I totally agree with the statement , that ideas and concepts are much more important . <\s>
<s> They make you able to generalize what you know and learn interdisciplinary . <\s>
<s> An example would be , if you know about the political system of Europe and can contrast it with other political systems and have really understood the concepts you can easyly judge the monedary politics of countries and why money and law can make a difference . <\s>
<s> This just by adding your knowledge of math and governmental studies with your knowledge of law . <\s>
<s> With just knowing facts about the political systems and not having understood the process , this combination and explaination would not be easy to make . <\s>
<s> Besides , by not just studying facts , you will be able to adapt what you know much more easier to fields and areas you have n't heard of . <\s>
<s> I think , especially in College , this is really important . <\s>
<s> It helps you connect everything you see and learn and gives you the abillity to take part in complex discussions . <\s>
<s> From my own experince , I know that this overall problem is disscussed controvercial . <\s>
<s> Although some people might think is makes more sense , having all the facts about a topic ready , I prefer being able to explain everything in my own words , because I have understood what I am talking about . <\s>
<s> This usually goes to show if somebody asks me to explain something he has n't understood . <\s>
<s> If I ca n't put it in my own words , me too , do n't really have a clue of what I have studied . <\s>
<s> Of course , it takes a lot more time and passion to read about a topic , but you can say you got the whole idea behind it and I strongly believe it 's worth it . <\s>
<s> By doing so , I also keept that knowledge for a much longer time than the knowledge I have from learning facts . <\s>
<s> This means that I usually ferget those after taking the test I have learned them for . <\s>
<s> Versus the understanding I have from figuring out a topic by trying to get the ideas and concepts behind it . <\s>
<s> This topic I usually keep for a long long time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , the decision to just learn facts or the whole concept has to be made by every individual because it is also a matter of learning habits . <\s>
<s> I have decided and a rather study ideas than facts . <\s>
<s> Travelling can serve many purposes , ranging from pleasure and academic to businesses . <\s>
<s> A guided tour is often part of the former example of travelling ; for one 's pleasure or academic purpose . <\s>
<s> The best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide , however ; if I had the choice , I would rather travel alone . <\s>
<s> This is because of freedom that solo travel provides : freedom of planning your own travel , and freedom of avoiding problems caused by other group members . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , a benifit of travelling alone is that it gives you the freedom to plan your own travel . <\s>
<s> Since you are the only one who ` singed up ' for the tour , you are free to decide on the places you want to go to , when to go there , and what to do when you get there . <\s>
<s> As an example , when I went to Hawaii last summer , I decided to go there on my own , rather than joining a group tour . <\s>
<s> Because of that , I was able to see what I wanted to see ; the beaches to surf , rather than going shopping malls , which the tour focused . <\s>
<s> Also , I was able to pick when I wanted to go , unlike the fixed dates indicated on those tours . <\s>
<s> By travelling alone , I was able to enjoy my stay in Hawaii based on the greater magnitude of freedom I had . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , travelling alone gives you an additional degree of freedom since you are free from problems caused by others ; the possible costs I may have to incur due to actions of others . <\s>
<s> Imagine a scenario where I decided to sign up for a group tour to Hawaii . <\s>
<s> The schedule of which plane to take and what time the bus would come and pick me up at Honolulu International has already been planned out . <\s>
<s> But it 's not just my schedule ; it 's the entire group 's schedule . <\s>
<s> Let 's say that several selfish people decided to show up late . <\s>
<s> The whole tour has to suffer from the possible consequences caused by those individuals ; perhaps skiiping an activity we wanted to do or even delaying the trip entirely . <\s>
<s> It would n't make sense if the tour had to give up going to the beach because some individual was taking too long deciding on whether she should get a pink or a white Coach bag . <\s>
<s> By traveling alone , I am able to avoid possible problems caused by irresponsible companions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the statement of `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , '' I disagree in respect to the lack of freedom I would get from travelling in a group . <\s>
<s> Travelling alone would allow you to plan your own trip , ( the freedom of choosing the activity and its day ) and avoid possible problems caused by accompanying tourists ( such as skipping or delaying an activity . ) <\s>
<s> Unless I am certain that the tour somewhat follows an agenda similar to that of mine , I would not consider traveling on a group tour led by a guide . <\s>
<s> Some people overestimate the importance of facts and not pay enough attention to ideas and concepts , while some others approach the issue from a reverse angle and not care about facts and focuse on ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> I do not share any of these marginal positions and think that a middle-way including all these factors in different variatons should be applied in eductaion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Focusing only on ideas and concepts is problematic for students . <\s>
<s> For instance , if a course on 20th century politics forces students to pay their attention only to the major political ideas and concepts in 20th century without presenting any historical development or fact about the era , it can not be fruitful . <\s>
<s> Moreover , it can confuse the students ' minds by leaving ideas and concepts in space . <\s>
<s> It can become a boring philosophical discussion in the eyes of students , which says nothing about the era 's actual political life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Overestimating the importance of learning facts in education process is similarly problematic for students . <\s>
<s> If that course mentioned in the previous paragraph gives only factual information and focuses only on concrete historical developments , it can easily fail explaining the political life of the era . <\s>
<s> Because the ideas and concepts that had major impacts on these concrete developments are inseperable parts of such a course . <\s>
<s> They have a vital role in explaining those events . <\s>
<s> Without them , the course may become simple story sessions in the students ' eyes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , combining these factors in education is usefull in education . <\s>
<s> If the professor of the course mentioned above pays balanced attandance on factual information , ideas and concepts , the course can become an efficient course that covers the topic in a comprehensive way . <\s>
<s> The students can be able to link all the information they obtain from the course and have a complete picture of the political scene of the era in their minds . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I believe that ideas , concepts and facts are inseperable parts of a whole . <\s>
<s> Any education method that omits any of these parts is very likely to fail . <\s>
<s> In other words , students need to understand all these factors in their education process regardless of the topic they learn . <\s>
<s> I emphatically disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Youth is a time of insecurities and uncertainity , of tremendous pressure to carve a name for oneself and succeed . <\s>
<s> One often hears about teenagers or young professionals taking their own life on account of fear of failure . <\s>
<s> Youngsters are often too full of angst to enjoy themselves . <\s>
<s> They have to face peer pressure which may detract them from pursuit of their own happiness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , older or maturer people are more sure of themselves and clearer about what they want in life . <\s>
<s> They are also aware about the limited time span that each of us have on this earth . <\s>
<s> They learn to enjoy each momemt to the fullest . <\s>
<s> With maturity people are better able to withstand peer pressure and make decisions based on what they want rather than on other people 's expectation of what they should be doing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Maturity also brings a sense of acceptance of what one is and what one is not ( in terms of capability ) . <\s>
<s> Acceptance of oneselves can be a truly liberating experience and opens doors towards pursuit of one 's calling or special aptitute . <\s>
<s> Age often brings financial security enabling one to explore one 's dreams , hobbies and hidden ambitions . <\s>
<s> The older people are also better networked socially and contributing members of their communities - this positively impacts their self esteem . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I met Anjali , a retired banker in my Italian Class . <\s>
<s> She was the most enthusiastic of all students and ended up topping the class . <\s>
<s> Post retirement she was fully exploring her love of languages and making full use of resources such as time and money available . <\s>
<s> She already knew German and was planning to study next level of Italian . <\s>
<s> When I met her after a year of passing out of Italian Livello I , she was already through with her Livello III and enrolled in a French class . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Her zest for life is truly infectious . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summation I would state that older people are much more capable of enjoyment and they often do enjoy their life more than youngsters do . <\s>
<s> Traveling in a group with a leading tour guide gives us much convenience . <\s>
<s> However , it also restricts our choices and freedom during the tour . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , we can customize our trip . <\s>
<s> Then , the trip might become harder , but it will be more impressive . <\s>
<s> There are three major goodness of a customized trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , we can schedule trip according to our need . <\s>
<s> Traveling with a tour guide makes us to see many things , but usually does not fulfill our need . <\s>
<s> However , the customized trip enables us to enjoy particular things enough that we want to and never restricts what we want to do . <\s>
<s> Moreover , we can reorganize the schedule every time we need , hence we can enjoy the trip more and more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , we can save money . <\s>
<s> Traveling with a guide is usually more expensive than without him and we even need additional money to pay the guide . <\s>
<s> Thus , we can save the money by planning our own plan and traveling without the guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , we can feel the real society of local . <\s>
<s> When we traveling in a group led by a tour guide , we usually move by bus and just see some important things and places , hence we are completely disconnected to the local society . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , we may not even say a word with a native . <\s>
<s> However , if we trip without a guide , we must contact with the local society to buy some essential and to ask for locations , and we can feel that we are really on a trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Traveling without a tour guide might not be an even road and you might starve , thirsty , and feel dangerous . <\s>
<s> However , once you do it , you will tend to travel independently again , and finally it will give more precious memories , responsibilities , and courage to you . <\s>
<s> There are several reasons why I agree with the proposed statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , because the ability to understand the esence of the information provided in school will give the student the possibility to apply that knowledge to as many situations as they have to face in the future . <\s>
<s> Meanwhile , knowing facts will just provide them a mountaion of rarely useful information . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact , the comprehension of the ideas and concepts should be teachers ' primary concern . <\s>
<s> Learning facts can be useful for life , but much greater is the importance of understanding of why those facts happened . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During the practice of my profession I can remember a large number of opportunities in which I took the examples and explanations given by university professors . <\s>
<s> Even when at the moment of learning the I did n't give them the importance that they deserved , eventually they turned out to be valuable asset for my career . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Probably , that is why some good advice will never be fogotten and will possibly be applied to many up coming experiences and situations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Personally , I find very difficult finding the esence of things . <\s>
<s> Mostly I chose the wrong way to solve problems of my life and profession . <\s>
<s> Actually , that can be the main reason why I have n't gotten to the top yet . <\s>
<s> Usually the most important leader are those that possess bright minds , so bright that they get to see things in a different way the normal people do . <\s>
<s> In other words , they are able to see the most important aspect of the issue they are facing , while the rest of the people just get to see matter that surrounds the most importan point . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that I will probably spend the rest of my days trying to understand the ideas and concepts with which I have to deal in both , my life and my career . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In short , I will always recommend young students to learn and understand the concepts and ideas they have to study , otherwise they will have just a great amount of useless information . <\s>
<s> It is a common notion that older people are in greater concern about their own health than younger people , talk about the `` good old times '' and often seem to be skeptical towards changes in lifestyle . <\s>
<s> However , this notion is only a matter of perspective and cannot be generalized that young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> In fact , enjoyment of life is such an individual concept that is impossible to compare the levels of enjoyment among different age groups . <\s>
<s> Who could give an general definition of `` enjoyment '' , let alone some way of measuring the level of it ? <\s>
<s> This , however , would be required before someone can state a different level of enjoying certain things . <\s>
<s> The answer whether there is a difference in the elvel of enjoying life between certain groups of people can only be a balanced one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The perceived difference in the level of enjoyment lies in the different ways that various people enjoy life . <\s>
<s> A close look at a typical family reunion , e.g. , Thanksgiving , where different age groups of one family get together , reveals that the difference in perceiving joy in life may very well be associated with the age of a certain person . <\s>
<s> While the grandparents may enjoy watching their grandchildren play , younger members of the family might need talking amongst themselves or some other activity to be able to enjoy their time . <\s>
<s> This , of course , cannot be generally said about all families , but certainly a similar case can be constructed from the social network of almost every individual . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Least to say , if young people enjoyed life more than older people , should n't there be some statistical evidence from the social sciences to support that claim ? <\s>
<s> Such a fact would certainly show in many observations , such as happiness surveys , comparisons of the quality of living across regions , or possibly suicide rates . <\s>
<s> Yet there is no numerical evidence to support that assertion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , while someone might perceive a difference that another person does n't enjoy life as much as the observer does , the only difference lies in the way the enjoyment is felt . <\s>
<s> When traveling , people always try to plan everything they can . <\s>
<s> They look for the best city to visit , the perfect hotel , the cheapest plane tarif , and the greatest activities to do while being there ; but sometimes planning all this by your own can be a little bit difficult . <\s>
<s> That is why , I will recomend to all the travelers looking for an adventure , to try a new experience , by letting a tour guide show you and another bunch of people all the things a new city could offer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When a person is in charge of guiding you through a city you are not familiar with , you can be sure , that guide will show you the most interesting places , will take you to the important museums , will point all the monuments , and in the mean time will explain to you everything there is tho know about the city and its history . <\s>
<s> It is a great opportunity for a person that actually knows the place to show you arround . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this kind of travel , you will have to adjust to a strict schedule , where you will even have an specific time for breakfast . <\s>
<s> You have to take into account that having a schedule is not always a bad thing , as it will enable you to use all the time you have wisely . <\s>
<s> If you are one of those who can wake up at 7AM , have a day full of activities , go to bed at 11PM , and be ready the next day to start all over again , this kind of adventure is for you . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you are traveling with your family , there is always a time during the trip you want to get rid of one or two members of the family . <\s>
<s> That is why if you travel in a group , you will have the opportunity to interact with people from different places , different cultures , and the most important , from different families . <\s>
<s> You can have a trip two weeks long , without getting bored , as there will be always someone new to talk to . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A lot of parents when taking their family to vacations , have the worry that something may go wrong , or that someone may not like what they have planned . <\s>
<s> When going with a tour guide , you have someone you can rely on , someone that has to solve any problem it may occur ; and if anyone does not like what was planned , you can always blame the tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having a tour guide can be an excellent choice , if you choose an excellent tour guide . <\s>
<s> Be aware that there are millions of options in every country you may want to visit , so be sure to evaluate all the alternatives , and to choose the one that best suits you . <\s>
<s> I strongly believe that it is crutial for students to learn and undertsand ideas and concepts than to blindly learn facts . <\s>
<s> It is important to do so as it is neccessary for a person to undertsand information before applying it . <\s>
<s> Many a time we will encounter situations in our lives where we may need to apply concepts or facts that we know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Information that cannot be applied when needed is completely useless to us . <\s>
<s> It is very easy for people to learn and memorize facts , but if they do not understand what they memorized , information that they just absorbed will prove to be completely useless to them . <\s>
<s> For example , if a student learns a basic concept required to apply in a simple problem of mathematics , he or she cannot use the information they learned in order to solve a more complex problem of the same kind since they never were able to understand the main concept behind it . <\s>
<s> If a person just learns facts , he or she is not excercising their ability to question . <\s>
<s> Questioning is a very important aspect in learning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If people do not question , it is very difficult for them to develop intellectually . <\s>
<s> As questioning leads to reasoning and without reasoning one can not understand facts . <\s>
<s> If we learn facts blindly , we are not applying the potential within is . <\s>
<s> This may cripple our ability to advance . <\s>
<s> There will not be any difference among humans and computers , except that we perform human functions such as breathing and eating and they do not . <\s>
<s> After all , computers were created to learn , not think . <\s>
<s> Facts are inputed in them , they do not have the ability to understand concepts . <\s>
<s> We created computers because we understood concepts and idea , we can not advance if we stop taking advantage of our abilty to understand and reason . <\s>
<s> Why only few individuals in the society are successful ? <\s>
<s> Why not everyone succed in their career ? <\s>
<s> A perfect answer to this question is that not everyone try new things and take risk in their life . <\s>
<s> People commonly opt for safe and secured paths of life . <\s>
<s> Usually , people follow the most commonly used path and never try to explore new ways and means to get to their destination . <\s>
<s> Very few make use of their novel ideas to acheive respective goals . <\s>
<s> This emphasises the significance of following creative trends and taking up risky challenges to end in success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Scientists are the living proof for stating that ` Success results from exploration and risk taking '' . <\s>
<s> Very few turn into scientists because of their innovations and research where in they try to find out new procedures by experimenting in a different fashion other than common people who do it in an already known way . <\s>
<s> Best example i can ever quote is about a professor in our medical school who tried to cure cancers in a different form of therapy called Brachy therapy rather than the reguraly followed modes of treatment like Chemotherapy or Surgey . <\s>
<s> My professor experimented with the new technique built up by his ownknowledge and experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Students who take unrelated courses rather than regular ones may land in success soon . <\s>
<s> In addition , they have proved that nothing is impossible if you try hard to acheive a goal . <\s>
<s> For instance , one of my best friends registered in the courses likeTheatre recording and Video taping as soon as he finished his under graduation which is nothing but taking a risk as he is not sure of his success with his creative idea of taking a different course in his graduate studies . <\s>
<s> However , all our classmates found his act to be surprising and concluded that he is going to end up in defeat and can never succed in his career as he opted for an irrelevant course from his undergraduate studies . <\s>
<s> To everyones surprise , today my fried is one of the highest earners of the year by working in the Theatre recordings and Videa taping centres . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , i personally believe that success is never sought with out exploring novel ideas and involvement of risk . <\s>
<s> Infact , i have learnt from my personal experiences of life regarding my professor and my close friend that one has to take risk and try something new rather than following everyone in the society . <\s>
<s> People who tries new things and takes risks are more successful than the other one because creativity , chance and work are the recipe to get success . <\s>
<s> People creative have most of the time ideas more interesting and new than the other . <\s>
<s> To success in a domain you need to the first one or to be the better . <\s>
<s> For instance , when you open a shop you need to have a new concept to be the first one . <\s>
<s> In this case you create a new market . <\s>
<s> It 's harder for an artist the paintings or readings must be totally new to be loved . <\s>
<s> Who wants to buy a product of all the day or sees a paintings already made ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But creativity is not enough to success . <\s>
<s> One important ingredient is taking risks . <\s>
<s> Taking a risk means go through the barrier imposed by yourself or by the society . <\s>
<s> The risk could be in anyone aspect of the life on different domain . <\s>
<s> For example , creating a new painting is be exposed to the judgement of people . <\s>
<s> Opening a shop caused a financial risk for you and could imply your family . <\s>
<s> So the risk is enhanced when you have a family . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But even if creativity and risk are linked one of the most important ingredient of this successful recipe is the work . <\s>
<s> Without working the success is not guaranted even if you take risks or if you try new things . <\s>
<s> Of course you can succeed one times but we can measure the success only on period of time like the length of the life . <\s>
<s> You can have one mater-piece but it 's not really a success if you do n't have more than one . <\s>
<s> For a shop it 's the same . <\s>
<s> The first year could be really good but it 's not enough to judge of your success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The success of course needs creativity and chance but it needs beyond all of work . <\s>
<s> We can finally judge the success not only an action but more then on a life . <\s>
<s> WHEN YOU TRAVEL IN A GROUP LED BY A TOUR GUIDE YOU WILL KNOW THE MOST COMMON PLACES THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND FAMILIAR FOR MOST OF PEOPLE . <\s>
<s> THIS WAY OF TRAVELING HAS MANY ADVANTAGES BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL THINGS PLANNED AND YOU DONT HAVE TO THINK ON SOLVING CERTAIN PROBLEMS THAT YOU COULD HAVE WHEN TRAVELING , LIKE FOOD , HOTEL AND TRANSPORTATION TO ALL PLACES YOU WANT TO SEE . <\s>
<s> IF YOU HAVE TO GET TICKETS FOR AN IMPORTANT EVENT OR SHOW YOU WIILL NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS TO GET THEM . <\s>
<s> BESIDES , YOU ARE SPENDING YOU TIME WITH OTHERS AND YOU WILL BE SAFE IN CASE OF VISITING A DANGEROUS COUNTRY . <\s>
<s> IN ADDITION , YOU WILL HAVE SPECIFIC TIMES FOR EVERY ACTIVITY YOU DECIDE TO TAKE AND THE WARRANTY THAT YOU HAVE A SAFE SPACE IN EVERY TRANSPORT YOU NEED TO TAKE . <\s>
<s> THOSE ARE THE GOOD REASONS YOU HAVE FOR TRAVELING IN A TOUR GUIDE . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> IN MY CASE I CONSIDER THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL IS WHEN YOU DO IT BY YOURSELF AND YOU PLAN ALL PLACES YOU WANT TO VISIT AND THE TIMES YOU LIKE TO SPEND ON EVERY ONE . <\s>
<s> I DO NOT LIKE TO BE TIED TO OTHERS LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE AT SPECIFIC TIME AT A CERTAIN PLACE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS BETTER WHEN YOU ARE SPONTANEOUS AND YOU ACT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES . <\s>
<s> FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GOT A PLACE THAT YOU REALLY LIKED IF YOU WERE IN A GROUP YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT MOST OF THE GROUP WANT AND YOU ARE NOT FREE TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO . <\s>
<s> WHEN VISITING A DIFFERENT COUNTRY THE BEST WAY OF KNOWING IT IS BY GOING TO MANY PLACES AND NOT ONLY TO VISIT THE MOST POPULAR ONES . <\s>
<s> IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REAL FOOD , THE ACTUAL ECONOMICAL SITUATION AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART , THE PEOPLE , YOU SHOULD GO TO COMMON PLACES NOT FOR THE TOURISTS BUT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE COUNTRY . <\s>
<s> IF YOU WANT TO LEARN OR PRACTICE THE LANGUAGE YOU SHOULD GO TO PLACES WHERE THERE IS NO HELPING PEOPLE TO DO THE THINGS AND SPEAK FOR YOU IN CASE OF NEEDING IT . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> IN A WORD , I AGREE THE BEST WAY OF TRAVELING IS WHEN YOU DO IT BY YOURSELF AND DO THE THINGS YOU WANT TO WITHOUT CONSIDERING ASKING OTHER PEOPLE AND VISITING ONLY THE POPULAR PLACES THAT YOU WILL NOT KNOW VERY WELL BECAUSE OF TIME AND PEOPLE YOU ARE TRAVELING WITH . <\s>
<s> I DO NOT LIKE TOUR GUIDES . <\s>
<s> Some students put a higher value in understanding the ideas and their concepts , rather than understanding the facts . <\s>
<s> The fact that I graduated with a major in International Business , has exposed me to different elements , all taken in account when questioning myself , which of the both statements I agree with . <\s>
<s> However , both can have equal advantages that are quite different in many aspects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , understanding a subject 's ideas and concepts is more critical than studying the facts . <\s>
<s> For instance , the overall idea will stay in a student 's mind for a much longer period , sometimes even for ever . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , these ideas and concepts can be re-used in the future in various situations . <\s>
<s> For instance , those I had learned in my Business class helped me to open my own company a few years later . <\s>
<s> However , putting higher importance in studying the subject 's ideas and concepts only , can have equal disadvantageous elements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Understanding the facts can be dramatically important , depending on the chosen subject and career field especially . <\s>
<s> For instance , a history student is likely to study the facts and dates of a historical event because its required . <\s>
<s> If the facts are used on a regular basis , the student might be able to remember some of them for an eternal period of time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , learning about a theme 's ideas and concepts was very beneficial for me with regards to my major . <\s>
<s> However , each student should be able to make an own decision , when questioning himself what is more essential for his studies . <\s>
<s> Furthermore the student 's chosen career plays an important role , when answering this question . <\s>
<s> YES i agree that young people do not get time helping their communities . <\s>
<s> the reason for this i think is the increasing of the fast and busy life and also because of more and more increasing compettition . <\s>
<s> this leads to the pressure on the young people and require to struggle as much as they can to lead a succesful life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> earlier the fight for the facilities , employment , leisures of life were not so difficult to achieve . <\s>
<s> this may be because the earlier life was more simple . <\s>
<s> but as there is a boom of technologies and introduction to new fields , the young people require much harder effort and persisstance to get through the comming challenges . <\s>
<s> earlier the structure of the societies was also different than it is today . <\s>
<s> their was much more interaction between people and the young ones and the adults would participate together . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason of the availability of less time for the young people can be because of the introductions to more and new means of entertainment , interaction etc.entertainment like television etc. and interaction facilities such as internet chats or mobile services etc.therefore the young people spend most of the time in either struggling for their better lives or spending time with new means and sources for leisure whenever they get free time . <\s>
<s> for example a person with the same 24 hours if given a choice would do more productive work which would be beneficial for him in future than spending time to interact with people . <\s>
<s> the phrase ' survival of the fittest ' is now best suitable for the developing societies and young people wants to cope up with the speed to find their way for their easy survival . <\s>
<s> even in case of small children , the increase in the difficulty of their subjects and the increasing load has restricted them to spend more time in playing with their friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> i would say that the young one are not to be blamed of the current senario because the situation has created a need for them to behave in a more introvert rather than more extrovert manner . <\s>
<s> the young people , s behaviour is changing due to change in the structuring of the overall society . <\s>
<s> the society is forcing the young ones to fight more for their future than living the present and spending time to socialise and time witheir communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The above reasons i think justifies that why young people do not give enough time to help their communities . <\s>
<s> As an engineering student I do think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts . <\s>
<s> Eventhough sometimes there are facts you must learn in order to understand concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One cannnot build a boat float if one does not know why it floats and therefore how much it can carries before it sinks . <\s>
<s> The concepts of physics need to be understood in order to adapt to every case and make the best choice in materials , shape etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A historian cannot explain a revolution only by facts . <\s>
<s> The understanding of the ideas shared by the different layers of the society is necessary and a simple description of events cannot replace the analysis of the historical situation which is at stake . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , in order to understand subjects like biology or chemistry you need to learn a certain amount of facts . <\s>
<s> Which element is to react with an other one , how the fast and how strong the reaction is . <\s>
<s> A doctor must learn where are all the bones and the muscles in our body before he can even learn how to make a diagnosis . <\s>
<s> He has to learn which drug can cure each illness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The learning process is not just about facts or ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> To understand a concept , a fact can be helpful because our brain can associate an image to the concept . <\s>
<s> And the other way is also true , learning the ideas of romanticism without reading examples and facts is not worthy . <\s>
<s> Global comprehension of a subject can only be reached once both ideas and facts are learned . <\s>
<s> To introduce a concept , it is a common easy way to start with a fact , something that can be observed , before the ides behind can be explained . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is the `` knowledge one would be interested in acquiring '' . <\s>
<s> It is rather difficult to state a single opinion because most of the work conducted in several sections of our lives are based on a particular topic at depth using other topics . <\s>
<s> But , I think knowledge about a particular topic to depth will certainly be better . <\s>
<s> There are several reasons for stating this opinion . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the more the knowledge you have , the better you understand it . <\s>
<s> Therefore , knowing more information about the topic helps you to understand it more accurately . <\s>
<s> For example , as the information explored from the universe is increasing , we are having better idea of it . <\s>
<s> So , i think knowing a particular subject to depth would help a lot in improving our ability in the subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , we are in a world where the inventions and discoveries have led to many revolutions . <\s>
<s> So , the information about a particular topic is so abundant that specialising in more than one subject is really difficult . <\s>
<s> For example , the information about our body is so huge that no one can know it to the brink . <\s>
<s> So , there has been specializations in the medicinal field . <\s>
<s> It is better to know a specific subject confidently rather than knowing more without accuracy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It will be a honour for anyone if your name is stated when the topic is named . <\s>
<s> Because , you know everything or to the maximum about it . <\s>
<s> For example , some of the professors in the colleges are famous for the subject they teach only because they are excellent at it . <\s>
<s> This definitely encourages to know more about that specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreoften , scientists are famous for their inventions and innovations because they make the world quite comfortable . <\s>
<s> All these scientists mostly concentrate on a particular topic . <\s>
<s> They do researches in a specific topic to demonstrate various experiments . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I believe that specialization in one topic would be a better option rather than broad understanding of many topics . <\s>
<s> It can be seen from the reasons stated that better knowledge does enhances the life of the individual and also the society he/she lives in . <\s>
<s> Event though it is really important to understand ideas and concepts because they represent the basis of knowledge , I disagree with the statement because I think that learning the facts is as much important , as well . <\s>
<s> I have several reasons for my statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , I think that the facts enables students to understand a concept , because it is more concrete , it is a kind of illustration in a lesson . <\s>
<s> For instance for concepts in science , such as chemistry , it is not possible to understand a concept without experimenting a fact that illustrates the concept . <\s>
<s> The concept of status modification for solids , liquids or gaz can only be assimilated when we have learnt that water evaporates at 100 degrees and is frozen at 0 degree . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , students remember easier the facts than the concepts , because it is more interesting and less academic for him . <\s>
<s> For example , during field trips , students have good memories of their trip because they considered it as an entertainment even if the purpose of the trip was to teach an academic lesson . <\s>
<s> Afterwards , students would remain the concepts because they would remain the trip and what they have seen during it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , it is more practical and efficient to learn facts than learn ideas . <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts are abstract notions that are difficult to learn and to represent in the mind . <\s>
<s> Because they are very exhaustive in books , it is difficult to learn and to understand it without facts . <\s>
<s> If we take the example of children that learn ideas and concepts all the time at school , we notice that they know their lesson appropriately but finally they do not really understand what they have been learnt in class . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So in my opinion , the best way to study is to learn facts as much as understand the ideas because they depend on each other . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take new risks .. '' <\s>
<s> . <\s>
<s> I firmly believe that ` success is a journey , not a destination ' . <\s>
<s> If one spends his entire life doing what he already know show to do well , he is not exploring new avenues and hence , will never know what life has to offer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A few examples to support my view are as follows . <\s>
<s> The first one is a story of a little boy who , out of curiosity and vision turned around his life . <\s>
<s> Once , dejected and depressed about things not working with his computer , he put thought into why that might be and tried out a ` new way ' to make things work . <\s>
<s> Today , the world knows the man by Bill Gates , one of the richest people and creator of Microsoft . <\s>
<s> A lot of great inventions come by accident and one needs to open one 's mind to trying new things in order to run into accidents . <\s>
<s> Another example is the popular 3M company which manufactures Post-it . <\s>
<s> While trying a `` new way '' to make a glue that sticks so well that it never comes off , a failure to do so , led to the invention of Post it notes which are popularly used world-wide today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Taking risks exposes a person to failures and makes him a stronger individual , a trait that ironically is the essence of success . <\s>
<s> I conclude with a few lines from the famous poem IF written by Rudyard Kipling - `` If you can make a heap of all your winnings , And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss , And lose , and start at the beginning , And never breathe a word about your loss '' ... <\s>
<s> then `` yours is the world and everything that 's in it , And which is more , you will be a man , my son '' . <\s>
<s> I can not take a clear position on the fact that young people enjoy life more than odler people . <\s>
<s> I think that they enjoy life in a different way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people just experience all the things they want to . <\s>
<s> They are not always conscient of what they are really doing and what could be the consequences of their acts . <\s>
<s> Often , they do not have any past experiences they can related to in order to judge if they should do it or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that in a way young people enjoy life more than older people because they are not as stressed . <\s>
<s> As a young woman , I can say that I do not considere the future as much as my parents do and in some ways it allows me to experience some situations that I would not if I was older . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I also have a very different perception of money . <\s>
<s> For me and most of young people , money is a substantial thing . <\s>
<s> It is very easy to have access to it and we are not affraid of credit , which is a big difference with older people . <\s>
<s> Not having money does not stop us to try things we want to . <\s>
<s> For example , many of us will just consent to take a loan to travel instead of waiting to have enough money as our parents would do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other way , I think older people enjoy life as much as us . <\s>
<s> With time , they readjust they expectations and their definition of what happiness is and appreciate more the little things that make your day to day life better . <\s>
<s> They do not dream of wide spaces anymore , or at least not as much as when they were younger . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think older people are happier to look at what they did during their life than what they are planning to do . <\s>
<s> For instance , my grandmother was not able to walk anymore so it stopped her to do many things she used to but this did not stop her to be happy . <\s>
<s> Her happyness and her description of what life was was to see her children and her grand children evoluate and experience things she already did . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As I said earlier , I think both young and old people enjoy life but in a very different way . <\s>
<s> I think that maybe older people are able to enjoy more their experiences due to the fact they have seen other things before and have been through more difficulties . <\s>
<s> I think older people can understand how youngers enjoy life , have been young already and have had the same feelings as them . <\s>
<s> But in another way , younger people can hardly imagine that older people enjoy life because they are not there yet in their development . <\s>
<s> The definition of an accomplished life changes during your life and that is why both young and old people enjoy life . <\s>
<s> From the beginning of industrial revolution , producers always wanted to sell their products more and as the time passed they saw that one of the best way of doing this is advertising their products . <\s>
<s> Although , the goal of advertising should be demostrating the features a particular product , sellers use advertisements to increase their sales by exaggerating it and make people want that particular product . <\s>
<s> Therefore , I strongly believe that advertisements make products or services seem better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Making people desire a product is a complicated issue but what advertisers realised about this is that the customer do not have to know what the product exactly is . <\s>
<s> Many people may be wrong about what they are buying because of advertisements or they may have a very little idea about what they liked to buy because of advertisements . <\s>
<s> As an example of this , the advertisements of big companies can be given . <\s>
<s> In that type of advertisements , vey little information about the product is given whereas , the focus of the advertisement is mainly the trademark itself . <\s>
<s> Although , people do not understand anything about what the product is or for what purposes they can use it , because of the effectiveness of the advertisement , the customers may chose to buy the product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another point to note is that the advertisements of certain products such as tobacco , alcohol or , say , fast food make these products seem not only a little better than what they really are . <\s>
<s> It is a well-known and proved fact that all these products may be tremendeausly harmful for humans ( in excessive use ) in long terms however by the help of advertisements , these products succeed to seem well to customers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The use of famous characters in advertisements is also another way of producers to make their products seem well to the customers . <\s>
<s> This way is also a short-cut for producers because it helps them to convience people about the goodness of their products . <\s>
<s> As to prove my idea , consider the advertisements in which the characters are well remembered and the message is forgotten . <\s>
<s> This is only a small trick that advertisers use to persuade people about a non-existing state-of-the-art product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , I am a strong fan of supervision on advertisements . <\s>
<s> This should not be understood as sensorship on free speech but the advertisements should be prepared in a way that people are not misleaded about the goodness of the product . <\s>
<s> By this supervision , I will be able to change my idea about advertisements because right know I believe that advertisements channel people toward products in unfair ways . <\s>
<s> While some people may think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , I think specializing in one specific subject is better , because when you specialize in one specific subject , you could have more opportunities to be a real expert on that subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , i 'm one of the believers of the famous quote : `` Time is money . '' <\s>
<s> It could be advisable to use time efficiently during our life because time is valuable . <\s>
<s> As far as i 'm concerned , we should use time specializing in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> In that way , we can have great knowledge about that subject , and that means we could have the chance to be an expert about that subject . <\s>
<s> I do n't blame the people who has many variable interests , but it is important to see the differences between having many interests and specializing in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> For example , one of my friends has a great interest in music and i see him every year trying to learn how to play a different instrument . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , it is clear that there is a bare chance for him to become a good , professional musician . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects keeps me away from the feeling of satisfaction . <\s>
<s> In other words , this kind of knowledge is not substantial for me . <\s>
<s> When we consider successful people in the world , we can obviously see that a big percentage of them chose the way to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> As a result , they become people who they are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , taking all the factors into consideration , we may safely reach the conclusion that the advantages of specializing in one specific subject outweigh those of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because when we specialize in one specific subject , we have the opportunity to be an expert on that subject and we can be satisfied and successful . <\s>
<s> Most of the time , youth is remembered as days of happiness and good memories . <\s>
<s> On the contrary , and especially in our times , becoming old is often seen as horrible and everybody tries to stay young with creams and other chemical products . <\s>
<s> But do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? <\s>
<s> I think they do , because only a few people make the right choice when they are young and because we have an illusory vision of youth . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First and foremost , young people have a lot of free time , they are having no reponsabilities . <\s>
<s> They are totally free to do what they want , or that what is widely believed . <\s>
<s> In fact the large majority of young people is to attend school , obey to their parents and deal with the problem of finding their place in this world . <\s>
<s> The difference with older people lies in the fact that they are asked to do almost everything they do as older people choose a job , a wife , a place to live and all the others things . <\s>
<s> The time that is still left , once what is demamded is done , is really free : this time is given generously to young people and is precious to older people . <\s>
<s> This is when they live like they want , and often so as to be the contrary their parents wanted them to be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Once people get a job , a wife , an husband , a situation , they forget that they are free , that they can live like they want even if it is not easy . <\s>
<s> Actually , freedom is much more dangerous for grown-up than for teenagers : parents are there to help and to rescue in case of emergency and there is little time when the dangers of freedom can be experienced . <\s>
<s> The experience of freedom during the youth is faked because the inner feeling of freedom is not balanced by a great dangers . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , older people see much more risks in freedom . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People do not learn fro their youth . <\s>
<s> In our modern society cars are used a lot and most of the people ca n't manage to live without them . <\s>
<s> I , however , agree with the statement and believe that cars will be less used in twenty years than they are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On one hand it could be inferred that the number of cars will increase , because we have a very big car market nowadays . <\s>
<s> More beautiful and technological cars are offered every day and the people are drawn to buy them . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , also young people are encouraged to buy them because this way they can feel independent and free . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , however , cars are beeing replaced more and more often by other means of transportation such as bycicles and motobycicles . <\s>
<s> In my native country , Italy , cities are becoming very crowded and it is inconvinient to use a car , because of the traffic and the difficulty of finding a parking place . <\s>
<s> Therefore people try to avoid picking up the car in the morning and prefer to use other means . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of transport services offered for people nowadays , even for those who live or work far away . <\s>
<s> Metros , busus and trains are often used also because it costs less than buying a car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even though , the market tempts us to buy cars advertising and promoting them in the most various ways , I believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than nowadays . <\s>
<s> In fact , I noticed that the means of transportation and communication are getting better day by day , encouraging people not to use the car . <\s>
<s> It would be only a waste of time and money . <\s>
<s> Additionally , people are becoming more sensitive in what concerns our environment : driving a car pollutes the air and ruins the place we are living in . <\s>
<s> Yes , i do agree with the statement of successful people tring new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> Now let us first know who are these so called successful people . <\s>
<s> They are people who are a kind of have expertised and very much on top of what ever work they do or what ever field they are in . <\s>
<s> Lets take some examples of Micheal Jackson from the field of music or Rahul Dravid from the field of sports who are undoubtedly some of the most successful people around us . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now , since successful people have gained so much control , popularity and the kind of achievment they wanted , so there remains very little to prove themselves as they have already proved themselves . <\s>
<s> So there is no point in confining them to only the things they have been doing which they already know how to do very well . <\s>
<s> infact you can put in this way that they have the great opportunity to do something new by taking a few risks . <\s>
<s> The work of trying something new by the successful people becomes much more easier because of the popularity and the fame they achieved when being successful in their previous profession or job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can make the above concept much clearer by taking the example of Sachin Tendulkar who being a great cricketer for india , he also started a restaurant named TENDULKAR 'S in Mumbai . <\s>
<s> So from this we get to know that though he is not a professional hotelier , he tried his hand at this new job by taking a few risks , since he is a successful person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> so , before i end my essay i would like to conclude stating that successful people do try new things rather then only doing what they know how to do well , mainly by using their popularity in the previously done work and also may be to get a kind a fresh breath of air into their monotenous and boring previous work though they might be successful in that particular profession . <\s>
<s> The issue at hand is that whether knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialization in any one particular subject . <\s>
<s> I believe that specialization in a particular subject is a better than having knowledge about many subjects . <\s>
<s> I believe so because specialized form of knowledge leads to complete knowledge about the subject at hand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , I beleive that specialization in a particular subject is a better option because it involves greater in depth analysis of various details and its influence on other things as well . <\s>
<s> For example , consider a Heart Specialist Doctor who has specialization in heart surgery . <\s>
<s> Such a doctor is better than other general physicians when it comes to heart related ailments . <\s>
<s> Such a specialist is in a better state to advise things related to heart problems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additionally , specialization in a subject is better because a specialist can do the research work related to a particular specialized field more effectively and efficiently . <\s>
<s> A research done by a specialist is more credible than a research done by a non-specialist . <\s>
<s> For example , Newton was a specialist in his field , so his research and discoveries are still considered great works in his fields . <\s>
<s> Any one cannot do such a research and lead to great discoveries , but only a specialist like Newton can . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , in my views , a person with specialized knowledge about a particular subject is better able to communicate things and impart knowledge to others . <\s>
<s> To bolster this , consider the point that all our professors and lecturers in our schools and colleges are specialists in their fields . <\s>
<s> A Physics professor will be able to teach physics more effectively than any a science teacher who has superficial knowledge about that subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , by stating all these points I conclude that specialized form of subject knowledge is better than superficial knowledge about many different academic subjects . <\s>
<s> A specialist is the only person whose has great in depth knowledge about the subject at hand . <\s>
<s> According to the statement , that it is better for students to understand what they learn , namely the concepts and the ideas , rather than learning facts by heart , is convincing to me . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In general it is more effective to a student to learn ideas and concepts , as they will last longer in their memory . <\s>
<s> I can emphasize this by my own experience , as it s very difficult to memorize facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Learning dates for instance for a History course does not help a lot in understanding why historical events happened or what effects they could have on our contemporary time . <\s>
<s> Facts also does not help the students in the future , when they leave the university . <\s>
<s> When entering the job world , it is much more helpful for a student to know the basic concepts and ideas , which he or she can apply in his or her job . <\s>
<s> Taking the example of the History course again , it would be more logic , if the student learn the main differences between the epoches or the essential research methods , which historians need to accurately do their work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The studies should provide a framework , within the students can work by their own . <\s>
<s> Some lecturers would argue that it is nevertheless important to know some facts . <\s>
<s> I agree with that , but learning facts should not be the main part of the class work . <\s>
<s> There should be rather more interchanging action in the class , so that maybe old concepts will be discussed critically and new ideas can develop . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Understanding the ideas and concepts provides the student with the ability to use them and work independently . <\s>
<s> This should be the prior aim of every university , namely to educate the student to an independent thinker . <\s>
<s> A cheetah can run 170 miles/h when its young and slows down when gets older and would rather chase already dieing pray or not even bother for it if he can get his hand on a weaker predator . <\s>
<s> As far as this saying goes it is appropriate to state that young people can tend to enjoy a lot more then older people . <\s>
<s> life is becoming fast everyday and grows faster by the hour and the faster it gets the more people tend to release out their stress and thus end up enjoying the moments rather then wondering what will happen if they do bad at their job and they turn worse in an interview or even fail at an exam they have preparing for months . <\s>
<s> By the time it all happens and everything tends to come through we all realise OH ! <\s>
<s> my god ! <\s>
<s> i wasted so much time planning tommorow and look i have become old and useless . <\s>
<s> why not leave everything aside and live today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As the genration has passed peoples thinking has evolved with more night clubs opening and parties held through out the year the new generation has learned to live through the stress rather then live with it . <\s>
<s> people who are old and who have not evolved with the times tend to stay in their own little space and move out a little and talk about old times that they had. , missing on the fact the time is now and else is long gone . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> MY friend has a grand father whom i respect very much , but then he still lives in the old times and telling us what happened centuries ago and that we should discuss matters that we have no knowledge of what so ever . <\s>
<s> while on the other hand if their is an occasion all the benevolent people get together to party while everybody tells us to study . <\s>
<s> Its not that we do n't study , we do it when its needed and no compromise with the enjoyments that we have now cuz this will all become a memory in course of time so live it through all , while we all can . <\s>

<s> Eat the cake before the friends get home or there will be none left to taste and you will know that was probably the best cake ever made . <\s>

<s> TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY <\s>
<s> LIVE IT ALL ............. <\s>
<s> It is true that the question whether young people give enough time to helping their communities has always been of great interest . <\s>
<s> Although many people argue that community involvement is not sufficient , especially within the younger generation , I personally believe that there is much more activity than many people know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all it has to be taken into account that many young people , after finishing high school , spend a couple of month or even a year working for the community . <\s>
<s> Indeed , no matter whether it is military or social service , this time is sacrified for their country or for projects abroad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , unlike many people believe , statistics proove that community involvement has even increased during the last years . <\s>
<s> For instance , already during high school many pupils spend their free time within clubs or associations . <\s>
<s> These activities might be related to sports , within a religious community or even related to political work . <\s>
<s> But the growing engagement of young people is especially obvious on colleges . <\s>
<s> Indeed , all universities have different kinds of student associations and they are likely to have also one where students deal with social projects . <\s>
<s> These may include fundraising for a third world country , helping children with their homework or organizing events for elder people . <\s>
<s> There is a large variety of what students do , but they all proove a high committment for other people an the community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But there is also another reason , that clearly indicates the growing importance of engagement which is not directly related to the acedemic or professional career . <\s>
<s> Since a couple of years , it can be noticed , that companies are looking for people to hire who have a proven track record of social engagement . <\s>
<s> Indeed , social skills are getting more and more important , and young people are also aware of this . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they try to proove their community involvement and thus improve their career opportunities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , given the examples described above , there can be no doubt about a significant involvement of young people helping their communities . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , there is still potential for more and people in general should always try to spend some time in helping others . <\s>
<s> Some students think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts . <\s>
<s> I belong to this category of student because ideas and concepts are more general and easier to understand . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason why I think it 's more important to understand ideas and concepts is the variety of situation I can apply the same concepts . <\s>
<s> Sometimes , during their studies , people learn of lot of different ideas from their many courses . <\s>
<s> At the begining , students might think that all the concepts they learn are only related to the classe they are taking . <\s>
<s> However , students may be surprised that a specific topic can also be apply to other disciplines . <\s>
<s> For instance , when I went to the University , I enrolled in a seminar of ethical issues regarding medical interventions . <\s>
<s> At first , I was n't very interested learning this subject just because my major was in business . <\s>
<s> However , the week after the seminar , a dramatic event happend . <\s>
<s> In fact , my father lost his job without logical reason and after 25 years in the same company . <\s>
<s> At this point , I changed my mind and I saw that ethic can also be apply in business management because obviously the company in which my father worked had no ethic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts because it 's easier . <\s>
<s> When people learn facts , it could be very hard to understand the main idea or the conclusion of an event . <\s>
<s> Indeed , facts often involve different points of view and conclusion might differ from a person to another . <\s>
<s> Unlike fact , ideas and concept are the most of the time very clear . <\s>
<s> For example , if a student in an economic class learn the concept of supply and demand , it must be very clear because everybody agree with this concept . <\s>
<s> However , the fact that the price of tomatoes has increased after a twister because all plantations were destoyed is not always obvious . <\s>
<s> In fact , many other factos might be involved in this phenomenon . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I deem that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts more than learning facts . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , after having understand concepts , students may have the opportunity to apply these ideas to some specifics facts . <\s>
<s> In today 's world , it is highly advantageous to know a wide spectrum of knowledge . <\s>
<s> Since the chances that you may switch into another field increase day by day . <\s>
<s> What 's more , a Mr know-all seems to be welcomed everywhere . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my eye , however , it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to splurge too much efforts on unrelated subjects that may have nothing to do with your future life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , every human being 's energy is limited . <\s>
<s> Believe it or not , even a genius like Einstein could only dabble in other fields than physics , How can an ordinary doing too much in a short lifetime ? <\s>
<s> Focused efforts do not pay off for everyone , not to mention scattered time and energy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , to survive in this fullly competitive society and earn your bread in the rat race , you 'd better have your strenth . <\s>
<s> Specializing on one specific subject can make you an expert , broad knowledge of many academic subjects may not most the time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , brought up by our country , we are all eager to do something for her in the future . <\s>
<s> But without a deep knowledge in one specific area , how can we contribute largely to her ? <\s>
<s> Take my major , ocean-engineering as an example , without specialized devotion in the style and designing of ocean-structures , we ca n't go any further in our future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What 's more , there are too many things worth pondering over , if you are given the chance to pick some from an ocean of academic subjects , which ones are you going to selct ? <\s>
<s> You may probably get lost in the immense subjects , or achieve nothing wandering among these subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What I have argued above is based on my own experience , but we can neither go far when being tightly enclosed to a single subject . <\s>
<s> It is better to have some know-how about your related subjects , but our major time and energy should go to one specific area . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> `` Roman was not build in a day '' , so was the knowledge . <\s>
<s> Dedicate more to your target , and you can achieve more . <\s>
<s> Today car is considered a commodity : most people have one and even in a family of three or four people we can find more than two . <\s>
<s> Since the day it was invented , the production of car has increased in an incredible way : from a small factory with few people working in to the incredible phenomenon that we call `` mass production '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays , also , when we talk about car production , we must talk about mass customization : everybody can choose the car that best fits his own taste . <\s>
<s> At the time of Ford , if one would buy a Ford T he had to take a black one , because this was the only colour available . <\s>
<s> Today , instead , you can indicate which optionals you want in your car , such as CD player , MP3 player , air conditioned , ABS and so on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When we think about the future we must consider different problems about using cars . <\s>
<s> First of all , a big problem is represented by pollution , wich has raised in level in a dramatic way . <\s>
<s> A possible solution to this problem can be using hydrogen fuel instead of oil . <\s>
<s> In this way we can continue driving cars without polluting with smog the atmosphere . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another problem we must think about is traffic . <\s>
<s> Probably world population will grow in number as it has happened in the past . <\s>
<s> This means that more people will want to drive a car and so there will be more traffic . <\s>
<s> A solution to traffic can be building new streets or highways but time will arrive when we have to stop because we do not have space enough or because this solution is too expensive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , I think that the statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' is quiet correct . <\s>
<s> In fact , I believe that the problems I have already described will make people think about alternative solutions . <\s>
<s> Instead of using cars , for example , I think we are going to travel by a more developed and more efficient subway net . <\s>
<s> Also I think that trains and airplanes will become faster and grow in number . <\s>
<s> In Japan , for example , a magnetic train has developed that can reach incredible speed . <\s>
<s> I certainly thinks that having a broad range of knowloedge is better than knowing a only one subject deeply . <\s>
<s> However what I mean is little bit different than what it sounds like . <\s>
<s> For exmaple , If you are a leader of the orchestra , it is really important for you to know all the techniques that are used in leading a orchestra . <\s>
<s> However it can be better if that person knows how to play piano or other instruments , so he can at least knows that feeling and share the pressure of people who are following his signs . <\s>
<s> Therefore I conclude that knowing many academic subjects in one broad speicific subject would be the best . <\s>
<s> These are the examples . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Misto Takile , one of the most respected orchestra leader in Japan . <\s>
<s> legend creater of Yokimusa orchestra . <\s>
<s> Question is why was he so great ? <\s>
<s> He was a great leader , his techniques were concise and simple to follow , therefore it reduced the confusion of players who are following , but that did not made him legend . <\s>
<s> He had something more than that ; his ability of playing piano and violin was good as a professionals , He could teach a concert master how to play a piano or violion middle of the practice . <\s>
<s> He was also an expert in music history , He was able to , and actually give lecture about music history in Tokyo university . <\s>
<s> By knowing how to play instruments , he has share the feelings with players , and give them better , simpler leads . <\s>
<s> By knowing the music histroy , he understood better about the song . <\s>
<s> He knew broadly about his profession . <\s>
<s> That is what made him great . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Kim Mary , world famous zoologist who designed Nanjing Zoo . <\s>
<s> She has been famous because of her excellent and effective designs of zoos . <\s>
<s> However for her to reach this level , she had to finish 5 majors . <\s>
<s> First she has majored in medicine , second animal medical care , third three-dimension design , fourth building construction and last but not least , zoology . <\s>
<s> She has gone through all that to become the best in her area . <\s>
<s> She knows so broad about what she is doing , she could become the best in her subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore I conclude that knowing broad range about one subject is the best answer to the question . <\s>
<s> If you take little bits of everything , it does not give you depth understading and it does not help you a lot , However if you decrease the range and study deeply about all the subjects around your profession , it will give you lots of credit , it also might related to other big subjects as well . <\s>
<s> You can possibly argue that Einstein was a math maniac who did not know anything else except math and physic . <\s>
<s> But he was genius in a century , very exceptional case ! <\s>
<s> If you are not , and to be great in your area , I think it would be more beneficial for you to know broad range over your subject . <\s>
<s> As the saying goes `` ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS '' . <\s>
<s> Sucess lies in exploration involving risks . <\s>
<s> From the examples of the famous persons i infer that risks must be taken to achieve sucess . <\s>
<s> By keeping in view of the life history of many scientists sucess was achieved only by experimenting and not by just doing research on thier known ones . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The electricity which is an essential part of our life was a fruit of experimenting . <\s>
<s> It is this experimenting which brings the sucess . <\s>
<s> We can take the life of few succesfull persons such as the world 's richest man Mr BILLGATES and many more all of them were popular by trying out new ones rather than just doing what they know to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can even cite the example of the famous sports icon SAURAV GANGULY who was initially a football player but now he is famous for his cricketing capabilities . <\s>
<s> It is the experimenting of a new field which made him such a famous and sucessful person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Great persons have achieved the glimpses of sucess by trying out various fields . <\s>
<s> LATE Dirubai Ambani has a vast empire and has establised himself as a gaint in many fields . <\s>
<s> He has a lot of determination too along with experimentation of his thoughts in various fields and attained sucess . <\s>
<s> If NEIL ARMSTONG did not take the risk of travelling on to moon he might never have been in our pages of history , he might have just ben passed away as an ordinary astronomer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One must not get disturbed when he fails in his attempt rather he must shift to another field and try his capabilities . <\s>
<s> Our life is a short one and it needs to prove its worth . <\s>
<s> So we must acquire as much knowledge as possible in as many fields . <\s>
<s> But before trying out a new one we must learn some basic aspects of the field and know the keys to sucess in that field . <\s>
<s> As we all know failures are the stepping stones for sucess we must try out new things though there might be failures . <\s>
<s> So in this present generation sucess can be attained by trying out new things and taking the required risks . <\s>
<s> With the decision of the governor of California to sue the biggest car-makers , the burning issue of the environmental effects of car driving seems to occupy once again the front of the political stage . <\s>
<s> But this question is not a new one . <\s>
<s> Indeed , for many years now , we have seen the environmentalists to support the idea that we will no longer make an extensive use of ours cars if we want to secure the future of our planet . <\s>
<s> However , on the other hand , the petroleum and car-makers lobbyists try to explain us that we do not have any other altenative right now . <\s>
<s> To my mind I think ( or perhaps I hope ) that the number of what we called today cars will experience an important decrease while in the same time another kind of '' car '' will emerge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Indeed , with the rise of the new giants in the world economy I think that we will no have the choice to adapt our everyday life to environmental constraints or not . <\s>
<s> The reason here is simple : these new world champions are currently trying to narrow the gap between the Occidental standards of living and their standards of living . <\s>
<s> This implies that they will adopt the same means of transportation than in Occidental countries . <\s>
<s> In other words they would want to have one car per person . <\s>
<s> And we obviously know that this is impossible because the environmental damages would be so huge that it will but in danger humanity as a whole . <\s>
<s> But as far as I am concerned , I do not want to believe that we will slowly continue to destroy our planet without doing anything . <\s>
<s> I prefer rather to think that , like in the past , we are going to adapt to this new situation and that the human creativity will help us to find a solution . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And this solution will probably be the creation of a new kind of car , a pollution-free one . <\s>
<s> Precisely , if we took attention to what currently happens in the car-making industry we can see some evidences that this prediction will occurs . <\s>
<s> Effectively , we can already see some cars which are fueled with both gasoline and colza which accounts for more than twenty percent of the cars which are currently in use in Brazil . <\s>
<s> Moreover , it also exists some engines which are runned by hydrogen or electricity instead of fuel . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To put it in a nutshell I definitely prefer to think that human being will succeed in creating a pollution-free way of transportation , the '' new cars '' , rather than to think that we will all disappear because of our <\s>
<s> No one can escape the absorbing experience offered by traveling . <\s>
<s> There are lots of ways for people to travel around , such as traveling in a group or going on one 's own . <\s>
<s> Some people may like to travel on their own ; however , as far as I am concerned , not only obtaining better information about the places one vist can a travel in a group offers , but it will allow people know more friends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , the more likely one visits a place with a group , the more information he will konw as to this places , the better he will enjoy his journey . <\s>
<s> To acquire a full appreciation of what this means , we can turn to a common example . <\s>
<s> When a girl travals to Beijing , the capital of China , she will want to know the backgrouds of Beijing as much as possible . <\s>
<s> If she joins a group , she can ask the guide and then she will be acquainted with , for example , the history , the culture , the food and even the economy of Beijing . <\s>
<s> In addition , when she goes to the well-known place-The Great Wall , she also can enjoy so many funny stories about this place form the guide . <\s>
<s> Obviously , it is the guide that can permit a colorful trip . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> What is more , traveling with many people can also provide a potential function , that is , one can make more friends . <\s>
<s> For instance , in a trip to America , a chinese girl may share a lot of time with a boy from Japan . <\s>
<s> During the precious time , they will talk a lot concerning the beautiful sceneries they visit , and moreover they can communicate with each other about their own countries . <\s>
<s> After the journey , they may become good friends . <\s>
<s> In addition , with a group , one also can receive help easily when he encounters some troubles , including diseases . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , there are still other people who will maintian the advantages of traveling alone . <\s>
<s> The reason given by them reats on a belief that they will safe more time when a group of people discuss where to visit . <\s>
<s> Towards this opinion , I must say they will regret when facing difficulties which they could not handle by themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> From what has been discussed above , a concrete conclusion can been drawn that although much more time will be saved when traveling on one 's own , when it comes to better understanding the places one visit and more friends to enjoy the journey together , traveling in a group will carry more weight . <\s>
<s> With so mand benefits , why should n't people travel with a group ? <\s>
<s> I agree that for students understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts . <\s>
<s> A couple of examples drawn by my own experience convince me of this . <\s>
<s> In school , be it high school or university , students start familiarizing with a broad range of concepts that profoundly influence their ways of thinking and acting . <\s>
<s> Concepts and ideas provide an individual of a young age with a framework for thinking and following a certain methodology . <\s>
<s> For instance , in an art course , a student familiar with the underlying concepts of Cubism will be more able to draw inferences on other works of art of the same period than a student who has focused on the biographical data of an artist or on the names of his works . <\s>
<s> Moreover , the student who master the values who are at the basis of Cubism will be also able to relate them to similar currents of different fields , such as philosophy , literature , music . <\s>
<s> A student who has focused on pure facts could face some problems in linking up several facts if these belongs to different ` realms ' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although it is important to have a good knowledge of examples of specific facts or event , it is indispensable to understand concepts and ideas as they provide a good methodology for analyzing and understanding the reality as it appears to us , especially when we have no prior background information to rely on . <\s>
<s> In a media class , understanding which tools are needed to analyze a certain radio show can be useful in the event we have to design the analysis for a totally new media product from scratch , such as a new internet-based application or an upcoming information technology . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , although facts are part of the cultural ` baggage ' everyone uses everyday , can be considered of secondary importance than concepts and ideas which provide the framework for thinking and acting . <\s>
<s> I diasgee with the statement . <\s>
<s> According to me it is equally important for students to understand ideas and concepts and learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Mostly ideas and concepts are based on facts and if the students would n't know the facts how would they understand the ideas and concepts and build on them . <\s>
<s> Lets take the example of a nuclear fission/fusion reaction and the nuclear energy which is used to provide electricity to a large part of the world . <\s>
<s> If the person who came up with the idea of building a nuclear reactor would not have known the fact that nuclear fission/fusion reaction emits a large amount of energy he/she would not have come up with the idea of tapping this energy and concepting the idea of a nuclear reactor . <\s>
<s> Facts are like the foundation stones without which all ideas and concepts would be baseless . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Equally important is for the students to understand the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> If the students do n't understand the new ideas and concepts how will the world advance . <\s>
<s> All these technological innovations today have been possible because people have thought over the ideas , extensively researched the facts and then used both of them to their advantage . <\s>
<s> For example , if Alexander Graham Bell would not have had the idea that he could build telephone or Thomas Edison would not have the idea that electric bulb could be made then we still might have been living in a world full of darkness and this kind of communication would not have been possible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also if the students would not concentrate on ideas then they would just become a kind of robot with data/facts feeded in and with no innovative and imaginative ideas . <\s>
<s> Students also find an outflow of their emotions in the ideas they express . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , the students should concentate on both ; learn the facts first and then build ideas over it . <\s>
<s> Both are equally important . <\s>
<s> While it could be tempting to specialize only on one particular academic subject , a broad academic backgroung is a key tool for one 's personal and professional life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It can be easier , at first , to decide focusing on one particular academic subject . <\s>
<s> Indeed People who are done with their specific studies , feel comfortable in their subject . <\s>
<s> They can get a job pretty easily and can directly apply their knowledge . <\s>
<s> However during their education they missed many useful things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , having a general academic bakcground is one of the main reasons of success in science and in reasearch in particular . <\s>
<s> The most famous scientists had an amazingly broad academic background and this led to the most important dicoveries that human kind has experienced . <\s>
<s> They were able to adapt proved techniques to new fields , leading to rapid improvements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A broad general background is not just a required tool for scientists but for any person . <\s>
<s> This helps you think outside the box because you learnt different approaches and techniques that can be used to solve a problem that seemed new at first . <\s>
<s> People with a broad academic background are therefore able to adapt and respond more quickly and effectively to new situations than the rest of the people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A broad academic knowledge is also important because it gives you a strong cultural background . <\s>
<s> This is useful in many situations of your professional and professional life , because you will be able to understand these situations better . <\s>
<s> Hence you will be able to act in a clearer way than you would have if you did not have such a broad academic knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , a broad academic background is also important in society , to understand many different people with diverse jobs and cultures . <\s>
<s> This represents a key factor of adaptibility in society . <\s>
<s> In your job for instance , you will usually adapt faster that a person who studied a specific subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In sum , knowledge of many academic sbjects is a powerful tool in both your professional and personal life , even though specialising on one particular subject could be an asset for your first job . <\s>
<s> While during primary and secondary school time it is essential to gain a broad knowledge about many different scientific subjects , I think after aquiring this basic knowledge on various subjects it is equally vital to concentrate further on one specific subject for your further career . <\s>
<s> I therefore generally disagree with the statement and will explain my opinion in the following . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We live in a world that reflects high levels of specialization in every work branch you look upon . <\s>
<s> Even a computer expert today for example can be classified in various ways , according to the branch he works in . <\s>
<s> He could be a software designer or a hardware engineer for example . <\s>
<s> So even within an already very specialized branch , there are still more subdivisions . <\s>
<s> To keep up with those general movement of specialization in the working world , you just have to adapt and specialize on one subject or you will get left behind . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example related to this I can draw from my own experience - out of my own development within my academical career . <\s>
<s> I started studying forest sciences , then after four semesters I concentrated on zoology , and after another two semesters I focused further on entomology . <\s>
<s> I think this was a natural development and most students make this kind of progress . <\s>
<s> On the contrary , if you do not specialize in any kind of area within your studies , it might appear as if you are not interested enough in any subject . <\s>
<s> It then seems as if you are not going through any positive personal development . <\s>
<s> In my opinion therefore , someone who fails to specialize himself during his studies has missed an important chance already to shape his future and career . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Concluding , out of the reason expressed above , I disagree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Altough I have to admit that in early education a bias should lie on building up a broad knowledge on various subjects , in the major part of the rest of one 's life it is more important to specialize on one specific area of interest and to increase knowledge on that subject . <\s>
<s> This importance of specialization is heavily determined through the fast and innovative time we live in , which explores its subjects in ever greater detail and is in need of experts for that . <\s>
<s> There is some student who prefers to study without understand the principal ideas and concepts of what he is studying , because he thinks that it is unhelpfull or also a waiste of time ; other students , in the opposite way , prefer to pay more attention on the concepts rather than on the mere facts . <\s>
<s> I am in this second group for many reasons , whose the principal ones are three . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason is that I am not so able to study by heart , because of my often failing memory . <\s>
<s> Therefore I prefer to study the logical processes , the reason and the links of different events , rather than the mere facts and information about them . <\s>
<s> For example , studying history , I prefer to learn about the causes of a fact , while it is more difficult to me to study dates or events . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason , that can be linked with the previously one , is that , when a student understands the logical bases and the reasons of various facts , it will become easier to him to learn the facts that derived from that because he make on his brain a logical map of all the arguments he is studying . <\s>
<s> In history , for example , it is helpful to understand what event causes another one , and why ; in this way , it is easier to learn that the first one occurs before the second one , and thus it is easier to learn dates . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The last principal reason that makes me sure about my agreement with the statement is that to understand what a student is studying is more helpfull for him , not only for the graduation , but also and mostly for his life . <\s>
<s> In fact to understand something that also is not interesting improves people 's mind , and we can become smarter . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , though somebody thinks that we can learn only the facts from what we are studying , I am sure that it is more important and productive to understand ideas and concepts , and sometime it is also necessary to me ! <\s>
<s> I agree with the given statement that modern adverstisements do not reflect the real quality of a product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Since advertising is known it had the purpose to get the comsumers attention for a product , then cause interest for it which should end up in demand for the product and finally in the action of the buying process . <\s>
<s> So it is no wonder , that a company offering a product wants it to be presented in the most favourable way to raise the amount of people buying it . <\s>
<s> In only a very few cases the company and its advertising company care about the product shown as it is . <\s>
<s> From an economical point of view this behaviour seems apparently right , but from a moral point of view it is very debatable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A supporting role plays the development in the field of digitalization and technical progress . <\s>
<s> With contemporary techniques it is possible to refine pictures or movie clips by digital means . <\s>
<s> So in an advertisement for a lotion which proclaims clearer face skin , the picture of the campaign protagonist 's face might have been enhanced digitally . <\s>
<s> So it seems , that the lotion is effective because he or she has very clean skin in his facial area . <\s>
<s> That the picture does not reflect the true situation the consumer will get to know after he has bought the product , when the adverstiser has reached his goal - a sale . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinioen this emphazises the nowadays problem that the population - the consumers - are not critical enough towards information they receive via television or media in general . <\s>
<s> They believe in what they see without a critical attitude to it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion I want to say that from my point of view , its true that advertisements often make products seem better than they are , but thats okay because the advertiser acts in economical purpose . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowdledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because today a specialization is more useful than a broad knowdledge . <\s>
<s> However , it depends on the kind of job you want to do ; for a children 's teacher , for example , perhaps it is better to have a broad knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If you are specialized in one specific subject , only you and other few people are able to understand this subject in deep , and so some people will look for you and your knowdledge . <\s>
<s> Think about me : I am studying Material Science and Engineering ; I have n't a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but if someone has problems concerning with materials , I am the person for him and I will be payed lots of money for my suggestions . <\s>
<s> Thus , specializing is a good way to have better chances in finding work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Otherwise you must n't be an ignorant in the other subjects , because you are required to know what are you talking about , when you are speaking with another person . <\s>
<s> For example , if someone speaks to me about gears or engines at work , I have to know how they work properly , more or less . <\s>
<s> Also if someone ask me an information about an important philosoper like Barouch Spinoza , I am supposed to know something about him . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , I think that this broad knowdledge should been given to students by High Schools , and not by the University . <\s>
<s> If you have done your High School properly , you are supposed to have enough broad knowdledge to support all the discussion you will take in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , in my opinion it is better to attend the High School in a good way in order to achieve a broad knowdledge of many subjects , and then specialize in what you like the most when you are going to the University . <\s>
<s> It is said that the society has turned so busy and competing , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> This observation is not fully incorrect , but it is a rather shallow approach . <\s>
<s> One must see what young people actually plan to do and the way they do it to understand the phenomenon . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Since the competition in the society has increased sharply , young people these days have much more to do when they are not working than the young ones even as close as some decades ago , so they usually study and prepare to get jobs . <\s>
<s> This is why it seems that young people do not give enough time to halping the society . <\s>
<s> However , that is not all they do . <\s>
<s> There are many voluntary acts that university students organize or participate on their own . <\s>
<s> For example , Korean university and college students participate in education services organized by religious parties . <\s>
<s> Moreover , these days they tend to organize the service by themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The way of committing to the community also has changed . <\s>
<s> Young people from an older generation might have been involved in more general issues , such as politics , or national social movements . <\s>
<s> Young people nowadays , on the other hand , tend to specify on their specialties and focus on what they can do best , or at least on what they like . <\s>
<s> As seen above , students tend to teach the children who have hard time at school but cannot afford any other education . <\s>
<s> This trend goes into more specific areas . <\s>
<s> Students will involve with communities close to their majors , and young workers will help those who are closer to personal interests or hobbies . <\s>
<s> For example , students who major on agriculture will go on the fields and help farmers . <\s>
<s> This will enhance their knowledge on their major as well as help the community that involves them . <\s>
<s> Young workers interested in sports forming teams or coaching children for free will also be an example . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a whole , young people these days surely do not seem to give enough time to helping the community , but they sure do so in their own ways . <\s>
<s> It is only the outside that has changed due to the increased complexity and competition of the society , not the inside of the young peoples minds and souls . <\s>
<s> Their ways might have changed , but they still do like any other generation might . <\s>
<s> I fervently agree with this futuristic statement that in twenty years , fewer cars will be in use than there are today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , I believe that in the absence of effective and economic solutions to the problem of fuel today , with pollution and traffic on the rise , there is a pressing need to revitalise our public tranport system and take appropraite measures to discourage private transport . <\s>
<s> Cars , that are the symbol of private conveyance not only heavily contribute heavily to the increasing pollution in every major city of the world , but is also unnecessarily cluttering up the scarce space that we have left on the earth and its roads . <\s>
<s> This also is leading to a disastrous number of road accidents that are the cause of more deaths today than any epidemic or war . <\s>
<s> Twenty years from now , I do not see the severity of these problems alleviated unless we take some effective steps as reducing private transport , which I think is inevitable . <\s>
<s> In countries of Europe , the private transport even today is minimally used . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , with globalization all around us , with boundaries of distances , cultures and languages rapidly dissolving , I see the car getting obsolete simply because our needs would be larger . <\s>
<s> With technology , I believe that local distances would become inconsequential and cars would give way to more advanced form of travel . <\s>
<s> Already , the first space tourist has made a successful trip and is back ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With an Orwellian outlook of the world , I have a dystopic vision of the world ; a world where for stability and efficiency , the state would assume power , where perhaps personal expression is rendered unimporant and the society or the community is primary . <\s>
<s> In such a society , the car which is basically a symbol of prestige and status has absolutely no space . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today , where we stand , with the all pervasive Internet growing beyond limits , in twenty years the world would be more of a virtual community . <\s>
<s> You and I would have a more predominant virtual existence than a real one . <\s>
<s> Our basic needs to survive everyday , chores that require us to move around on a daily basis would be conveniently done away with with the virtual world . <\s>
<s> Believe me , we 'd be thriving on our virtual entity a lot more , depending on it for our daily needs without moving an inch ! <\s>
<s> What does a car have to do in such a scenario ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> With the above points , I have made a cogent and strong statement asserting that cars have no place in our world twenty years from now . <\s>
<s> One will succeed in life only if something new and risky is experimented . <\s>
<s> Hard work is the key to success . <\s>
<s> Successful people try out new things and also take risks to know something or complete the task rather than doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> The following reasons and examples which i can give are as follows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Success depends on experimenting new things even though they are risky . <\s>
<s> When one know something about the task well before persuing the same , there is no need to concentrate much and put on hard work to finish the task . <\s>
<s> He can do things easily and with in no time . <\s>
<s> But when he/she is choosing a work based on risk it gives much interest and need lot of hard work to go on with it and succeed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , consider a poor citizen want to get in to the Indian Cricket team . <\s>
<s> He is capable of playing well and got much confidense . <\s>
<s> But , even though he know well that it is not easy to get in to the team as he cant effort huge amount for the coaching fees . <\s>
<s> He need lot of money and many recomendations to go through . <\s>
<s> After knowing all these things , when he still shows interest , and by taking risk he moves forward , he will definitely achieve his goal . <\s>
<s> This way when one is taking risk and put effort he will definitely move forward in life to know and to do things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consider another example of Bill Gates , the very famous well know person in the world . <\s>
<s> He is one of the successful person in the world as he developed the windows operating system which are being used by wide range of people . <\s>
<s> He dont know whether his discoveries or developments will succeed or not , but still he took risk and developed another operating system which is named user friendly one called ( Windows XP ) which is well developed and being used by many users in the present world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By the above examples and facts i agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Successful people should take risk to go further and find new things . <\s>
<s> If they stand back , we would hav missed many new things and inventions till now . <\s>
<s> Traveling is for me the best way to get to know newpeople and their culture . <\s>
<s> By traveling you will know different places and experience the trip in your own skin is something that you will never forget . <\s>
<s> You can read many books about a particular place but it is only when you travel that you understand the culture , architecture , etc. of that place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide and I totally disagree with that statment . <\s>
<s> I think that the best way to travel is on your own with a map . <\s>
<s> I have several reasons for holding that opinion . <\s>
<s> First of all , traveling in groups with a tour guide does not give you the freedom to move around that you might want . <\s>
<s> When you travel by yourself you decide where to go and when . <\s>
<s> For example I remmember when I traveled in a group of fifteen persons with a tour guide in Paris four years ago . <\s>
<s> I planned and scheduled all my trip with this group and its guide because I did not want to travel alone . <\s>
<s> It turned out that I had a really bad experience with them . <\s>
<s> I was required to get up very early in the morning because the excursions started at sunrise . <\s>
<s> Imagine that experience for me that I am not a morning person ! . <\s>
<s> Moreover I did not get along with the people in the group . <\s>
<s> There was a big age difference that conditioned all our decisions . <\s>
<s> When I wanted to go to a pub at night the rest of the group preferred to stay at the hotel playing cards . <\s>
<s> I think they did n't realize they were in Paris . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , traveling in groups with guide is far more expensive than traveling by yourself . <\s>
<s> You can decide where to eat and how much you want to spend if you travel alone . <\s>
<s> You know the amount of money that you have and you know how you want to spend it . <\s>
<s> For example , you can decide to pay a boat around the river instead of paying a museum . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up I think that traveling alone far outweigh the fact of traveling in groups . <\s>
<s> I must also say that the information that a tour guide can give you during the trip can also be found in many travel guides and books . <\s>
<s> So you might want to read a little bit before departuring . <\s>
<s> In this essay I will write about my opinion of a risky attitute of a person , if it is rather good or bad . <\s>
<s> In my opinion the way of being successful is parted into two parts . <\s>
<s> One part is that a person , who wants to be successful , has to risk something , or , try something new . <\s>
<s> Without that , the person will always stay on one point and will not move on . <\s>
<s> The person will not get any further on the persons privacy , nor at work . <\s>
<s> The person shows that he really wants to achieve somthing by risking something that is really important for him . <\s>
<s> As an example someone , who has his job as journalist for a newspaper since 20 years and always wirtes about the weather . <\s>
<s> He has a new idea which could mean to lose his job and still presents it to his boss . <\s>
<s> He risks his own job , but he could also get further in his carrier . <\s>
<s> By being risky , the person get something special , because not everyone does something new , which no one tried before . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand the boss for an example has to count on you . <\s>
<s> So if you try something new and you faile , you can lose your job or do not get the chance to move on in your carrier . <\s>
<s> To be successful means also teamwork . <\s>
<s> When a person tries to be special and does not work with the others , because he tries to be better than them , than his success will stop at the point , when he needs his colleagues . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , a risky person has to know where he has to stop and when he has to work with his colleagues . <\s>
<s> When he follows those points ( which I mentioned before ) he has the ability to be successful . <\s>
<s> Some people say that the youngsters do n't have any interests in helping their communities any more but grabbing their own ambitions , while others argue that the young of these days are more motivated to give help for their communities . <\s>
<s> Considering the growing passions of young valenteers , however , I strongly desagree with the statement written above . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For the first , there are social advantages which encourage the youngsters to help their communities . <\s>
<s> In specific , since participating in local communities can provide the youngs with some neccesary and useful experiences from real world , such as skills needed for processing certain job , taking part in local activities does n't mean only doing bothering tasks for the young valenteers any more . <\s>
<s> For instance , I once took part in local festival as an staff . <\s>
<s> As there are so many foreigners who visited in my community , all I should do was rushing here and there , giving free interpretation . <\s>
<s> Even though it was tough and did't provide me any money , I could more valuable things through that event , Improvement in my English interpretation , and social skills . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On top of that , the youngsters nowadays are tend to dedicate themselves for what they put their values on . <\s>
<s> According to the Department of Labor of Korea , in 2005 , more than 60 % of colleage students have experiences of valenteering in their local needs . <\s>
<s> What is more , they stated that what they wanted to acquire through their activities was not money but their self improvement . <\s>
<s> This case clearly represent the fact that they are now put their values on not only material things but also the mental things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is an old Korean saying goes like this ; Helping neighbors is as valuable as helping one 's own siblings . <\s>
<s> This represent the idea that giving one 's hand for others need is a kind of qualification to be an well rounded person . <\s>
<s> Thus , as long as the importance of cooporations such as giving one 's hand for their comunities exist , the active participation of youngsters will never be limited . <\s>
<s> Many of the companies believe that , the advertisement for the a product is crucial , vital for its presentation to the customers . <\s>
<s> And most of the customers believe the scenes created by the advertisements wil come true when they buy this particular product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Considering the reasons behind these advertising activities makes me to believe that too much of advertisement about one particular item indicates that it should have at least defects to cover . <\s>
<s> Addition to this , I will support my opinion based on the facts that ; the life styles that are promoted by the companies , the reliability of the information presented and the threats to the uniqueness of our lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I am against the notion of the belief that , buying a product will change my life forever ( until the new product comes into scene ) . <\s>
<s> Many of the women customers believe that , by using a particular brand of shampoo , they will have a hair like Rapunzel , or the fourty-year-old women will become `` chicks '' by using anti-aging facial creams . <\s>
<s> So do we have fourty-year-old women around ? <\s>
<s> with wrinkles ? <\s>
<s> Subsequently , the advertisements try to sell the consumers the life style that is shown on the TV , not just the product itself . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I am sure about that , the scenes we watch are not totally true . <\s>
<s> The photography of the colorful , delightful food are mostly shot at the time when the food is half cooked . <\s>
<s> Also , the hair in the shampoo advertisement was first cleaned , polished and finally probably made with a sophisticated hair designer . <\s>
<s> Every type of hair will look as the same as it appeared in the AD , if processed that much . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Consequently , advertisements are harmful for our unique lives . <\s>
<s> Out traditional clothes , our grandmother medications , all .. <\s>
<s> The colors people like to wear should not be changed over seasons with fashion . <\s>
<s> Do you belive that we wear the 60s clothes nowadays because of the advertisement we saw on each day , regarding the new fashion of the year ? <\s>
<s> Everyone in this world will soon wear a jean in the future . <\s>
<s> It is not so diffucult to estimate what we will be wearing in the next future , just the same type of cloth . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , the advertisements are harmful for our lives , in the way that the life styles that they offer , the scenes that they create and threatens the uniqueness of our lives . <\s>
<s> I completely agree with the statement according to which advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> What make me think that is my reflections on the marketing strategies used by companies during my marketing class . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisement strategy is based usually on the following three pillars , making the packaging of the product agressive , by creating a new consumption trends that do not necessary correspond to the real needs of consumers , and by making the product looks the unique one adapt for the costumer needs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All the above mentioned pilars of marketing concentrate the effort on improving the perception of the product not the inner characteristics of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Does improving the attractive capacity of the packaging material in which the product will be sold will improve it qualities ? <\s>
<s> I am convinced that it will make only the consumer choose it even if it has a higher price or lower quality . <\s>
<s> The colours of package will attract the eyes of the consumers from other similar product that could be a better choice in terms of quality and price . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The consumption trends have to do with a certain image created for the ideal consumer of the product , this can be achieved by using very famous artists or singers in promoting the product or by the use of very beautifull women or handsome men , according to the product consumer target , which implicitly gives the idea that if you use this product you will be act as your favorite actor or singer . <\s>
<s> Again it has not anything to do with the product itself , it is only a created and virtual image . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The last pilar is making the consumer think that the product is done to satisfy his or her needs as if in the mass production era it is possibile to have an unique product made for an uniqe consumer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my point of view the best way to deal with advertisement is try to consider shopping as an activity necesary to satisfy the own needs and not like a tool to look more trendy or more modern , <\s>
<s> `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' - a challenging topic to discuss , but also a question that becomes more and more important . <\s>
<s> Our society , especially the german society , gets older and older . <\s>
<s> Since the birth rate decreases from year to year , we will confront an `` aging '' population in the future . <\s>
<s> In contrast to emerging and growing cultures like the chinese or the indian , we will confront upcoming problems a lot earlier . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But what defines your ability to enjoy life ? <\s>
<s> Does age actually have an impact on the way you live your own life ? <\s>
<s> Do factors like physical ability , experience and your current situation in life affect your ability to enjoy ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Since I am just 22 years of age - I know how much fun it is to be young and how easy it is to enjoy life when there are no physical boundaries or limits . <\s>
<s> You do not confront the boundaries of movement , orientation and sight a 80-year old man would have to live with . <\s>
<s> When you are young , you are at a point of time where you are constantly experiencing new and interesting things . <\s>
<s> And the younger you are , the less you think about the future . <\s>
<s> Everything is taken care of by your elders - you do not need to worry about anything . <\s>
<s> In my opinion this is the perfect base to start an enjoyable life . <\s>
<s> So especially when you are really young , it is a lot easier to enjoy life as it is . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But what happens when you are growing up ? <\s>
<s> There are many , many events in life that change your current situation dramatically . <\s>
<s> You live in a period of constant change . <\s>
<s> From day to day you are confronted with more and more problems . <\s>
<s> Starting with puberty , life gets more challenging from day to day . <\s>
<s> Your first relationship , your first break-up , your first day of school , your first bad grade , your first car , your first major accident - with all the positive things happening in our youth - you are now confronted new and unkown situations which might prevent you from enjoying life as you did when you were really young . <\s>
<s> And the older you get , the more you think about how easy everything was when you were just a kid ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But is getting old really that discouraging ? <\s>
<s> Does the fact that you might not be able to do everything you want , be it because you are physically `` handicapped '' or your current position in life , prevent you from enjoying life ? <\s>
<s> I think , as you grow older and older , your preferences change . <\s>
<s> Activities like going to clubs or playing around and being physically successful do not define your life any more . <\s>
<s> At a certain point of time , be it the retirement-age , different things make you feel content and happy . <\s>
<s> Seeing your own children grow up , spending time with people that are close to you or just being able to be a `` good advisor '' to the younger generation might become ways to make your day . <\s>
<s> Since life has become more and more stable and changes dont happen that quickly anymore , you get the chance to view life in a totally different way and thus you become able to benefit from different things and enjoy your life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion not the age but your own character , your own `` soul '' define wether you can enjoy life or not . <\s>
<s> Even the richest man or a child that gets everything it can possibly imagine might be the sadest and loneliest people in the world . <\s>
<s> Whether you are old or young , rich or poor - happiness and the ability to enjoy your life are not mainly influenced by external facts - what really plays a role is the person you are and how you see life itself . <\s>
<s> The question if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years , than there are in use today , is a controversal topic . <\s>
<s> People may argue that cars get abundand in the futur due to further development of alternative transportation methods or by concerns about the environment . <\s>
<s> I however , do not agree with this staatment . <\s>
<s> I even think cars get more and more important and that car use will increas in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The use of cars is an still will be important especially for working people . <\s>
<s> Statistiks show that people have to travell longer and longer distances to their workplace , and in the future this distance will still increase . <\s>
<s> A lot of people move out to the suburbs and consequently have a longer way to work each day . <\s>
<s> I think this development will continue in the futur and will increase the cars in use . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore flexibility is a charakteristik that is getting very important these days . <\s>
<s> Companys want there employee to be flexible and let them travel for work a lot . <\s>
<s> This flexibility can be given by the car and will increase its use . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another important reason why there will be more cars in use in twenty days than today is that the population on earth is increasing rapidly . <\s>
<s> If population is increasing the use of cars will increase as well because more people lead to more cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But not only workingconditions and the increasing population are reasons agains the reduction of cars in the futur . <\s>
<s> As well the vacationhabbit of people will lead to the opposit . <\s>
<s> As the world gets closer togehter by globalisation , open boarders and a common currency for example , travelling gets a lot easier than it was in the past . <\s>
<s> People use this advantages and travell a lot and I think travelling by car will get more and more popular . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Last but not least I argue that because of new technologies and production methods , cars get cheaper in the futur and therefore get accesable to more people which will defenetly not decrease the cars in use . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For these reasons I stated above I think the statement that cars in use will be fewer in the futur is incorrect . <\s>
<s> `` YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DO '' AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT . <\s>
<s> LIFE IS A MIXTURE OF EXPERINCES AND WE PASS THROUGH THIS WAY OF LIFE ONLY ONCE . <\s>
<s> WHT EVER WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO IT NOW , IN THIS SHORT TIMEOF OUR LIFE HERE . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> YOUNG PEOPLE CERTAINLY HAVE MORE ENTHUSIASM , ENERGY , ZEAL AND INTEREST TO LEARN , EXPLORE AND FACE THE ADVENTURE THAT LIFE GIVES THEM . <\s>
<s> YOUNG MINDS ARE FRESH AND UNEXPERIENCED AND HAVE LOADS OF CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES THAT THEY HAVE TO HANDLE WHERE AS OLDER PEOPLE HAVE LOTS OF MATURITY IN LIFE AND HAVE ALREADY LIVED AND FACE SUCH CHALLENGES . <\s>
<s> SO YOUNGSTERS HAVE MORE PROSPECTS OF EXPERIENCING LIFE AND ENJOYING IT TO THE MOST . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I WOULD LIKE TO CITE AN EXAMPLE FOR THE ABOVE , TAKING INTO PICTURE A PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BE A FATHER FOR THE FIRST TIME . <\s>
<s> THE AMOUNT OF EXCITEMENT HE WOULD SHOW WOULD BE MUCH GREATER THAN THE PERSON WHO MUST HAVE ALREADY HAD THREE CHILDREN AND EXPECTING ONE MORE . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE DROOPING OLDER ONES IN TERMS OF THEIR PHYSICAL ENERGY AND STAMINA . <\s>
<s> THUS , THEY ENJOY LIFE TO A GREATER EXTENT WHEN COMPARED TO OLDER PEOPLE . <\s>
<s> FOR EXAMPLE , A YOUNG BOY MAY ENJOY PLAYING , DOING EXCERCISE LIFTING HEAVY WEIGHTS . <\s>
<s> WHEREAS AN OLD MAN CANNOT ENJOY LIFTING WEIGHTS AND RUNNING AROUND DUE TO HIS PHYSICAL WEAKNESS . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> YOUNG PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING NEW TO EXPERIENCE . <\s>
<s> HENCE IT CAN BE STATED THAT THEY ENJOY LIFE MORE . <\s>
<s> BUT TAKING AN OTHER ASPECT WHERE OLDER PEOPLE STILL HAVE YOUNGER MINDS , THEY DO HOLD EXPERIENCE AT HAND BUT ENJOY LIFE GUIDING YOUNG ONES AND CORRECTING THEM . <\s>
<s> THEY ENJOY LIFE WITH AN OPTIMISTIC ATTITUDE THAT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN LIFE AND EVERYTHING CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH A DETERMINATION . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> THE YOUNGER PEOPLE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OF A STRONGER MEMORY OVER OLDER ONES . <\s>
<s> AS LIFE PASSES THE MEMORY WEARIES OFF AND OLDER PEOPLE LOOSE THE CAPACITY OF DERIVING THE JOY THAT LIFE POTRAYS TO THEM . <\s>
<s> HENCE I WOULD RESTATE MY AGRREMENT SUPPORTING THAT YOUGSTERS ENJOY LIFE TO THE MAXIMUM CONSIDERING THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STABILITY AND BUDDING MINDS . <\s>
<s> In order to understand something globaly , we should learn facts as well as understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> However , sometimes understanding is better than learning , or in some cases it is the contrary . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is important for students to understand ideas and concepts , because this will help them to memorise the facts and understand other isuues related to the subject they are studying . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , when a student fully understands a mathematical theory , he or she will be able to resolve many related mathematical problems easier . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For some students , it is much easier to understand ideas than to learn facts by heart . <\s>
<s> Others , on the other hand , prefer to memorise facts rather than trying to understand concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , there is no general rule stating what is more important for students . <\s>
<s> It depends on the class the students are taking , wether it is more important to understand concepts or to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In History class for example , learning about events and facts is more important than understanding them , it is even impossible to understand some issues in history . <\s>
<s> Whereas in a computer , physic or a biology class for example , students are asked mainly to understand theories and concepts , they should be able to analyse data and give solutions and results making use of what they understood . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , there are some classes that requier more learning than understanding , and other classes that requier more understanding than learning . <\s>
<s> Although much people may agree with this statement I disagree with it for several reasons . <\s>
<s> The first point is that there are no reasons to support this statement . <\s>
<s> Why should an older person enjoy life less than younger people ? <\s>
<s> Older humans have the same possibilities to enjoy life as younger do . <\s>
<s> They are able to go shopping , to go to cinema or whatever they want . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore I may say that older people enjoy life more than younger do because generally they have more money and know exactly what they want . <\s>
<s> Because I am young I have to try out what I like and what I dislike . <\s>
<s> For example , if I travel to Austria and after the first three days I realize that I do not like this country . <\s>
<s> In this situation the whole holiday will be bad . <\s>
<s> If I had been older , I would have known that and would not been traveled there . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is also the fact that older people are having more pastime when they are free from working . <\s>
<s> So they have much more time to do what they want . <\s>
<s> Due to this they would enjoy their life more than younger people which still have duties like going to school or working . <\s>
<s> Moreover , younger people are stressed more often because they want to have success in their jobs or in school . <\s>
<s> So , even if there is time to do something enjoyable , they just will not do this because they are too stressed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The third reason why I disagree with this statement is because of my own experiences . <\s>
<s> Nearly all the older people I know are enjoying their life very much . <\s>
<s> My mother is an example for that . <\s>
<s> Since she is older than fifty , she is more often in bars and clubs than I am . <\s>
<s> She also has many friends and enough money to do whatever she wants . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> My last point deals with the danger of deseases in age . <\s>
<s> I do not think that this fact consequently prevents older people from enjoying their life . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , knowing that life is short and may also end in the next years is an argument for enjoying life . <\s>
<s> In that situation people perhaps will care about their time and use it as well as possible . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the end I think that older people may enjoy their life even more than younger people do . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . <\s>
<s> I think that life is about risk taking and when you do not take risks you let opportunities pass you by . <\s>
<s> If you were bold enought to take the risk and you managed to accomplish it in a succesful way you will have gained a lot , yet if you did not accomplish it in an accurate way you still gained a lesson . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Doing what you already know how to do well is a convenient way of spending your life , yet by the time you are older you will realized that you could have made much more . <\s>
<s> By not taking risks you are sure that you will not have negative consequences but , you are also sure that you will not gain more that you have in that moment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is well known that most of the discovers and inventions that build the theories we use today , were discovered by researches that took many risks . <\s>
<s> For example , say you are making a research project and you know from theory that by letting the variables unchanged you have big chances to get a certain result . <\s>
<s> If you continue with the experiment in this way , you will prove the result you expected , and will have a research project that proved something that was know before . <\s>
<s> This does not mean it is not valuable , on the contrary this type of research is also valuable since theories were made years ago and there may be some conditions today that can change the results . <\s>
<s> But what if you decide to change a variable and see what it happens , you might be discovering the cure for aids , for example . <\s>
<s> In cases like this , taking risks can lead you to succesful events . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is a mexican saying that states `` if you do not take risks you have less opportunities to win '' . <\s>
<s> And it is quite true since by not taking risks you diminish your poll of opportunities . <\s>
<s> It is also true that taking risks do not guarantee , every time , a positive outcome it may in fact turn out to be a negative one ; yet you will not know what would happen until you try it . <\s>
<s> Joy of life has diffrent meanings for every and each one of us . <\s>
<s> Many of us think that young people enjoy life more than old people do . <\s>
<s> I totaly agree with this point for the following reasons : Younger people are healthy , they have tasted less pain than older people , and they have less constrains and responsibilities in their lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , young people enjoy a healthy body , in most cases disease free , which allowes them to participate in many diffrent events . <\s>
<s> We rarely ever see an old man surfing . <\s>
<s> Also sports world wide is more concerned about young people rather than old . <\s>
<s> People who are Fourty years old and above never have the fitness to compete over sports titles . <\s>
<s> One the other hand , Young people enjoy body fitness . <\s>
<s> How many times did we see a Fifty years old win a race with a Twinty years old man ? . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , young people have been through less problems than old people , daily life problems does not effect them both the same way . <\s>
<s> young people do n't usually have problems at work . <\s>
<s> In addition to that , problems are easy to be forgeten when we are young . <\s>
<s> Young men can easily get over a fight for example . <\s>
<s> On the other hand older people are more exposed to domistict husbend and wife fights , a man or a women who lives in such a situation can never be as happy as a single young person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , Young people are more free , they have less responsibilties . <\s>
<s> For example , young poeple wo n't have to worry about paying rent . <\s>
<s> Indepdency is another factor . <\s>
<s> In early age people wo n't have to worry about other family members . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , old people have many responsibilities that they can not neglect , they have to provide food and shelter to their families , which is another thing young people wo n't have to worry about . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the end , it is easy to notice that life is way easier when we are young . <\s>
<s> Based on my experience , when i was a teenager i enjoyed unlimited amout of fun and happeness , the reason behind that was the free , healthy life and absence of responsibilities . <\s>
<s> That is why Youngsters are happier than old people . <\s>
<s> A person that is successfull or wants to be successfull likes to try new things and take risks in life instead of doing only what they know they are good at . <\s>
<s> This might be because a truly successfull person knows that an unending process of learning is what being successfull is all about . <\s>
<s> When you try new things you learn and see things you did not know about and your perception becaomes wiser , your knowledge is expanded . <\s>
<s> When you do something only because you know you are skilled at it you are denying your your chance to explore the other possibilities and innovations the world can offer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , I consider my mom to be a very successfull and lawyer and human being . <\s>
<s> She is a person that has travelled to many countries , and consequently has been to three different continents . <\s>
<s> She has seen many cultures , even experienced many cultures and has perceived the definition of justice other countries have . <\s>
<s> She has gained experience because of this and implemented it in her work , she even visited prisons to get to know cases and approach the venezuelan legal system a different . <\s>
<s> All of these experiences made her a successfull lawyer that even worked with the government and defended well known officials of the government . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the otherhand , one can be and wants to be successfull in many aspects of life , especially , in one very essential which is love . <\s>
<s> My cousin had a crush on girl for three years and acted like her best friend when in fact he loved her . <\s>
<s> He was an amazing friend and was very good in that position , he resignated to being that because he was afraid if he told her his feelings she would reject him . <\s>
<s> Finally , after me and his friends convinced him , he took the risk of asking her and telling her what he truly felt . <\s>
<s> She felt the same about , so by being strong and courageous enough my cousin felt happy and very successfull . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Adquiring experience by trying new things sometimes usefull , sometimes even a waste of time makes you grow as a person and increases your knowledge . <\s>
<s> You more power in your life to make decisions , embrace changes and know what happiness truly is for you . <\s>
<s> To try new things you have to have courage , to be determined and to make risks . <\s>
<s> In taking risks you can lose but can also win and know instead of wondering . <\s>
<s> First of all , it should be made clear what we intend with broad knowledge and specific knowledge of subjects . <\s>
<s> If for broad knowledge we imagine the situation of a student that attends spare courses on random subjects like in Sociolgy and Mathematics or in Anatomy and Mass Communicationb whilst for specific knowledge a student that takes courses focused in Social studies , limiting the extension of his study only to courses that are strictly related like Sociology and Antropology , i think i would prefer to have a specific knowledge . <\s>
<s> The reason is that a superficial overview on different subjects can result extremely fragmented and scattered and it can bring the person to be unsure and uncomfortable with all the topics . <\s>
<s> Moreover , without following any structure , the student can be lost in the vagueness and wide-spread extension of knowledge , he could wander from one field to another without catching a concrete point . <\s>
<s> Therefore , i would rather agree more to a specific approach on learning knowledge . <\s>
<s> A specific approach focuses the attention of the student only to some aspects of knowledge . <\s>
<s> This gives to the student confidence with the topic and the skill to treat and work out news insights . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , if for `` broad knowledge '' we intend a structure of courses that follows a project that goes in and out from different sciences , i think i will prefer better a broad knowledge . <\s>
<s> I would explain this idea with an example of a field that is highly related and interconnected with different branches of knoweldge : cognitive science . <\s>
<s> The aim of cognitive science is to discover the functioning of the brain . <\s>
<s> In order to do this the only knowledge brought by Neuroscience will not be enough . <\s>
<s> It needs supports from many other disciplines very different in respect with each others . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus , sometime broad knowledge is necessary to have a better glance over topics that are too much complex and that cannot be treated with a specific and focused background . <\s>
<s> Since the first car was created , the number of cars have increased every year . <\s>
<s> From my point of view that will be the same in the next years . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Basically i belive the social demand will going on increasing . <\s>
<s> City are overcrowed and we tend to emigrate from the cityies to areas closed to the city but more calm and sometimes with less pollution that the city one . <\s>
<s> If we live some kilometres far to the city we will need a transport to go there . <\s>
<s> There is public transport , but usually it is expensive and less confortable than a car . <\s>
<s> Human love to be confortable even if that damage for instance the environement . <\s>
<s> Because of that , because we love confortability , we will usually choose our own car in stead of the public transport to move ourselfs . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I belive in several years a less-polluted car will be created . <\s>
<s> People are more concern with the environement than years ago . <\s>
<s> We think more in the environement , damage , pollution causes , consecuences . <\s>
<s> In fact , scientifcs are reaserching a way to built car that emited less gases to the atmosphere , as electrical car . <\s>
<s> If they achive their aim , we will have `` healthy '' car and we will not have moral conflicts in uses them whenever we wanted . <\s>
<s> I mean , that maybe now , there are peolple worried about the pollution and because of that he , she doenot take car as much she woukd like . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> IN conclusion , because of the arguments aboved mentioned , ( there are other but the time is out ) in my opinion we could see much car running the roads that the number of them tha we can see now . <\s>
<s> Iam totally disagree with this statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . '' <\s>
<s> Car , which was the travelling mode ( venegance ) for the privileged class in early 20th century , but with the growth of the technology now the cars is there in every house and in every streets . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The new technology makes the use of car more reliable and inexpensive . <\s>
<s> After twenty years , the use of cars will definetely increase with the inovation of new new automobile technologies . <\s>
<s> The use of solar car will replace the use of fuel feeding cars . <\s>
<s> The modern technology made solar cars but still it is rare to find them in streets . <\s>
<s> Because they are very expensive . <\s>
<s> But after twenty years this expensive mode will also be available at reliable rates . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The constructions of fly overs , underground tunnels and the highways were help the people to go from one place to another with saving their time which otherwise they lost by hanging out in the heavy rush . <\s>
<s> But how the people will travel from one place to another ? <\s>
<s> They will prefer for self vehicles . <\s>
<s> And if the solar cars which will be reliable to get then why the use of cars after twenty years will decrease ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Every one wants to live a fast and speedy life . <\s>
<s> Then why they will waste their time by depending on buses , trains . <\s>
<s> They will try to have their own vehicle and the vehicle which is comfortable and inexpensive . <\s>
<s> After twenty years the car rates will defenitely be reduced and every one will have their own car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The problem after twenty years for using the cars will be of fuel , which is probably at the stage of extinction . <\s>
<s> But technology is make the solution of this problem also . <\s>
<s> The solar fuel , the energy trapped by solar module which stores the energy and transforms this energy to electrical energy . <\s>
<s> So the use of solar cars will be both the solution for fossil fuel extinction as well as for pollution free fuel . <\s>
<s> So in the next twenty years the people will make use of solar vehicles and if the solar cars will be available then why not solar cars , which is more reliable , inexpensive after twenty years , pollution free vehicle and free of petrol or any other fossil fuels . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it is quite definite that after twenty years the use of cars will increase only because of new techology like solar technology , automobile technology and also because of construction of big big flyovers , tunnels and highways . <\s>
<s> The life of the people after twenty years will be more fast and hence the use of these solar cars will increase . <\s>
<s> Advertisement is made to sell a product to the masses not to point out insufficiencies . <\s>
<s> I completely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> The truth is very helpful most of the time but in the case of trying to sell a product one should not rely on telling the truth . <\s>
<s> My point is not that lying should become common in advertisement , although it already might be in some cases , but there are more important things to look at when trying to convince a customer of bying ones product . <\s>
<s> The human eyes are one of the most important sense to everyone and advertisement should use that to get their viewers ' attention . <\s>
<s> Let us take a milk commercial on tv as an example . <\s>
<s> If the commercial would just show me a cow in a huge milking facility squeezed between others and being connected to a milking machine , that would not make me want to buy milk at all . <\s>
<s> The important thing is to attract the potential customer by stimulating their senses , for example with perfect images on the tv . <\s>
<s> So , if i would then see a healthy looking cow on a green swiss alm being milked by a handsome young farmer ( or for the men , by a gorgeous young famer ) it would make me more convinced that this product is being produced in this way and therefore is much healthier and over all , it just makes me feel good about myself just looking at that postcard image . <\s>
<s> Other examples of advertisements which show fitness products for example always give the image of heathy lean young people feeling good about themselves and having fun in their life because they are using the product which is being advertised . <\s>
<s> This image of a perfect body , and the thinking , that this product might help me to achieve my goal and look like these people on tv , makes me more likely to by that product . <\s>
<s> People don not want to see the truth in advertisements , especially on tv , they have that already every day . <\s>
<s> They want to be guided , how to escape that dull life and achieve things , how to lose ten pounds , how to have the most fun with the newest computer , or how to reach their dream vacation destination . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , advertisement is all about appealing to the senses . <\s>
<s> Since only sight and hearing can be reached by advertisement , the industry also uses these features in their advertisements extensively to persuade somebody to by their product . <\s>
<s> It is all about getting attention . <\s>
<s> Will the number of cars in use be lower in twenty years from now ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe the answer is probably no . <\s>
<s> What element could support the theory in question ? <\s>
<s> Maybe the decrease in natural resources available to produce oil and finally feed our cars . <\s>
<s> In fact this problem is already being assessed by car manufacturers and oil makers and we can say based on real examples such as Brasil that Colza based oil can effectively replace standard petrol products . <\s>
<s> Electricity or hydrogen engines can also be an answer to oil unavailability . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second argument , linked with the first one , is the consciousness of our civilizations regarding car impact on pollution and environment . <\s>
<s> This is a good point , but we can see this feeling growing today only in countries were almost all the active part of the population has one or more cars . <\s>
<s> And these civilizations are also the ones having less demographic expansion . <\s>
<s> In other parts of the world like Africa , India or China there are still a lot of people dreaming about having a car , the rapid growth of their population will have a huge impact on car annual sales . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion another element which could be also utilized is the development of alternative ways of tranportation . <\s>
<s> I belive this can be true in big cities were traffic jams and pollution are not good advocates for cars . <\s>
<s> But we can oppose the fact that it 's being the case for the last 10 years and the decrease in numbers of cars never happened . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also in more rural regions , any public transportation system will be efficient enough to replace the cars . <\s>
<s> And the feeling of individual liberty that the car brings will not be found while sitting in an overcrowded bus which stops only in pre-designated spots . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And to finish , the special link - almost human - between some men and their cars , the car being the external image of their supposed success , is not a sign tha indicates a potential decrease in the numbers of cars in the next 20 years ... <\s>
<s> I do not agree in total with the statement mentioned because there are two sides of the coin associted with issue . <\s>
<s> Let us discuss those issues in agreement with the topic . <\s>
<s> The world has been transformed in to a global village . <\s>
<s> Life seems to getting busier and busier everyday with the youth playing a pivotal role in any organisation thay work .. <\s>
<s> People especially , the younger ones are occupied with their jobs and other trivial commitments associated with the jobs . <\s>
<s> It is clear that they donate a chunk of their time to their jobs working for the success in their careers fantasing a real comfortable life .. <\s>
<s> With the development of science and technology ( which indeed reflects in media ) , the social responsibilty towards the community is lacking . <\s>
<s> People no longer feel it is their duty to have a clean community . <\s>
<s> Let us begin at the elementary level . <\s>
<s> Keeping a street in a good condition is seen as a duty of the government organistions and all the blame goes to them for not keeping the street neat . <\s>
<s> While a deeper probe in to the issue may seem to lead to a funny situation as the citizen especially the younger ones are very irresponsible to it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The young people no longer feel that the duties towards the community are to be fulfilled rather than the rights which they demand for . <\s>
<s> So , duties should always outweigh rights . <\s>
<s> The establishment of social-service communities especially to enhance a feeiling of duty towards the communities clearly asserts the fact . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Now let us deal with the statement that Young people have enough time to help their communities . <\s>
<s> It can be described a the insensitivity of the author to look at the issue from a different facet . <\s>
<s> What does community helping mean ? <\s>
<s> It simply means having and donating time to a better , efficient and prosperous community . <\s>
<s> I believe that even though the direct approach is lacking to help and participate in the community help programmes , what the youth are doing is indeed going to improve their own community by and large . <\s>
<s> illustrating this ,, just think of as situation where the division of labour does not seem to exist . <\s>
<s> The butcher , Milkman , Vendors selling awide range of things , blacksmith , gold smith do not start doing their duty . <\s>
<s> The community would be literally in chaos and this would led to inefficient functuioning of the society . <\s>
<s> Not to forget the central fact that the order in society is basically bulit on the type of jobs the youth who comprise a substantial amount to the soceity . <\s>
<s> I do agree with the statement saying that successful people are the one who take risks with innovative things instead of what they knew already . <\s>
<s> To support my idea , I will first show that innovative things such as innovations and new technologies are factors that encourage success . <\s>
<s> Then , I will explain why people doing allways the same things may not be successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Innovation is one sector that has evoluated a lot during the last century . <\s>
<s> Men are creative , they allways try to invente new tools to help them in their daily life or to allow them to do new things . <\s>
<s> It is then easily understandable that through all the main evolutions , such as the industrial revolution , or the internet , people who wanted to take risks had very high potential of being successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Per example , the people who were confident that internet will become very important made the good bet . <\s>
<s> Today , many of them have been successful and are rich and/or famous . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , people doing the same thing continuously are less likely to be successful because they stay focused on existing sectors and activities . <\s>
<s> It is evident that if we do n't take any risks , we can not have any potential in success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As an example , we can talk about a worker in a factory . <\s>
<s> Some of them work during more than twenty years in the same position , with the same duties and salary . <\s>
<s> Usually these people are n't like this because they are less intelligent than others , but rather because they prefer to have a confortable life with no risk . <\s>
<s> But without risk , we can not change and evoluate . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , we can say that people who invest themselves in things which are related to innovation or new technology are more likely to get successful due to the potential of growth of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the other hand , people who continue doing things they know without looking in other directions and sectors will not be able to be successful . <\s>
<s> These are the key factors that make someone successful or not . <\s>
<s> Celebrated historian , Arnold Toynbee , said that for civilizations to flourish the ` creative minority ' needs to solve the problems faced by the civilization . <\s>
<s> If they are successful in doing so , the civilization continues or else it disintegrates . <\s>
<s> A problem is now being faced by our society , that of energy crisis and environmental pollution . <\s>
<s> Our enrgy resources are depleting and are environmental problems like global warming are increasing . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I firmly beleive that a solution to this problem needs to be found for our world to progress . <\s>
<s> And the solution is : lessening energy consumption where ever possible . <\s>
<s> That is why I agree with the statement : ` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . ' <\s>
<s> Countries have already set out on the path to reducing the number of cars on roads and promoting mass transit . <\s>
<s> This has a lot of benifits . <\s>
<s> Less traffic , lesser pollution , faster trasnportation , etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Day by day people are awakening to the realisation that something needs to be done about the current situation of our transportation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Legislations have also come in place in some countries , for example the extra tax that is levied on cars in Singapore almost eliminates the option of buying cars for some people and so they have to resort to means of mass transportation . <\s>
<s> In some countries you are encouraged to ` car-pool ' , which is nothing but sharing your car with your colleagues or people who have to reach the same place as you have to . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So there is definitely and trend that is emerging here , that of reducing the number of cars on roads . <\s>
<s> And as I see it almost every part of the world is working to achieve the benefits that are afforded by implementing strategies that reduce the number of cars on road and keep the people happy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> That is why I believe that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> Most people will not doubt about it , while others think quite differently on the issuse of the advertisements do n't make products seem much better . <\s>
<s> Personally , I stand on the side of the advertisement make products seem much better . <\s>
<s> There are three conspicuous concepts as follows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , this is because of the simple fact that the examples you will meet in your life . <\s>
<s> Many many times , when we see the advertisements in the TV or any where , the products in the advertisement are very perfect , excellent , so after receiving them , you are very disappointed . <\s>
<s> The real products are not like the patterns in the advertisements . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , we could cite another ordinary example of that the advertisements are also the businesses , they also want to get the money from the customers . <\s>
<s> So sometime , when they do the advertisements , they do n't worry about the quality of the products , and maybe they do n't understand the detail informations about the products , they just focus on how do the advertisements , how to make the customers to trust what they said . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , I may say that the advertiser are not the experts about the different areas . <\s>
<s> So they just need to make the advertisements look better , and let the customers believe the products , let the producer get the maximum profits , this is the rule of the market . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Certainly , some advertisements also do the good job . <\s>
<s> They just tell the truth about the products to customers . <\s>
<s> And try not to give the wrong information to public . <\s>
<s> So some people believe that most advertisements do n't make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , arguments will be against my standpoints , many people might argue that my opinions also have some drawbacks , Such as there are still some good advertisements . <\s>
<s> I might reply that most important things are multifaceted , there are many alternatives to choose from , each with uniqe advantanges and disadvantanges . <\s>
<s> I advocated my viewpoints because I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Above all this points , I support to statement because it is better to know that the advertisements are also businesses , Their main goal is also the profit , the money . <\s>
<s> So we should n't give the advertisements more belives . <\s>
<s> The world continues to explore and build modern technologies to facilitate our lives or simply to satisfy our curiosity to know more about the world and what we can benefit form it . <\s>
<s> Cars are one of these many successful inventions . <\s>
<s> Despite their usefulness and popularity , cars present environmental problems . <\s>
<s> This issue of global warming and the greenhouse effect is one that is talked about environmentalists and world leaders . <\s>
<s> Due to the efforts to tackle this problme one may expect a decrease in car usage over the next twenty years . <\s>
<s> However , I do not think that there will be fewer cars because there are no signs of decreasing vehicles in our current society . <\s>
<s> Moreover , its efficiency and luxuries it can provide outweigh the issue of global warming for anyone to consider the imediment of car usage . <\s>
<s> There are also hybrid cars which I believe will increase in number and users . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the status quo , rather than seeing a decrease in people using cars , we see more people acquiring them . <\s>
<s> The various brands of the cars continue to advertise their new luxury carriages and customers continue to appreciate cars . <\s>
<s> This has been the case for many years since cars first came into existence and unless some new , wild , completely advantageous invention is revealed to replace cars , I am inclined to believe that there will be more cars in use around the globe . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The increasing carbon dioxide emmisions and its effects on the earth has and continues to be explored . <\s>
<s> In efforts to minimise the harms caused by all the human inventions , including cars , car brands are now advertising hybrid cars which run on natural fuels that cause considerably less pollution . <\s>
<s> Such inventions prove that people love cars and cannot part with them right now when they do not see the complete significance of global warming . <\s>
<s> Hybrid cars are a solution to solve the problem of wanting to decrease carbon dioxide emissions but also to continue driving . <\s>
<s> Thus , there is no need , in the eyes of many people , to stop driving cars for any reason . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Cars continue to expand its horizons as it improves its abilities to do things . <\s>
<s> For example , car navigation systems and dvd player insertions are all new improvements to satisfy customers . <\s>
<s> The usefuleness and its easy use attracts more people to obtain their driving license and for drivers to renew their cars every so often . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , owning a car gives the owner responsibility in life , heightening their feeling of independence . <\s>
<s> In addition to this new acquired independence and property , one begins to be interested in the type , make and abilities the car possesses . <\s>
<s> To show off with the car becomes a new motive . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , with developing economy all over the world , more people are willing to spend their fortune on cars . <\s>
<s> Such arousals in emotions and considerable effects on one 's life only interest people to buy and use cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Twenty years seem almost too soon for people to stop driving cars . <\s>
<s> With developing technology and economy I can only conclude that we will continue to see as many cars in use if not more . <\s>
<s> Only a new technology like `` floo powder '' in the world of Harry Potter could possibly divert people 's attentions away from cars . <\s>
<s> We share seven million cars among six million Hong Kong people , meaning that in average one person owns 1.1 car . <\s>
<s> People become so accustomed to having cars that they will not believe it if you tell them in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> However surprising it may sound to you , many experts are in fact expecting a decrease in the number of cars in use in the future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We wo n't really need cars anymore , twenty years from now . <\s>
<s> Imagine you do n't have to go to work ; you can gain access to your company via the Internet and work at home . <\s>
<s> You do n't have to go to school ; you have all the materials and tutorial needed in your computer . <\s>
<s> You do n't need to shop at all , you can order everything by going online and clicking the mouse . <\s>
<s> Why would you need to go out ? <\s>
<s> Why would you need a car ? <\s>
<s> Simple supply and demand knowledge will reveal that if there is no longer a need for cars to substitute our legs to travel from places to places , there will be fewer cars manufactured . <\s>
<s> Things have become so convenient that cars are no longer `` convenient '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We will use up our energy resources within a century . <\s>
<s> In twenty years ' time , petroleum will become so expensive that perhaps the cost of the fuel will be higher than the car itself . <\s>
<s> By then , cars will become a most luxurious item that people can no longer afford . <\s>
<s> Less well-off families would most probably use the Mass Transit Railway or public transport instead . <\s>
<s> This can be foreseen in today 's Hong Kong ; one litre of fuel costs a fortune . <\s>
<s> One litre of fuel costs more than your monthly salary ? <\s>
<s> Ridiculous ? <\s>
<s> Sad ? <\s>
<s> But unfortunately true . <\s>
<s> More and more people are giving up cars and using the public transport . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It may seem , at the present stage , incredulous that one day we no longer need or are able to afford cars . <\s>
<s> However , the trend right now is that people are using cars less frequently and use public transport more often . <\s>
<s> It is most likely that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To my mind , the main reason for this is that today in the age of mass production there exists a graet variety of products that all want to be sold . <\s>
<s> Selling a product makes it important to draw the attention of people to it . <\s>
<s> This aim is normally achieved by using exaggerations in the advertisments of products . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , advertisements often state that a certain lotion makes look one 's skin ten years younger by taking away all wrinkels . <\s>
<s> I actually do not believe that this can be achieved just by the use of a certain lotion . <\s>
<s> A lotion might help to moisturize your skin and by this make it more soft , but I do not believe that it is able to make you look ten years younger . <\s>
<s> This is a typical exaggeration often used in an advertisement that makes the product seem to be much better than is in reality . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , people 's attention in our hectic world is usually drawn to so many things at the same time that an advertisement that just gives us clear information on a product will not help the product to be sold successfully . <\s>
<s> Most of the products advertised in TV . <\s>
<s> The cost of this type of advertisement depend on how long the product is shown . <\s>
<s> Thus time often will be rare und used in a way that draws the attention of the audience very quickly . <\s>
<s> The easiest way to do this , is to make people believe that the product is much better than all the other products that it could be compared to it . <\s>
<s> This goal is normally achieved by telling people something about the producht that makes it seem better than it is in reality . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At least , all the means of our modern media society makes products often seem better than they are in reality by proposing them in a certain light or colour . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is why I want to state that in conclusion that one should not believe everything presented in advertisements . <\s>
<s> I would agree with the statement , even though I must admit that the question if young people enjoy life more than old people do , is certainly very difficult to answer , because you have to compare people out of different times and social structures , with very different problems , options , possibilities and wishes . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let me first shortly explain the background , out of which most - if not all - older people that I know come : Most of them experienced war or the time after war ; a time full of scarcity and poverty . <\s>
<s> Everyone had to work very hard for his life . <\s>
<s> When there was money left , it was seldomly simply spent for something like holidays or having a fine dinner or theater . <\s>
<s> It was rather saved for bad times that could probably come again . <\s>
<s> They preferred - or perhaps were forced by society and expectations put on them - to go on working rather than enjoying life or doing something for themselves , just to be secure . <\s>
<s> Over the decades , life got easier of course and also those people learned to enjoy life . <\s>
<s> But I think that in most older people there is still always this feeling of first work , then enjoy their own life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , life for young people today is also certainly hard and not easy , since they have a lot of pressure to bear , implied on them from school , study or job . <\s>
<s> But I think they grew up in a society in which enjoying life is something other people make money with . <\s>
<s> Its a business - enjoying life is something like a symbol for wealth which is highly promoted in advertisement and marketing . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , it is socially accepted to enjoy life , to go on holidays , to visit bars , restaurants , cinema or to subscribe for a wellness-week . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For these reasons I think its easier and more common among young people to enjoy life than for old people . <\s>
<s> I think that the over the time period the number of cars being used today will surely decline . <\s>
<s> This is because of the increasing concerns over pollution , shrinking fossil fuel bases , availability of better ways to commute , cultural shift in dependency or association with cars and increased traffic . <\s>
<s> All these factors are now evident to anyone who uses or sees cars everyday . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Pollution has emerged to be a major concern over the period of time , and now , in comparison to older times when cars were considered to be a symbol of freedom , people have started to see them as major causes of pollution . <\s>
<s> Air pollution is done because of the usage of the common fuel , gasoline , even though we have modified the structure of gasoline to do less harm , e.g. high octane fuel , and have even equipped the cars with better technology , multiple stroke engines etc , still the safety limits are being pressed to edge , and we have experienced the damage . <\s>
<s> e.g. depletion of protective ozone layer and increased respiratory diseases among urban population . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Next , the crude oil sources used to supply fuel for cars have been continously decreasing and have reached at such an alarming low level that scientist have cautioned to start looking for alternative fuels , which are either not that efficient or are not economically as viable as gasoline . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Also , over the period of time , people have deviced better ways to commute like bullet trains , people in Japan commute almost 500KM each day to work , which was not possible with cars . <\s>
<s> Also , in other major cities alternatives means of transport such as metro rails and high capacity buses are experimented and are well recieved by people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover , these days we are moving away from the need that gave rise to this effective means of commutation such as going to work , companies are experimenting better ways like work from home options which do n't require employees to come to office , another example is reaching out to facilities such as convinient stores , now you can have everything delivered to your home on one phone call . <\s>
<s> This will eventually wash away the need of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Increased traffic and its effects like accidents are bothering people so much these days . <\s>
<s> They are more concerened about the time lost in the traffic and their safety , after all who will want an everyday commutation to office or school to become an adventure ride . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So to summarize , with the increasing awareness and decrease in the causes that lead to the use of this means of transport , coupled with environmental and health factors the car will eventually become an old means of commutation . <\s>
<s> In my life I have visited a variaty of nations . <\s>
<s> I have come to comprehend the complexity of some cultures as well as the unique characteristics each nation provides . <\s>
<s> Each cultural enviroment provides a characteristic to mandkind 's identity . <\s>
<s> The language , the food and the history every nation in the world provides is be experienced when one travels to that nation . <\s>
<s> Once we are surrounded by that culture we can explore it in a variaty of ways . <\s>
<s> Two ways are by ourselfs and by guidence of a tourguide . <\s>
<s> What I have come to realize is that a trip becomes more gratifying , as well as at the same time it provides a greater cultural aspcet of the nation , when does it with a tour guide . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although the first argument against my opioin is that with a guide we are attained to his shcedule this comes to play a small part in the desire turist have to adquire knowledge from a foreing nation . <\s>
<s> It might be true that with a group and a guide we are enshrouded in a surrounding where desicions are made by the majority . <\s>
<s> What comes to be more relevant is that although as an individual in a grup we are unable to decide where to go as an individual we do not know where to go . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In order to adquire a diverse aspect of the culture we visit we must learn what characterizes the culture . <\s>
<s> A tour guide is more than able to explain where the culture of the nation stands out for its unique characteristics . <\s>
<s> A tour guide provides as well what I personally seek in a trip , knowdlege about the nations history . <\s>
<s> By ourselfs we are able to visit far more scenarios but at the same time we are unable to grasp the meaning behind each scenario . <\s>
<s> In a trip I preffer to see few scenarios but once I come home I return with a load of cultural background conserning each scenario i visited . <\s>
<s> The pleasure each experience grants me is greater when I know the social , political , economic and historic background that the experience withholds . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some do not like the pressure a group imposes . <\s>
<s> I rather think of the shcedule in a group as the best way to handle my time in a trip . <\s>
<s> With a shcedule I regulate the time it takes me to visit each place in the culture I seek to explore . <\s>
<s> I preffer to know what I should learn from rather than wander around the city I visit . <\s>
<s> As an individual I would get of track my trip when I start to think of what I must do in order to get the most gratification out of my time in that nation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A guide provides information , a schedule and when we combine these two aspects a guide comes to provide a vast cultural knowldge I desire to discover . <\s>
<s> What a trip evokes in my mind is an unsaciable thrist of knowledge . <\s>
<s> This thrist would unlikely be calm down by my own . <\s>
<s> It is best if I have someone that is able to give me the background information of the mation I visit . <\s>
<s> By visitng a nation with a guide and a group I also learn from a new perspective . <\s>
<s> What to me might be intresting to some member of my group that same object stands out as dull . <\s>
<s> A guide and a group come to provide experiences , poins of view , cultural knowledge that when put together create a cultural diversity which comes to transalte into a remarkable trip . <\s>
<s> Being successful can be viewed as having a good life , earning more money or having a good business or academic career . <\s>
<s> In either case , it is one of the most important purpose someone have in her or his life . <\s>
<s> I strongly believe that trying and learning new things and taking risks is a way to success in any of them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Business conditions in today 's economy requires many distinct abilities . <\s>
<s> One of them is being open to learning and having a broad knowledge on many other fields . <\s>
<s> Combining the information in distinct fields is a key to succeed . <\s>
<s> A well-known example is in history of computer games and computer game industry . <\s>
<s> Two decades ago , the opponent and the other characters in games , which are controlled by the computer , were acting very strange like robotic movements and displaying no intelligence . <\s>
<s> Then , a few people realized that there are incredible amount of research in the context of human behavior in psychology . <\s>
<s> They are adapted it to their actual job which is programming games and it resulted a big success since these games provide unmatched experience . <\s>
<s> These titles have certainly been sold in millions of copies . <\s>
<s> If these people were not open to new ideas and took risk to try to use it in their job , there would be no such story . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In research or academic environments , being open to new things are not only important but is crucial . <\s>
<s> Any field of science tries to understand the nature including the universe . <\s>
<s> So , it is a vital ability to bridge the studies between different fields which are essentially trying to understand the same thing . <\s>
<s> An example is a contemporary branch of science , which is trying to understand the brain , called cognitive science . <\s>
<s> There are many fields including psychology , neuroscience , linguistics . <\s>
<s> computer science etc. involved in the brain research . <\s>
<s> If you look at the literature , the most important and influential studies is a part of two or more fields above . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , having interest on broad range of subjects , trying new things and taking risks are crucial aspects of being succeed . <\s>
<s> These are as important as other abilities you have which will put you into the one of the classes of successful people . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement for a several reasons : <\s>
<s> 1. One may not success at the first try , but eventually if one keeps trying , one will encounter success . <\s>
<s> Unsuccessful people do n't realize that success takes time and effort . <\s>
<s> They want it to be done at the first time , and that does not always happen ! <\s>
<s> There are several stories about inventors who did not give up and tried several times , even thousands of time ! <\s>
<s> The inventor of the light bulb is one that comes to my mind . <\s>
<s> Imagine what would have happened if he would have given up after all those tries ! <\s>
<s> But he kept trying and trying until he did it ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , that does n't mean to get stuck with something that does not work , which takes me to the second reason why agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> 2. I think successful people know when to change , or try a different approach . <\s>
<s> If something is not working , then know when to quit and try it in another way ! <\s>
<s> Do n't give up but do n't obsess either . <\s>
<s> Maybe take a break and look it at a different angle . <\s>
<s> Like the chemist who could not figure out the chemical composition of an element , and discovered it during a dream , when he dreamed of a snake biting its tail . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 3. Life is constantly changing , and one can not stay the same without changing . <\s>
<s> New technologies are developed on a daily basis , and you can not lock yourself in a shell and pretending change is not happening outside . <\s>
<s> Whether you like it or not , you have to try new things , or you 'll stay behind . <\s>
<s> That 's what successful people do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 4. People fear that if they take risks they will loose the few things they have now . <\s>
<s> But they fail to realize that they are having a major loss with the cost of opportunity for not using your resources and take a risk . <\s>
<s> They would gain much more if they were willing to risk what they have or their time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> 5. Also , in addition to these reasons , successful people know when to ask for help , and work in a team . <\s>
<s> One can acomplish more if one has support from other people . <\s>
<s> A young man enjoy life more than an old person . <\s>
<s> Many people are of this opinion but I disagree with this statement . <\s>
<s> It is true that young people have energy and excitment that keeps them going . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , elderly who have experienced all kinds to situations in their life time show less enthusiam . <\s>
<s> How ever this dose n't mean they do n't enjoy life . <\s>
<s> They enjoy happy moments of life as any other individual of the society . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Many elderly couple go out for vacation after they retire and they just relax in places like Florida . <\s>
<s> Many elderly go for world tour after their retirement to explore life around the world . <\s>
<s> They attain satisfaction by fulfilling their long cherished dreams . <\s>
<s> Many a time aged also pamper themselves with the favorite articles of use like jwellary , gadgets etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If one is gets involved in activities he loves to do he would surely derive happiness Aged very often indulge full time in their hobby and work they love to do . <\s>
<s> After the age of 60 they want to do anything and every thing that they have not not done but wanted to do while they were working to make their ends meet . <\s>
<s> For example , some who are humanitarian may start volunteering fot Non profits and gain pleasure by helping others in need , whereas some other may prefer to engage him self in creative hobbies like pottery , gardening , music etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is said that old people are like kids . <\s>
<s> Old people love to play with their grand children . <\s>
<s> They derive fun and excitement in playing , hopping around with kids , telling them stories etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up I would say that most of times old people are independent of any responsibility thus they have enough time to relax , chill and seek joy in things that makes them happy . <\s>
<s> They have have the sense of accomplishment and fulfillment which enables them to live life freelly as they want . <\s>
<s> According to me having a broad knowledge is important at the biginning stages of your knowledge building . <\s>
<s> It serves as the base or foundation for your knowledge . <\s>
<s> For me having the ability to contribute in every possible field in acadamic subjects is the great thing . <\s>
<s> The main reason for this is my excitement and quick grasping power which attracts me to the every new and different thing around me . <\s>
<s> I prefer to have every possible knowledge of all the subjects . <\s>
<s> This developes interest and also helps to experience more number of fields rather than many things in same field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By having broad knowledge of many subjects makes average level of knowledge very high . <\s>
<s> but by speciallising in one subjects restricts the growth of knowledge in other subjects and also it has a specific limit . <\s>
<s> What after that limit ? , when you know everything in the same subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For me its important to know more about many things than knowing everything about one thing . <\s>
<s> For example in any industry , the main work consists of many small works such as machine handling , actually working on that machine , its maimtainance , repairing ant many things like this in many regions . <\s>
<s> Here its not possible to solve every problem by only one specialist . <\s>
<s> Because he has the knowledge about one thing only . <\s>
<s> So he cant help for the other problems . <\s>
<s> Here the role of generlist is important . <\s>
<s> He has answers for many things and in many fields . <\s>
<s> we can say manager . <\s>
<s> Manager is called so because he can manage all things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So i prefer to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects and thats why the are being introduced , thats why they are being teached . <\s>
<s> Otherwise people will have one subject only . <\s>
<s> which cannot work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In todays world you cant live with knowledge of only one field . <\s>
<s> More the knowledge more you can grow . <\s>
<s> For me being a jack of everything is the best way to grow in knowledge . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> My conviction is based on three reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , the low birthrate in many countries will cause a sharp reduction in the number of future drivers . <\s>
<s> It is a well-established fact that the largest number of drivers are found in developed countries in North America , Europe and Japan . <\s>
<s> It is also clear that birthrate has been dropping during the past decades in these regions . <\s>
<s> With the reduction of population , there will certainly be a reduction in the number of drivers and cars . <\s>
<s> It can be argued that China is a rising market for cars . <\s>
<s> However , I do not believe that the growth in Chinese market will make up for the loss in other places . <\s>
<s> Besides , the largest number of cars are found in the east coast big cities , where the streets are already jammed with cars and cannot make room to hold more . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the gas shortage will help to reduce the number of cars . <\s>
<s> The energy crisis that we are facing today will also be faced by the next generation . <\s>
<s> Due to the limited energy supply on this planet , people in the future years will define gas shortage as a more serious problem than we do . <\s>
<s> Considering the difficulty of discovering an alternative energy to replace gas , I am convinced that change of numbers of car will be pretty obvious in the near future . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Third , the reduction of number of cars is and will continue to be fueled by people 's rising concern of the environmental issues . <\s>
<s> Over the past decades , people have come to realize that the substances emitted by vehicles will cause an unrevocable damage to our environment . <\s>
<s> With the progress made in our understanding to the earth , it will become even clearer that cars using the currently available fuels will have a long-term , negative effects on the atmosphere and our health . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In summary , I have full confidence that , due to the low birthrate , gas shortage and people 's environmental awareness , there will be fewer cars in the twenty years to come . <\s>
<s> I definitely think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , rather then specialising in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Firstly , in my opi it is necessary to have a broad view on a variety of subjects in order to understand our increasingly complex world . <\s>
<s> Secondly , innovation , whether in the fields of science , business or politics , is often lead by people who have a cross-funtional view . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , the primary purpose of education is to prepare students to face the world with the right skills and knowledge . <\s>
<s> The world we live in , it turns out , is increasingly complex . <\s>
<s> In order to succeed in this world , it is necessary to have a broad understanding of several subjects . <\s>
<s> For example , an engineer can not rely only on its engineering skills but should also communicate on what he is doing , as most of the great technical achievements of our times rely on a team rather then a single person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Then , a lot of innovations result from applying a principle or idea taken from one field and applying it to another , which can only be achieved by people who have a broad understanding of several fields . <\s>
<s> The post-it is a good illustration . <\s>
<s> It has become a popular and useful item in offices but it actually results from the invention of a glue that did not fix well enough to be used in a traditional way ! <\s>
<s> Another striking example is the bridge that was created between computer science and biology in the invention of neuronal programming . <\s>
<s> Neuronal programming simulates the mechanisms of the nervous cells of the brain , enabling the programme to learn . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion , I think that students benefit from having a broad knowledge of several subjects , because it helps them to tackle with the challenges of our modern world , whether as leaders or as innovators . <\s>
<s> Of course , this should not prevent them from acquiring more extensive knowledge in a specific field . <\s>
<s> I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> I agree to this because young people nowdays have more work than what they used to have in the past . <\s>
<s> There are more responsibilities for the young people nowadays though helping communities is one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Modernisation is one factor which is responsible for the gradual change in the attitude of the people . <\s>
<s> There are so many technological developements that people can evade their responsiblties from their daily work . <\s>
<s> Young people are more aware of these technolgies through their educational system . <\s>
<s> Young people make the maximum use of these technologies to evade responsibilities . <\s>
<s> For example young people need not take advice from people of their community anymore as they consider that all the information is already available which they can have it by themselves . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another factor for young people not helping their communities is the work load which is given to them . <\s>
<s> Universities and Colleges give the students so much work that they have to spend all their free time in completing the work . <\s>
<s> Many families can be pointed out where the youngsters work to support their families . <\s>
<s> Some youngsters have to also take care of their siblings in some families . <\s>
<s> With all this responsibilities which have to be given proir importance how can the youngsters worry about not helping their communities . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , the modern day parents are slowly losing time to teach their kids important things . <\s>
<s> Many families are there where both the mother and father are working . <\s>
<s> So while working how can the parents teach their kids the necassary values which are very much needed in the society . <\s>
<s> We can say that schools do teach students the values but can these values be taught individually like how the parents teach . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude there are many responsibilities for the younger people to take care of . <\s>
<s> It is necassary for the adults and senior citizen to help them realise their resposibilities amid all the development . <\s>
<s> I think that we all need to have a minimum knowledge of many academic subjects but we have to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> During the childhood , we all studied mathematics but also skills on language or history . <\s>
<s> And we all agree that it is essential for everybody to know some things on many academic subjects , because it is usefull all day long . <\s>
<s> You use mathematics when you are going out shopping , you have to know a bite of history if you want to understand what is happening on the political news , and you must know how to read in today world . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But if you want to succeed in your work , you have to be the best or at least one of the best in the subject that you are dealing with . <\s>
<s> Because today 's world is done of concurrence and nobody will help you if you do not succeed . <\s>
<s> So you have to train a lot and become the best in what you want to deal with in your life . <\s>
<s> Look at a sportif . <\s>
<s> Is Tiger Woods practicing other sports than golf ? <\s>
<s> Maybe sometimes but he is really focused on golf and he is really specialized on his subject . <\s>
<s> If he had done during his childhood many differents sports he may not be the world number one at golf today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But culture is also essential and culture is about everything . <\s>
<s> The definition in french of a ` gentilhomme ' is somebody who knows many things on many subjects and who does not have a passion . <\s>
<s> If someone can speaks on many different subjects it will be someone looked like an intelligent guy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus if you want to succeed in your social life you must have broad knoledge of many academic subjects but if you want to succeed in your work and earn a lot of money you then must to specialize in one specific subject and become the best on that subject <\s>
<s> I believe that it is not necessary that successful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For me , success is an absolute term . <\s>
<s> It cannot be defined by some standards like having money or a high position in job . <\s>
<s> Success is what you feel it is . <\s>
<s> For some people success may be to lead a peaceful life with family and friends while sharing whatever you have . <\s>
<s> So in that terms a person may be successful by just doing whatever he knows to do well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , those who try new things and take risks may not be successful . <\s>
<s> Taking risks has both pros and cons . <\s>
<s> One may achieve a lot and at the same time there is a possibility that he may lose everything he has , while a person who does whatever he knows well is sure to keep doing that part and be content . <\s>
<s> In taking risks and trying new things , until you succeed you have the fear of losing . <\s>
<s> You put not only your happiness and well being at stake , but also of those who are dependent on you for their happiness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A person trying to do new things has to devote a lot of time researching the options , finding the best opportunity or creating one and then working on it . <\s>
<s> If he devotes the same time in doing what he already knows , he can spare some time for pleasure and fun . <\s>
<s> There are no statistics to prove that conservatives ( who do not take risks ) are less successful as compared to aggresives ( who take risks ) . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Risk averse and risk tolerant attitudes are also reflective of a culture or background . <\s>
<s> Again , there are no reports that show that people who took risks and tried new things were the only ones to succeed . <\s>
<s> e.g. Mother Teresa is a successful personality . <\s>
<s> She did social work which she new well and kept doing it till the end of her life . <\s>
<s> Similarly there are examples of people who gamble with the view of taking risk and trying to be successful , but lose everything . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I would say that if for me success is to be happy and satisfied in life and I am happy and satisfied while doing whatever I know to do well , then I am a successful person . <\s>
<s> i am not in complete congruence with the statement , i believe that in some cases it is more important to understand concepts and ideas rather than to learn facts . <\s>
<s> because the feild of education is a vastly diverse and thus u need to bend yourself as per the reqiurements of the subject i opine that in sciences we need to understand the concepts grasp the ideas and also apply them as per the situations , science require you to not only memorise the facts buts also wants you to apply the logical conclusions of the facts or concepts learnt , so as to arrive at a best solution to a problem . <\s>
<s> for instance in subjects such as mathematics you need to apply the concepts that you have learnt and bring out a solution for the problem , not only does maths requires this buts also , various sciences related to maths such as computer science which require you to frame programes depending on the the customers problem . <\s>
<s> if the scientist in olden dyas were only memorizing the facts but not understanding them then the people living in this modern era would be deprived of the knowledge of gravity , electricity and many more essential concepts . <\s>
<s> thus we need to uderstand the ideas and apply them as per the situatuion memorizing facts on the other hand is useful when we study arts and subjects like history , geology and also the other sciences such as biology and zoology , for evidence in olden days people use to caliculate which part of the day is it by looking at the sun 's position , thus to caliculate this we need the knowlegede fo from which side thus the sun rise , since sun rise in the east , people remember this fact and make conclusions about the part of the day . <\s>
<s> thus memoization fo facts helps you while innovating a new concept that we nwwd to remember the characterist feature of the thing or object in order to derive a conclusion i would also like to bring otu a point that there is alwasys a case of forgetting things while your are memorizing facts , but there is no case of forgettin concepts or ideas once you memorize them . <\s>

<s> I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> This is because the current society seems to promote active community services in many areas and encourage young people to get involved in community services by suggesting attractive rewards by doing that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To start with , most schools requires certain tasks of community services in school activities . <\s>
<s> I personally experienced this when I was in highschool in Sydney . <\s>
<s> I and my friends are regulary sent to certain institutions or places that need help . <\s>
<s> Thus we had to spend two hours a week in evey year helping our communities . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , it is now became compulsory for all students to spend certain amount of time helping communities in order to graduate middle school and high school in Korea . <\s>
<s> Therefore , it can be said that young people spend enough time to helping their communities whethere they want or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , community services do help young people enter a college or get a job . <\s>
<s> Most colleges and companies gives extra scores if a candidate have numerous experience of community services . <\s>
<s> In other words , more and more young people desire to help their communities in order to enter colleges or get a job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In short , I strongly believe that young people spend enough time to helping communities in these days . <\s>
<s> In fact , it seems that the society force young people to participate in community services more rather than vonluteer themselves . <\s>
<s> But this phenomenon cannot be blamed because young people nowadays seems that they becomes more selfish than ever before . <\s>
<s> Therefore , in which way they contribute to helping communities , it is true that young people spend enough time to help thei <\s>
<s> Is it better to know a little bit about everyting or everything about one topic ? <\s>
<s> This is a question that every student faces during his academic career . <\s>
<s> But no teacher will ever answer it for you . <\s>
<s> In order to find an answer , there are many different levels that must be considered . <\s>
<s> It will be usefull to look at the effects on the academic life , personal life and personal relationships . <\s>
<s> Personally I believe that a broad knowledge is much better for most people . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For your private life and personal developement a broad knowledge is more valuable than spezialized knowledge . <\s>
<s> A broad knowledge helps you to handle all kinds of different situations . <\s>
<s> You always have an idea what kind of solution may resolve the problem . <\s>
<s> For example if you have some knowledge about law , you can resolve many problems by yourself without an expensive lawyer . <\s>
<s> You could also help your friend who would be very gratefull . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Considering personal relationships a broad knowledge normally is more important . <\s>
<s> Broadly educated people are able to communicate with everyone about everything without getting embarassed . <\s>
<s> In contrast , people with very specialized knowledge are likely to get a little lonely . <\s>
<s> They often talk to people with a similar knwoledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If someone wants to become an scientist and do some research , specialized knowledge is much more usefull than general knowledge . <\s>
<s> These days there is a specialist for everything and it 's not easy to find a topic to do research on . <\s>
<s> You have to know almost everything about your topic . <\s>
<s> So it 's very hard to get a board knowledge besides . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I think a broad knowledge is much better , unless you want to become a scientis . <\s>
<s> Broadly educated people perfom better in their private live and are more sociable . <\s>
<s> They easier communicate with other people about all kinds of topic . <\s>
<s> But this is a choice that everyone has to make for himself depending on his plans . <\s>
<s> From my point of view , in general I can only agree with this statement . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless I think this statement requests for further analysis in detail to come to a final opinion on that topic . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is a clear and from my pespective very sad trend that young people nowadays do not invest much of their spare time into helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Therefore it is important to evaluate the reasons for this trend first . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Being 21 years old myself and therefore belonging to the group of `` young people '' I think I can base my evaluation on my own experiences . <\s>
<s> One of the main problems communities have to face is to make `` helping the community '' attractive for young people , especially taking the diversity of other possible activities young people are offered today into consideration . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most young people rather invest their time into entertainment than in helping their communities neglecting the fact that helping their community can become entertainment , too . <\s>
<s> I experienced a good example of this myself . <\s>
<s> Since I starting thinking I know about a little festival in our suburb of the city of Cologne . <\s>
<s> Everybody knew about the existance of this little festival , but somehow nobody was interested in the organization or marketing of the festival . <\s>
<s> No wonder such conditions led to dramatically decreasing numbers of visitors throughout the years , which made the festival itself of no interest at all for the young population in our suburb because it always had the prestige of being `` boring '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But one day our school principal started a school-wide project called `` Organize a social party '' . <\s>
<s> Initiated by a good friend , some friends of mine and me started to think about an event we could use to organize . <\s>
<s> Then it came to our minds , that it would not be neccessary to invent a new social event at all . <\s>
<s> All we had to do was to do a better organization and better marketing campaign for the existing suburb festival . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Soon we started brainstorming for ideas that could make this community festival more interesting and attractive for young people . <\s>
<s> Quickly a whole bunch of ideas was collected , so for example , a soccer competion called `` Little World Cup '' where little teams of young players represented a country of the world fighting for the world championship . <\s>
<s> Soon everyone in school was talking about this competition and the community festival , too . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The result was an all-time record of festival visitors that year . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This little personal example shows up how `` helping their community '' can become entertainment and therefore become much more attractive for young people . <\s>
<s> All that it necessary is to show up the attractiveness of improving their community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If this can be aim can be achieved I think much more young people will start thinking about becoming active in their community . <\s>
<s> And this , even this may not be the way out of the dilemma at all , it is a important first step to deal with this trend among the young generation . <\s>
<s> Yes , it is correct to say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning them . <\s>
<s> If a student learns a fact or a text then it wo n't last longer in his mind whereas if a student understand a fact through examples and reasons then the fact would last longer in his mind because things done practically has a greater impact then things done theoritically . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , if a chemistry book a procedure for making a soap is given then a student learn how to make a soap efficiently . <\s>
<s> He would rather come to know the procedure to make a soap if he learns the process . <\s>
<s> But on oter hand if a student make a soap practically then he would not need to learn the procedure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Its just the understanding power of a person which works throughout his life , not the learning power . <\s>
<s> Lets take an another example : if a student is being prepared for the interview for getting a scholarship and the teachers are preparing him for the interview by simply giving him the list of questions , which is expected to be asked from the student , with answers and the student memorises the answers to each and every question . <\s>
<s> Incase the student selection commitee for the scholarship asks the student a question which is out of that list or may be from the list but with the different text , then a student wo n't be able to answer the question . <\s>
<s> Whereas , if the student had undestood the questions and the manner how to answer the question then it would n't had create any problem for this student to answer . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Student life is the base of the whole life and if we are misguided at this point of life then it would surely create problems in future . <\s>
<s> Learning a concept wo n't help a student to perform better . <\s>
<s> If we take Maths as subject then the student with the habit of learning wo n't be able to crack the questions in maths as the subject needs the understanding power of the student to understand the concept . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore in my opinion , a student should always understand the concepts rather than learning them . <\s>
<s> Old temples , beautiful Japanese trees , and traditional Japanese snacks and food . <\s>
<s> Kyoto is one of my favorite places to travel . <\s>
<s> On the contrary , Tokyo is where modern lives of Japanese people can be observed . <\s>
<s> High buildings , crowded streets , and fetid smells of smogs . <\s>
<s> But what if you do not know anything about Japan and would like to travel ? <\s>
<s> Would you rather buy a tour package led by a tour guide ? <\s>
<s> The best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide because of lack of personal preparetion , flexibility , and personal experience . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The first reason that a tour guided by a guide is not recommended is that people tend not to prepare by themselves . <\s>
<s> It is true that a guide knows the places the tourists will go and prepare plans for them . <\s>
<s> However , it is very uninteresting for tourists to go places without personal preparation . <\s>
<s> For example , if you are interested in Japanese history and go to Kyoto , it will be a great pleasure . <\s>
<s> Rather than the guide telling you what happened in Horyu-temple and why Kinkaku-temple was constructed , if you learned by yourself and are interested in , it will be more great excitement to go there . <\s>
<s> In addition , lots of information are easily available online or in books , you do not have to get a tour guide to travel around . <\s>
<s> Thus , you can prepare by yourselves to fit to your own interests and excitement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second drawback of a tour guided by a guide is lack of flexibility . <\s>
<s> The plan is so rigid that you do not have freedom to spend your time as much as you wish . <\s>
<s> The guide shouts , `` Get off the bus at 2:15 pm , and come back at 3:15 pm . <\s>
<s> Be sharp ; otherwise , other people will be annoyed . '' <\s>
<s> How does it sound ? <\s>
<s> On the other hand , if you find a place is so boring and have to stay for three hours because of the schedule of the tour , how do you feel ? <\s>
<s> In addition , the plan of the tour does n't necessarily reflect your interest . <\s>
<s> Mostly , the plan by a guide is so generalized that the places you will go are more likely famous places . <\s>
<s> For example , I went to France primarily to see the iron chuck which is the standard of measurement because I am interested . <\s>
<s> Is there any tour like that ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , the first and second disadvantages of a tour led by a guide strongly relate to lack of personal experience . <\s>
<s> If you prepare by yourself and go to the places to learn something more , the journey will be very brilliant . <\s>
<s> If you have a travel desined by your own tastes and favorites , the journey might be difficult but be unique . <\s>
<s> If you find the place uninteresting and dull , you can change your plan . <\s>
<s> If you find a better restauraunt to eat , you can just hop into the restaurant . <\s>
<s> All these experiences will be so precious , personal , and luminious . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide due to lack of personal preparation , flexibility , and personal experience . <\s>
<s> Yes , travel with a guide might be safer and knowledgble , but getting personalized and unique experience in travelling is the most important . <\s>
<s> As an Italian citizen working and living within an American environment , after reading your question whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts , the first thing that came to my mind was the difference in the teaching and learning principles that I could identify between the Italian and the American systems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Until recently , the Italian education system has been focused and built on the importance of theory on practice , to the point of delivering highly educated graduate students that due to the poor or complete lack of practice , experienced a very tough time once out in the work market , trying to get a job . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , what I have seen of the U.S. education system tells me that it is centered more on letting the students learn from facts than from theory . <\s>
<s> Personal experience : my husband is a computer network engineer and I recall his first computer network college book including several chapters explaining the mathematical and physical principles related to issues like band-width and associated data transmission speed . <\s>
<s> Well , knowning that unfortunately my husband has a very poor math and physics background , I asked him how come he ended up getting an A to that class and his answer was really astonishing for me Italian student , used to the Italian education system . <\s>
<s> Basically , my husband told me that their teacher simply told them to skip all the math/physics chapters , because they really did n't need to know why things happened in a certain way , but just the way they worked . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hopefully , I am sure that not all U.S. college teachers are like the one above that was teaching computer networks to my husband and most likely his case represents just an extreme . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless , I do deem that a little more attention to theory may benefit the U.S. education system , just like more practice would benefit the Italian one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Basically , in my opinion , `` understanding ideas and concepts '' and `` learning facts '' should be considered as factors equally important to students . <\s>
<s> Actually , to me the ideal education system should contemplate an equal distribution of either learning systems . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , to me the appropriately educated person is the one that knows not only how things happen ( learning facts ) , but also why the world runs the way it does ( understanding ideas and concepts ) . <\s>
<s> In 2006 we are living in the world of mass media . <\s>
<s> I think it is not possible to escape from this situation . <\s>
<s> Advertisements are directs products of this phenomenon , surely one of the most important and profitable parts . <\s>
<s> Today advertisements are not only used to sell products or promoting business but even to advertise politicians during the elections . <\s>
<s> It gives us an idea of how big their effects could be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertise to sell products is essential . <\s>
<s> Many time we buy completely unuseful things only because they appear in the television . <\s>
<s> The majority of people considers , probably not conscionsly , a good product what they have seen advertised , indipendently from quality . <\s>
<s> It has happened also to me several times . <\s>
<s> Advertisement tends to make products better than they are . <\s>
<s> Some days ago , for example , I bought a very expensive profume only because it was advertised by my favorite actor , without taste it before . <\s>
<s> At the end i have discovered it was smelling very bed . <\s>
<s> I can add severel other examples . <\s>
<s> A special case can be food . <\s>
<s> Food in television appears very coloured and looks very tasty , of course much nicer that the one cultivated by my grandparents in my house , but often the quality is really low . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Usually big companies have the power to advertise their products massively . <\s>
<s> It is vital for their image and , above all , for their profits . <\s>
<s> Let the products know can be better than produce well . <\s>
<s> It makes money . <\s>
<s> To summarize , I think that advertisement has a big impact on the image of products , despite their quality . <\s>
<s> Consequentelly it depends on final customers be aware of this potential problem . <\s>
<s> It is impossible nowaday not to be influenced by the advertisements , but I whis people will be more quality oriented in the future . <\s>
<s> Despite the fact that each people has his own way of learning and understanding , in a general point view , I think that best results can be obtained by focusing on ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> That does not mean , however , that facts should never be dealt with . <\s>
<s> The best way is certainly finding a compromise between the two approaches . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ideas and concepts are , to my opinion , the most important part of learning , like the foundations of a building which is growing bigger and bigger . <\s>
<s> Theory is the first brick you can build on . <\s>
<s> Moreover , ideas and concepts tend to be universal - I think a good theory is evaluated to its degree of universalism . <\s>
<s> In a way , we could say that theory precedes the facts in that it aims at explain , and sometimes predict them . <\s>
<s> Therefore learning and understanding ideas and concepts is important because it permits to think from a general point of view , without being tied by circumstancial conditions for instance . <\s>
<s> It gives students ability to adapt to a broad range of situations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , I think it is not possible to only rely on theory . <\s>
<s> Facts must be used to endorse - or refute - theories and , to my mind , theory alone is worth nothing : everyone can build theories but we should be only interested in ones that have direct links to observable facts , ones that use those facts to give more credibility to the general statements they posit . <\s>
<s> Facts are essential in testing theories since they represents what has actually happened which give them strong credibility and thus they are key elements of a theory 's validation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conlusion I would say that both are importants - ideas and concepts on one hand and facts on the other hands - because they are part of a general process , they do not exclude each other and one without the other is worth nothing . <\s>
<s> However , I think there could be a chronological aspect : it would probably be more effecient to work on ideas and concepts before dealing with facts . <\s>
<s> The topic herein holds great importance as it has to deal with the youth , future mentors of any society . <\s>
<s> I believe that the young people these days are not giving enough time to develop and upbring their communities . <\s>
<s> The young generation has become much more careless towards their communities as they are already so occupied with several other things which are of more importance to them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , the increasing competition to earn a better living has taken away all their extra time that they would have devoted in heping their communities . <\s>
<s> These young people are focussing these days on the need of earning a better living , better education , better standing in the society and all the other related things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , with the increasing property rates , food costs and prices of other daily living needs , these people have become more money minded . <\s>
<s> Hence , instead of giving free time for the upliftment of their communities , they can devote that time either to earn some extra bucks or to enjoy life with what they already have . <\s>
<s> The time given for community may not yield any instant benefit to them , hence , the time is spent in an activity which will give them immediate results . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , in the upliftment of their community , they may also have to spend some money alongwith time , which makes them bit more reluctant to indulge in any such activity . <\s>
<s> These days , such activities can be related to charity and if someone has lot of money , the area of donations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , I feel that the young generation nowadays are trying to adapt to the new economic situation which has a lot of significance for leading their future life and creating a good environment for the future generation . <\s>
<s> They are a part of the changing world which has changed a lot over a period of time and is changing constantly with a faster pace . <\s>
<s> Hence , all their time is taken away by the activities with which they survive in this changing socio-economic world . <\s>
<s> Why , you may wonder , should we purchase items according to advertisements ? <\s>
<s> When facing this decision whether or not to believe an advertisement , somebody will claims that they trust these things , but others , in constrast , will believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than their practical situations . <\s>
<s> From my point of view , I 'd like to choose the second one and my arguments are listed as follows . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , an important reason why I hold confidence on this view is that the advertisements always states how well their products are . <\s>
<s> They may claim that they company has a strong background and what they produce may have some perfect effects . <\s>
<s> However can you believe that there is something perfert in the world ? <\s>
<s> Usually , their words are not true . <\s>
<s> For example , there is a famous company , Odian Company in China , which is focusing on the production of modern floors . <\s>
<s> In its advertisement , It claims that its commander center is located in Germany , but this have been disapproved by a newpaper . <\s>
<s> Therefore , how can we believe the advertisement like that ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , another reason for my inclination for my view is that we can not find the beautiful characteritics stated in advertisements . <\s>
<s> That is to say ; when we buy one item and begin to use it , we may find that these `` splendid '' characteristics disappers and some new problems arise . <\s>
<s> From a practical point of view , the advertisements will always blow up in order to make money . <\s>
<s> For instance , one of my classmates has ever brought an air condition . <\s>
<s> According the statement of the advertisement , it will not produce much noice . <\s>
<s> However , his practical experience proved that it is not easy to fall sleeping if this machine is turned on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Of course , an advertisement can tell us something useful . <\s>
<s> For a new product , a good advertisement can help the customers to learn some detailed things about it and spread its impacts in the society . <\s>
<s> Specially , to some extent , I 'll agree that the statements in a couple of advertisement may be consistent with the real features . <\s>
<s> However , if all the aspects are contemplated , it seems advisable for us to believe that most advertisements will blow up . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In a word , although advertisements can supply some useful information , most of them are blowing up in order to make profits . <\s>
<s> What they claim just try to tell something unture to make their products more attactive . <\s>
<s> From all the above arguments , we can reach the conclusion , that most advertisement will blow up in their introduction . <\s>
<s> I strongly disagree with the statement made and believe that the number of cars would certainly increase in the coming twenty years . <\s>
<s> The reasons and examples for my stand are included herewith . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Firstly , let me consider the ten year back scenario , when having or possessing a car was considered to be a big asset and people used to consider it as a property which distinguishes the people owning cars and the ones who do not . <\s>
<s> To exemplify , I bring into picture my own experience , five years back , when i was going to the school , i used to feel that some of my friend 's parents who had cars were on a higher economic scale than our family . <\s>
<s> But two years back my father who is a scientist bought a luxury car , even though he was not given any promotions in his job . <\s>
<s> The answer that my father gave when i asked him regarding this was simply a straight one . <\s>
<s> My father told me that the rates of the cars had come down rapidly and everyone of our caliber can afford a car . <\s>
<s> I was amused to hear this , because of the fact that just in three years , the whole scenario has changed . <\s>
<s> Not only my father but a lot of people started buying the luxury cars because of their availability and reduction in cost . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The advances in technology that are being made support my point . <\s>
<s> The latest technical advances that we have today in automobile industry has drastically reduced the costs of the cars and even made them more attractive . <\s>
<s> The growth of competition between the leading car manufacturers like toyota , maruti , suzuki etc. also solidifies my point . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Statistics show that , in some of the cities in India , for example Hyderabad , Chennai and Delhi , the sales of latest cars have increased by 25 % from the year 2004 to 2006 . <\s>
<s> The percentage increase in the number of cars all over the country ( India ) was about 15 % from the year 2002 to 2005 ( The statistics are from the best of my knowledge ) . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The only problem that comes into our minds is the availability of power , which comes in form of Diesel or Petrol . <\s>
<s> Because of the unavailability of oil , the costs of petrol and diesel have gone up drastically during the past few years in India and this might even hinder the people from buying automobiles but many Research and Development divisions of automobile industry all over the world are concentrating on this issue and they are trying to find alternative means in order to make the cars run , like the use of CNG cylinders , which has been now commertialised in New Delhi and slowly is shifting towards the southern part of the country . <\s>
<s> Researches are also trying to find means by which cars can run on water , a recent team of 12 students from IIT-Delhi and DCE located in Delhi have come up with an idea where a car runs at 30kmph using water . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People use cars basically for a faster mean of transportation and also to assure themselves of a comfortable journey . <\s>
<s> Most of the teenagers are also nowadays starting to learn how to ride a car , so that they can participate in driving whenever parents feel tired and this even helps them in developing new skills . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Hence with the advent of technological advancements it can be said that the number of cars would continue to increase and provide people with a cheaper , faster , comfortable and an easier way of transportation . <\s>
<s> I certainly agree with the following statement , `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' <\s>
<s> How can a person be successful if he does n't take risks and try finding out new things in life . <\s>
<s> If a person does n't experence it , how would they know if they are good at other things and not just at one thing . <\s>
<s> If you experince different things in life you also would experience at the same time different emotions . <\s>
<s> Emotions are what a person expresses and feels . <\s>
<s> While expereincing you may find out what 's right and what 's wrong . <\s>
<s> A successful person , in my opinion , learns form their mistakes , how would you learn from your mistakes if you only repeat what your good at . <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things inorder for them to learn from their mistakes . <\s>
<s> To live successful , you have to be successful . <\s>
<s> For exmaple my mother is a successful bussiness women , she became successful after going through many different stiutations . <\s>
<s> Some situations she faced were harsh and others were pleasing . <\s>
<s> You find out your successfulness after experincing different issues and going through different emotions . <\s>
<s> You never know when your successful until the end . <\s>
<s> Taking risk , is all about being successful . <\s>
<s> Risking your life and taking risks are one factor that helps build up your personality . <\s>
<s> It makes your personality stronger and tougher . <\s>
<s> Personality is what makes you unique and different from others . <\s>
<s> If your a successful person , your personality supposed to be great and optimistic , looking at things in a postive side of view , even if you face a difficult siutation that you thought your not going to face . <\s>
<s> Poeple build up thier personality by experincing different emotion . <\s>
<s> There has been many controversies going on regarding whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> I strongly believe that a person should have broad knowledge of various academic subjects rather than specialized knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , having broad knowledge allows an individual to become `` better '' than a person who specialized in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> What I mean by better is that the person will have more opportunity to get a good job and have a better life , because after all , what a company and the society look for in a person is how round an individual is . <\s>
<s> The broader a person 's knowledge is , the more an individual is considered rounded . <\s>
<s> For example , my father who is a CEO of his own company once said that a company looks for a person who is rounded rather than a perosn who is good in one specific area . <\s>
<s> When he chooses new workers for his company , he always sees if a person has broad knowledge or not . <\s>
<s> His rationale behind this is that if a person is more rounded , then the individual will be able to work in many different areas , which brings up the efficiency of the company as a whole . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Not only that , but a rounded person is usually more experienced with various things . <\s>
<s> Rounded person has vast knowledge which reflects that the individual must have had experienced many aspects of life . <\s>
<s> However , if a person is specialized in one detailed subject , then it reflects that a person has narrow mind and is less experienced than the rounded person is . <\s>
<s> For example , a friend of mine who has broad knowledge is more familiar with all the different kinds of events happening . <\s>
<s> However , another friend of mine who is specialized in one speicific subject is narrow minded and unfamiliar with subjects that he did not specialize . <\s>
<s> Thus , the extent of the knowledge portray 's a person 's experience in life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , a person who has broad knowledge is more opened minded than the specialized person is . <\s>
<s> A good example is my mother who has endless knowledge about everything . <\s>
<s> Everytime I talk to her , I realize that she is very liberal and is open minded . <\s>
<s> However , my father who specialized in Chinese culture in University , has a very conservative and closed mind about all the events because he simply does not have broad experiences . <\s>
<s> I personally think being opened and liberal is crucial in current society , because the new generations of people are generally welcoming changes and are opened as well , and in these days it is important to fit in the society in order to survive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To summarize , I advocate the point that a person should have broad knowledge of many different academic subjects . <\s>
<s> A Korean proverb states `` Digging one well is hard , but digging many different well with same depth as that of digging one well is harder , '' which means , an individual should challenge oneself by digging various wells , also meaning that a person should have broadd knowledge of many different subjects . <\s>
<s> The issue of trying new things and taking risks to get success is controversial . <\s>
<s> While some people think that success can comes if they keep on doing what they are used to do , others assume that they have to deal with completely new and risky issues . <\s>
<s> According to me , the latter viewpoint is the most appropriate way to reach success . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact I have the feeling that one has to discover some new opportunities to be on the front scene . <\s>
<s> One instance of this is the big computer compamy apple which launched the `` i-pod product '' a few years ago . <\s>
<s> In fact this device was different from its competitor products . <\s>
<s> Even the apple project was risky , the consumers adopted it and the sales successfully increased . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , success can not be met if one does not take risk . <\s>
<s> For example , in financial services company , success means important money gains which is not possible if a minimun risk is not taken . <\s>
<s> Indeed , warrants provide more hopeful gains than options do but are seven times risky . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , being successful means being the best of all competitors . <\s>
<s> One example is the formula one team that has the goal to win the world car championship . <\s>
<s> Each year , is has to compete with other car brands and try new technologies such as new bumpers to improve the aerodynamic profile of the vehicle , and to invest a lot of money for which it is not sure to get a profit in return . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion , for getting success people need to try new opportunities and to take risks that can drive them to the top level situation they have ever dreamt . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement of succussful people taking risks . <\s>
<s> I believe that not changing approaches from old ways is not always the best thing . <\s>
<s> It causes people not to open up their minds to new things , which leads to slower progression . <\s>
<s> One needs to try new things so that he or she could `` evovle '' to become better . <\s>
<s> Examples of individuals took in new things are Shingo Suetsugu and Ichiro Suzuki . <\s>
<s> Suetsugu became the first Japanese to medal in the sprinting at the world competition . <\s>
<s> He was able to do so beacuse he took a different approach to running . <\s>
<s> Another person is Ichiro Suzuki . <\s>
<s> Ichiro is one of the greatest baseball in the history . <\s>
<s> His approach to baseball has been very much different from the others . <\s>
<s> His batting style is very distinct , which shows his acceptance of new things . <\s>
<s> It was great for them for taking in new approach for running , otherwise they might not have been successful . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Shingo Suetsugu became a world class sprinter after he took a different approach than in the past . <\s>
<s> At first , this new style of running did not show much improvements . <\s>
<s> Normally , people would doubt this new way because they do not see any benefit , but Suetsugu did not do that , he kept going with the new way . <\s>
<s> Through trainings with the new method and modifying it , his times slowly but surely started to improve . <\s>
<s> As a result , he was able to compete at a world class level and get the bronze medal . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another individual of a successful person is also an athlete , Ichiro Suzuki . <\s>
<s> Ichiro is now one of the greatest baseball player . <\s>
<s> How did he become such a great player ? <\s>
<s> This is due to the fact that he tried new things ; he did not just follow what others were doing . <\s>
<s> Normally , people bat with their dominant side when they are young , but Ichiro did not do that . <\s>
<s> He believed that left side , the non-dominate side for him , would be better because it was closer to first base . <\s>
<s> In addition , he started to move toward first base as he hit , which was also new . <\s>
<s> With these new approaches his hittings improved . <\s>
<s> Now he has become a successful player . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> People often do not want to take risks because they fear that it may cause harm to them . <\s>
<s> But in order to be successful , one must take risks . <\s>
<s> As in the examples stated previously , those that took risks became successful . <\s>
<s> It is the unkown that makes someone different and be successful . <\s>
<s> Young people have always been seen as a future of their community and are expected to work for the betterment of their community . <\s>
<s> I feel that young people do take care and try and help in growing their communities . <\s>
<s> The world is growing and people are well aware that it is ` survival of the fittest ' policy that runs their lives . <\s>
<s> Anybody in that case would want to make a place for their community in this expanding world . <\s>
<s> Young people are very much aware of what the community has done for them and are always ready to help their community by giving in their efforts and time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people know what they mean to the community they belong to and in this social world , they do most of what he can do to help his community . <\s>
<s> For instance we can take an example of Mr. Dhiru Bhai Ambani and his children . <\s>
<s> Mr. Ambani has always been interested in his community which is gujarti . <\s>
<s> He has always been working hard to improve Gujrat as a state . <\s>
<s> And this is continued by their sons Mr. Mukesh and Mr. Anil . <\s>
<s> The men who have their biggest project in Gujrat jus to improve employment and economic condition of their community ( gujaratis ) ... <\s>
<s> They could have that big project in metro politan cities that have better resources and climatic conditions . <\s>
<s> They spend a lot of time to help needy people in Gujrat and do what they can for them So , this can be sighted as one of the best examples for young people do for their community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this world where time is no less than money , people do spend time in charity , sponsoring funds for their community works , helping poor , counsellin their community members , attending their community meetings , finding out ways for the betterment of their community , managing their community functions . <\s>
<s> Young people are more enthusiastically participating in the above mentioned activities which gives them satisfication . <\s>
<s> They try and spend lots of time and work for their community which is worth mentioning . <\s>
<s> We can also take an example of ` Orkut . <\s>
<s> com ' where communities are rapidly increasing . <\s>
<s> Also people registering in each community is increasing day by day . <\s>
<s> This serves as an evidence of how people spend time in helping their communities by giving in forums which are very helpful for the growth of the community . <\s>
<s> Thus young people are the ones who are going to handle their communities and I think they are responsible enough for it !! <\s>
<s> I disagree to the statement that young people today give less time to helping community . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I myself form a relevant example . <\s>
<s> I am twenty-seven years old and have been actively involved in community service for the past six years now . <\s>
<s> I have taken up various types of projects . <\s>
<s> I have given lectures in health camps organized for the slum dwellers . <\s>
<s> I have organized blood donation camps with the colleagues at my workplace . <\s>
<s> While I was in Gemany , I tutored English to students and job-seekers from various parts of the world who had come to Germany for studies and work but could not afford the costly language school . <\s>
<s> Being an Electrical Engineer , I have volunteered to teach professional courses of Electrician , to help people make a living for themselves . <\s>
<s> Currently I am working with a project for rural women . <\s>
<s> I am organising this project in order to build expertise in rural women to take up small tasks which can help them earn a living and also rear the traditional rural art of cooking , stiching , embroidery , etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> And it would not at all be strange to reveal that all the activities that I have mentioned above have been done in groups of fellow young students and professional . <\s>
<s> I name us all `` philanthropic enthusiasts '' . <\s>
<s> I have seen people from different backgrounds joining hands to improve the society around . <\s>
<s> And whenever I have asked the amateurs about the reason behind their interest for community , I have got the same answwer . <\s>
<s> That they all get a strange satisfaction in these volunteer activities . <\s>
<s> This feeling of fulfillment fills the void in their lives which is created by the day to day struggle at university , office , personal relationships , etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In fact , i feel that young people today are more active than they were a decade ago . <\s>
<s> This may in turn be to some part attributed to the education system across the globe . <\s>
<s> Schools and Universitites today mandate that a particular number of hours per week be spent in community service . <\s>
<s> This madate helps student learn the advantages of such work and in the process they start loving it . <\s>
<s> They also realise that how the volunteer work serves dual purpose , of enhancing the community and the individual as well . <\s>
<s> Young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> I am against this statement and have strong points to support myself . <\s>
<s> We read the newspapers and magazines and see that its only the young people dominating the front pages and party scenes . <\s>
<s> This creates a general misconception in people 's minds that the youthful age is the age when life is meant to enjoy rather than when we 're forty or fifty plus . <\s>
<s> We might think that this is true , but if we put ourselves in , say , our father 's shoes . <\s>
<s> We conclude that life is all about going to work in the morning and coming back home tired . <\s>
<s> This is n't fun right ? <\s>
<s> Well , now that a misconception . <\s>
<s> Older people attain enjoyment in places where we do n't see anything but a boring event . <\s>
<s> Let me compare myself and my dad . <\s>
<s> I enjoy myself by going out to the movies with my friends etc. , which I do n't usually see my dad doing . <\s>
<s> Does that mean that my dad does n't enjoy life ? <\s>
<s> Wrong . <\s>
<s> My dad loves his work and takes pleasure in going to work everyday , and even on Sundays . <\s>
<s> He ca n't stand sitting home just lying in front of the television having pizzas and sundaes . <\s>
<s> That was supposed to be fun for me but for my dad , no ! <\s>
<s> My dad really enjoys his early morning yoga sessions and tennis games , and really looks forward to them . <\s>
<s> To me these are nothing but time wasted which could be spent in sleeping , going out to parties etc . <\s>
<s> Whenever I take a close look at my dad I notice that he is really happy and enjoying life to the fullest while I 'm not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Concluding , it all depends on the way we analyze the given statement . <\s>
<s> We may think we 're the ones getting most out of our lives but no , older people also have a life and look forward to it more than we do . <\s>
<s> Many people choose to specialize in one specific subject such as biology , litrature , or business . <\s>
<s> Yet , there are people who have abroad knowlegde of many acadamic fields all together . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is important for a person to expand its knowledge by studying different subjects in different fields . <\s>
<s> Studying different subjects will help people understand more of what is around them . <\s>
<s> If a person studies economics for instance , he/she will understand the economy country very well . <\s>
<s> But can this person complete this subject without using math ? <\s>
<s> Therefore , many programs were built to help students obtain a sense of link between subjects . <\s>
<s> An example of these programs is MYP and PYP , where students are teached to creat a linkage between health and economics for example . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If a person has no knowledge in other subjects he will be lost in many parts of this world . <\s>
<s> For example , if a scientist has specialized in science and only science , he would have a great knowlegde about biology and chemistry but he would be a stranger to other subjects . <\s>
<s> He would not understand politics . <\s>
<s> He would not understand the world around him and what is happening other than in his scientific point of view which has nothing to do with politics and such fields . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects helps in communicating with others . <\s>
<s> For instance , people from different fields can share talks among themselves . <\s>
<s> A scientist will be able to chat about litrature with a historian or an engineerer . <\s>
<s> It will be easier to make friends and chatting mates . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A person with only a specialized subject will have a hard time dealing with his work . <\s>
<s> It might be hard for him to find a job or work at his job when it comes to dealing with other areas other than his field . <\s>
<s> This is why many companies and banks work on training their employees to have them learn more about different subjects . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This is why I think that having a abroad knowledge is better than specializing in one area or feild . <\s>
<s> I believe that the is no easy answer to this question . <\s>
<s> One must consider positive and negative aspects of both forms of learning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One the one hand , it is very important to learn and to know facts , espescially while dealing with complex problems . <\s>
<s> A lack of factual knowledge on a certain subject will render any student unable to properly discuss it with others . <\s>
<s> When being faced with different facts within a conversation , one cannot differentiate whether the information used by one 's counterpart is accurate or false . <\s>
<s> One could be overwhelmed with false information and tricked into believing the counterpart 's position , even if it does not give an accurate picture of the topic . <\s>
<s> A student that has no idea when Abraham Lincoln lived or served his presidency might be convinced by others that he fought for the rights of African Americans in the 1960's instead of during the civil war . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , a mere learning of facts does not reveal to a student the interconnection between them and how one fact might lead to another . <\s>
<s> A student that has learned the names an inauguration dates of all US presidents does not necessarily know anything about their achievements and could therefore never enter an argument on which president best represented the middle class or fought for equal rights . <\s>
<s> This is where the understanding of ideas and concepts becomes important . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I would say that in order to fully grasp any subject and to be able to discuss it with others one has to find a balance between the learning of facts and the understanting of ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> While some students may find it harder to learn facts they might compensate this with a great understanding of the underlying concept and vice versa . <\s>
<s> However , no student should ever completely neglect any of these two forms of learning . <\s>
<s> In a highly competitive market , more and more companies are finding difficult to develop new ways of selling their products . <\s>
<s> One of the most effective way has been advertising in all its layouts . <\s>
<s> However , although the efficiency of advertising has been proved over the past of the years , it has also been a very controversial practise because it does not always present the products as they are in reality . <\s>
<s> That is the reason that explain why thousands of customers complain about the products they buy every year . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I agree with this statement becasue I believe that the bulk of ads that surrounds us daily does not give us an accurately description and image of the product we are going to buy . <\s>
<s> This phenomenon happens frecuently at Christmas . <\s>
<s> During these days , a lot of parents buy gifts for their children and they follow what they see on advertisements either on tv or in the newspapers . <\s>
<s> However , when children open their presents they are not only the ones that are dissapointed , because their parents are also surprised that the product is not as they thought in the beginning . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The point here is that advertisements present products in a very attractive way and they manipulate the image in order to make it appealing for potential customers . <\s>
<s> However , what happens is that the final product is not as good as it was presented or even it has some negative aspects that were hidden in the ad . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most companies outsource their advertising campaigns to others highly-specialized in advertising . <\s>
<s> These ones produce a creative campaign of advertising that introduces a new product or new aspects of an old one in our society . <\s>
<s> With this practice , companies are achieving to sell their products pretty easy and they are obtaining huge amounts of profits . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This advertising trend is just focused in the short-term consequences for a company . <\s>
<s> However , in the long-term , when a company advertises its products in a different way of what they are in reality , it may be losing customers and potential customers in the future because they see that the company is not saying the truth about its products . <\s>
<s> The last consequence of this practise is that a company will lose its position in the market and then all its profitability . <\s>
<s> Ideas consist of facts , and the relation between the two concepts is of a complicated kind . <\s>
<s> Indeed , when we read the statement , it seems natural to argue that understanding ideas is of a better use that to merely learn facts . <\s>
<s> The first is considered as such a noble and deep endeavor whereas the second is depicted as a narrow minded attitude . <\s>
<s> Though we shall not come to conclusion of this kind in such a precaucious manner , and we will strive to analyse the question in a more thoughtfull way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Since we would all , i presume , agree that understanding ideas is more important than learning facts , we should then rather that argueing in this sense , try to explain why this answer seems so obvious and natural . <\s>
<s> Why then , would we all , certainly , tend to value the firts idea and not the second one . <\s>
<s> This a priori , that we all share derives from the fact that we strongly believe that the activity of learning facts requires less of an effort than the one of understanding . <\s>
<s> This belief is widely spread , and it is shared for many good reasons . <\s>
<s> Understanding undoubtadly requires more time and concentration that the learning of facts . <\s>
<s> Yet , most professions , now days , give more importance to acts then they do to thoughts and deepness . <\s>
<s> To pass this test , we are not asked to truely understand the questions that we are asked but simply to answer them in a superficial way . <\s>
<s> Most of us have little or no knoledge of biology or of social science and yet , are goal is to sound like excperts and to bring exact answers . <\s>
<s> Again , we are not asked to think neither about the question nor about the reason why we are here to pass the test , wich behavior would result in an immediate failure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But is society mistaken when it askes us to come to this center and pass the test ? <\s>
<s> No . <\s>
<s> Because we should understand the importance of leraning facts . <\s>
<s> The two concepts meet when the understanding serves our goal . <\s>
<s> I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject and be an expert on that subject than to have broad knowledge of many subjects and not have a specific area of expertise . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having broad knowledge of many subjects does not necessarily show that one is qualified . <\s>
<s> That sort of knowledge can easily be acquired through personal effort and experience , which makes it almost the same thing as what we call ` general knowledge` . <\s>
<s> General knowledge is the accumulation of one 's experience and learnings gained through education and/or quite simply , living . <\s>
<s> Everybody has a general knowledge to some extent , and this knowledge does not bring any bonus points to you in the course of your professional life , no matter how vast it is , especially in an age as competitive as ours . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , specializing in one particular subject gives you the opportunity of being unique . <\s>
<s> There is no limit to how much you can learn and discover on any subject . <\s>
<s> Therefore , it is possible for someone who has chosen to specialize , to go as far as he or she wants with his or her studies , research , experiments , etc . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let us take the profession of conference interpreting as an example . <\s>
<s> It is a must for each and every conference interpreter to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects , since they could be hired to work in many conferences regarding many subjects . <\s>
<s> It is not possible for them to interpret what they hear if they do not understand anything , or if they are not familiar with the particular terminology . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , this certainly does not mean that they are experts , or in other words , that they have specialized in those subjects . <\s>
<s> This does not mean that they are not experts in any subject either . <\s>
<s> What this means is that they are specializing in conference interpreting , and that without their expertise in that particular area , their abilities to simultaneously listen and talk , their knowledge of interpreting techniques , their broad knowledge on many subjects would not do them any good . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , in an environment as competitive as the current one , where you have to stand out in order to be able to achieve certain standards in your life , you can not just settle for a broad knowledge of many subjects . <\s>
<s> You certainly have to have your area of expertise , an area where you are unique , and where you are willing to pursue that `` uniqueness '' to the furthest extent possible . <\s>
<s> Young people nowadays indeed do not give enough time helping their communities . <\s>
<s> There are various reasons for this . <\s>
<s> Most young people nowadays are engrossed in making a successful career and settling down during their youth . <\s>
<s> Most youngsters do n't really care what happens around them because they are too self-centered . <\s>
<s> Also , the economic conditions of their life too influence whether young people work for their communities or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today 's world demonstrates the Darwinian principle , `` the fittest survive '' on a day-to-day basis , though not across species , but within the human species . <\s>
<s> In the extreme race to achieve high goals that they set for themselves , youngsters hardly give any thought to the community around them . <\s>
<s> Most of their time is dedicated to the achievement of their goals and themselves , and not much is left for community service . <\s>
<s> The fact that it is rare to find anyone volunteering for community service ( rather than being punished with it ) shows how less youngsters nowadays care for community service . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason why youngsters nowadays do n't give much time for community service is the profound change in mindset of youngsters . <\s>
<s> They are more materialistic than ever . <\s>
<s> Few youngsters know the pleasure , satisfaction and elation of dedicating oneself for the service of others , nowadays . <\s>
<s> More addicted to the material pleasures of the world , they spare no thought of community service . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This change in mindset has not been sudden , perhaps . <\s>
<s> Over the years and generations , parents impress the importance of community service less on their children , they themselves being materialistic . <\s>
<s> Thus , gradually , children might have no notion of community service whatsoever . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The economic conditions in which the stidents are brought up also influences the perspective they develop about community service . <\s>
<s> If a student is from a poor family , in which most of his time is consumed in his fight for survival , it is less probable that he might be interested in serving the community . <\s>
<s> But this argument can be confronted with the fact that he might know the pains of being poor , and hence help the poor in the future . <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , economic conditions do play a role in students perception of community service . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thus in essence , pressure from all aspects of life keep today 's youth from giving enough time helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Further , other issues like the change in mindset of people of all age groups , selfishness , and economic conditions are a major cause . <\s>
<s> It is often said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> Some people might agree with this statement because of the probability of innovation by trying new things . <\s>
<s> However , I disagree with this statement in that knowing how to do well is as much important as trying new one , and doing familiar is more secure than taking risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , doing what people already know is very important as much as trying new one . <\s>
<s> People who do only what they already know how to do well often lead them to be an expert of their fields . <\s>
<s> Because they do the same work repeatedily , they may know many useful information of the work . <\s>
<s> For example , my uncle is an owner of a restaurant . <\s>
<s> the restaurant had succeeded from his grandparents , and my uncle has workd there for his entire life , and he did n't try to do new things even though he felt bored with the work . <\s>
<s> Now , his restaurant is very famous traditional restaurant in my city , Seoul , S.Korea . <\s>
<s> He knows well the recipes of the menu , and sometimes teaches the skill to his workers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition , when it comes to the safety of work , doing familiar things guarantees more stable life . <\s>
<s> Some might say that many innovative inventions were from the trial new things and taking some risks . <\s>
<s> However , the successes were very small parts of the trials . <\s>
<s> Much more people have failed at those trials and risks . <\s>
<s> Moreover , many successful professionals like doctors and lecturer have shown that their skillful work style was the key of their successes , but not just trying new and innovative things . <\s>
<s> Their work is very safe as well . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it 's not bad to try new things and find other ways in their fields , but it is not the best way to succeed in their fields . <\s>
<s> This is because the importance and safety of doing what they already know how to do well cannot be underestimated . <\s>
<s> I do not completely agree with the statement that in twenty years of time there will be fewer cars in use as compared to the present . <\s>
<s> The present time is marked with great developments in the technology of cars . <\s>
<s> There is huge compettition in the market where industries are striving to design and manufacture more and more sophisticated and advanced machines . <\s>
<s> Highly innovative and modern features are consistently being added to the older models in order to attract customers . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There is a plethora of cars that require only their brand name to sound `` big '' and thus maintain their superior postion in the market like the `` mercedeez benz '' or the `` limousine '' which are owned by only the very affluent class . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Therefore , at the time when the market of a product is at such a high and when further advancements have been promised by numerous companies in this field , twenty years is too small a period of time to mark a decrease in the use of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Though in wealthy countries , cars may not be a very expensive luxury to own , there are countries where people still save money with a dream to own a car one day which would make family trips and outings more convenient and enjoyable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Children aspire to have a car of their own with numerous features . <\s>
<s> The younger generation still craves for fancy models , racing cars , and other expensive brands . <\s>
<s> So there is no reason which can accont for and explain a decrease in the use of a cars in the near future . <\s>
<s> This might be a posiibility for more distant future when fossil fuels start to show a marked decrease , but then the future might be embracing Solar cars and cars driven by other non-conservative sources of energy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today , when cars have become a household item , and when it becomes difficult to imagine of a whole day without having a car . <\s>
<s> It becomes difficult to pass even a single day away from your car when it may be having its share of time with the mechanic , and you feel handicapped . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It has become a necessity today because of the conveniances it adds to our life . <\s>
<s> More and more companies are intoducing attractive and alluring models into the market . <\s>
<s> A fall in such a prospective and lucrative market in recent future has not enough grounds . <\s>
<s> Today innovation is the main task which finds many supporters not only in commercial terms but also in academic , artistic and social ones . <\s>
<s> Competition is existed in every detail of our lives and to achieve anything needs more hard working , devotion and talent , Of course copying or cheating different situations , projects may serve people success in an extend but this will be temporary and with a limiteg utility . <\s>
<s> Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . <\s>
<s> Doing similar things in routine ways makes alienatiaon in humans and alienation efffect resuts with a decrease in performance and avoids people to learn new ways of doing things . <\s>
<s> Alienation results with unsuccess and failure . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some people insists the idea of ` the best way is the way you already know ' but in this situation one can never learn and practise other ways . <\s>
<s> On the other way if a person tries new solutions and new techniques of doing jobs , success will certainly follow these trials , One can differentiate himself with his competitors and upgrades his talents . <\s>
<s> The most famous and well known characters of the history both in art and science appreciate to use different ways . <\s>
<s> Einstein , Mozart ond others had n't followed their ancestors and by upgrating themselves and looking for new ways they received achievement . <\s>
<s> Every new thing adds new talents and information to a person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Taking risks is an important phenomenon in the way that brings people success . <\s>
<s> Conservative people do not favor of taking risks but innovative people do . <\s>
<s> Doing jobs in ordinary way gives people average result but taking risk and trying new solutions may lead extreme failure or success . <\s>
<s> If a person tries new things and looks for development it would not be ordinary for him to face failure in all times . <\s>
<s> Ultimately it is inevitable that by practising new things he would get the achievement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up trying new things and taking risks may lead people failure several times but a <\s>
<s> The given statement sounds to me as it implements that young people have better things do than to spend time with their communities . <\s>
<s> In general I agree with the given statement . <\s>
<s> As far as I know it was more common to help in the community a century ago . <\s>
<s> The society structure those days was different then today . <\s>
<s> Not only that the number of inhabitants rised with the time and we have much bigger communities today , also people mostly live in big cities now and not in small communities like then . <\s>
<s> At the same time the structure of the communities changed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nowadays the work which was done in a community many years ago is done by other institutions now . <\s>
<s> The state is much more responsible in welfare-questions or questions concearning social security in recent years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When communities were smaller , people helped themselves out in times when someone was sick , or needed help because he or she was old or could not work anymore . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Today , I think , people and especially young people are very concerned about their own life . <\s>
<s> Time is rare , at least for people that have a job and \ or a family . <\s>
<s> They need their time to manage their hoseholds . <\s>
<s> But if they have the slightest bit of time that they can determine by themselves , I am sure they use it for their own amusement , for cultur , fun , sports or just to spend the time with their friends and family . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I do n't know anyone out of my group of friends who is somehow involved with community-work . <\s>
<s> Neighther am I. The reason for this is for sure the change in society and also in social values . <\s>
<s> The interrests changed as well . <\s>
<s> One reason people are less interrested in politics , social life or in their own communities might be the increasing anonymity in society . <\s>
<s> So many people live on a very small area and do n't know each other . <\s>
<s> No wonder that they do not even care for each other anymore . <\s>
<s> I disagree with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' . <\s>
<s> I think having a broad field of knowledge is as important as specializing in one particular subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Having a broad knowledge of many academic field only allows one to know the shallower part of each subject . <\s>
<s> One who does not specialize in any field can only be deemed as `` amateur '' , not `` professional '' . <\s>
<s> A person with broad knowledge in many academic fields but no deep insights in any subject can never design gadgets as well as professional engineers do ; they can never navigate planes as well as professional aviators do ; they can never compose music pieces as remarkably as musicians do ... <\s>
<s> Hence , we need people who specialize in one specific subject to make our world a better place and to run our society smoothly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , specializing in one one particular subject has drawbacks as well . <\s>
<s> For example , in Singapore , the universities place too much emphasis on specialized knowledge . <\s>
<s> That leads to a work force that is rather narrow-minded . <\s>
<s> As a result , Singaporeans tend to be less creative and less likely to think out of the box . <\s>
<s> Also , people with different academic field might have difficulty in communicating with each other , making people more isolated . <\s>
<s> On the contrary , the tertiary education in the United States emphasizes on both specialized and broad knowledge of the students . <\s>
<s> It makes people more prepared to make sound dicisions in complicated circumstances which involves different academic fields . <\s>
<s> For instance , a politician who specializes in Politics only will not be able to make sound sound policies in environmental problems . <\s>
<s> It is also likely that he might take the lobbists ' words blindly . <\s>
<s> Hence , it is also important for one to have a broad range of knowedge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I think it is equally important for one to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and to specialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> Some people think that it is more important for students to understnad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . <\s>
<s> However , I believe students need to learn facts rather than ideas amd concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , students can learn what they should do or should not do from facts . <\s>
<s> When they learn consequences of a certain fact , they will know that the fact should be done again or not . <\s>
<s> For example , if students learn about wars , they will know that people should not fight each other again . <\s>
<s> Since students wll learn that wars cause so many deaths from the wars which occured in the past , they would think that wars are not acceptable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , while Ideas and concepts can be very complicated and difficult to understand , facts are easy to understand . <\s>
<s> For instance , when students learn the concept of `` dilemma '' , they may not understand the meaning completely . <\s>
<s> However , if they learn examples of `` dilemma '' , they would understand easily and deeply . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , facts are related to real life . <\s>
<s> Therefore , students can match their experience with the facts they have learnt . <\s>
<s> As a result , they can predict what will hapen next and prevent bad consequences . <\s>
<s> For example , there was a huge earthquak in Japan and a lot of people died becase furniture in the house hit them . <\s>
<s> If students learn about that , they can prevent it from happning again by attaching furniture to walls . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , facts provide students with more useful information than ideas and concept does . <\s>
<s> Success - All about EXPERIMENTING <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Success is a right combination or a medley of Hard wrok , Experience , Perseverance , Expertise and also experimenting . <\s>
<s> People become successful only when they have the quench to do things and that thrist to achieve newer origins keep them striving to reach their destination ... <\s>
<s> As said by a philosopher and I quote , Success does n't come in an over night . <\s>
<s> It is the result of the turmoil you take to be a successful person . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I think that sucess comes to you when you are adept at a particular skill , I agree that success is about meeting the demands and thus proving yourself by satisfying the needs of the people around you . <\s>
<s> In order to do this you need to change , adapt to the newer environment and try experimenting new things and thus tuning to the present .. <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For instance a person who has a well reputed pizza corner should always try to experiment new things by adding different flavours , spices or even changing the outlook of the corner he owns ... <\s>
<s> A well reputed musician in carnatic music which is an old form of indian music can always try innovative ideas to improve the form of music to keep in track of the younger generation who are more into hip hop and jazz ... <\s>
<s> This already succesful musician doesnt have to start from the roots but rather just enrich his knowledge . <\s>
<s> The list goes on from the invention of electric bulb by Thomas alva edision to the discovery of periodic table by Demetri mendeleev .. <\s>
<s> All the advancements in the techonlogies from Gramaphone to the latest ultra slim mobiles phones and ipods are a result of people trying out new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Variety is the spice of life .. <\s>
<s> Yes indeed it is .. <\s>
<s> But it also involves risk but isnt the ability to withstand the risk factor and fight for the odds is an easy task for a Successful person ... <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So , to stand one in a crowd , to be recognised , to be successful continue to try new things which vigorate you and do this with diligence and a bit of creativity . <\s>
<s> I agree with the idea that it is essential for successful people to challenge new things and difficulties rather than only doing what they repeat same things which they know how to do . <\s>
<s> I have two reasons for my idea : growth and gaining more knowledge . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It might be quite difficult for people to succeed some challenges because all success is surrounded by dificulties . <\s>
<s> When we can deal with difficulties , we can succeed . <\s>
<s> For example , when I was a high school student and I studied so hard every day beause I wanted to enter the famous university for my studying and for my future . <\s>
<s> At that time , it was so hard for me to do both going to the high school and doing to the secondary school for more studying at night . <\s>
<s> I thought I might give up entering the high level of university many times . <\s>
<s> However , finally , I could pass the exam and entered the famous university which my parents and I also longed for . <\s>
<s> Along side , I realized that there are always difficulties for the success . <\s>
<s> Wnen we achieve the goals and challenges , we can grow ourselves as well as get the best results . <\s>
<s> Moreover , there are many risks for challenges such as whether I can pass the exam or not . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Additinally , we need to gain more knowledge for the success . <\s>
<s> If the person wants to be a doctor , he or she needs to study harder than usual students which go to common universities . <\s>
<s> To become a doctors , it is necesarry to study hard and gain the special knowledge beause they have a responsibility for all lives of patients . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they always face with taking risks as well as the success as a doctor . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , it is clear that successful people always try to challenge new things , to grow themselves and seek for more difficulties . <\s>
<s> At the same time , they also take risks . <\s>
<s> It might seem to be hard , however , I think it is essential for people who want to succeed to challenge new things and take risks . <\s>
<s> Personal intrests are far more important than the intrests of the community , especially in a world where it requires utter dedication and hardwork to survive . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the yesteryears , the world would have been moving at a far more relaxed pace and never this competant . <\s>
<s> This not only enabled young people to dedicate their time but also their energies toward their community there by taking it forward . <\s>
<s> Not only this , there would have been much less distraction to their work . <\s>
<s> For example , if we take a student pursuing studies at a university , he would had to deal with far less competition in his studies . <\s>
<s> There by allowing him to allocate certain amount of his time for community activities . <\s>
<s> With less population in olden days , there were sufficient opportunities for suitable young people to work at their hometowns - giving them an opportunity to work with their communities . <\s>
<s> The young people of the bygone days would never have had to deal with the pressures of contemporary times . <\s>
<s> Hence there would have been an obvious amount of time for them to work towrds their communities development . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The situations which the current generation of young people have in their hands are far from what the young people from the bygone days would have had to endure . <\s>
<s> They have to deal with constant pressure to succede in life without loosing out much . <\s>
<s> And young ones of this generation are often burdened with the responsibilities of family . <\s>
<s> This definitely leave them with very little time and energy to work towards their communities . <\s>
<s> Adding to this , the everlasting temptation to earn more money and enjoy the luxuries that other seem to enjoy , which in a sense not a negative thing at all . <\s>
<s> After all every single indivudial has the desire to enjoy his life to the fullest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I therefore conclude that , it is not wise to accuse the younger generation of not being able to apens much time for their communities , given the desire their reach great heights in life . <\s>
<s> Technology is ever-changing . <\s>
<s> A genius is born every now and then , who brings about new inventions into the limelight . <\s>
<s> If these inventions are beneficial to mankind then they soon replace the old ones . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One such example is the mode of transport before automobiles were discovered . <\s>
<s> People either travelled by foot or they used the help of animals like horses , donkeys etc .. <\s>
<s> Then came the invention of the wheel after which carts were made . <\s>
<s> These carts were driven by bulls and these bullock carts became the means of travelling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Further , engines were invented , which led to the production of automobiles i.e. both two wheelers and four wheelers . <\s>
<s> Currently many cars have been manufactured and are available in the market . <\s>
<s> Every year , a new model is designed , having a better engine efficiency , greater mileage , a different size or simply a different seating arrangement . <\s>
<s> These new versions soon become popular in the market . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Just as how we have transformed from a bullock cart to a car for our mode of transport , in the same way twenty years hence there is a possibility for the invention of something else that is novel . <\s>
<s> But the question is - `` what next ? ! '' <\s>
<s> . <\s>
<s> Could it be a car which flies or could it be a locomotive which looks like a spaceship ? . <\s>
<s> The design of this new locomotive is left to the imagination and skill of the inventor . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Since , this new invention would then become famous in the market , the demand for cars would eventually reduce . <\s>
<s> As a result of this , fewer cars would be used twenty years hence . <\s>
<s> The question whether young people enjoy life more than the older generations . <\s>
<s> It is an intriguing question . <\s>
<s> as one might feel that the energetic young people , are more likely to have enjoyable experiences compared to the senile old people . <\s>
<s> However i completely disagree with the statement and feel that enjoyment in life is not constrained by age . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For one reason i beleive that age has no bearing on the good moments in life is when i see an old person jogging around merrily in the park compared to a young guy suffering from lung disorders , admitted in the hodpital , resulting from smoking . <\s>
<s> The younger generation could be sometimes be too careless and headlong in their approach towards life as compared to the old and mature folks . <\s>
<s> The young people believe that they should go for everything they feel will give them pleasure and live every moment to the fullest . <\s>
<s> In doing that they present an outer picture of joy happiness but it could not be so good afterall . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ok lets talk about sports , ever wondered about the young players on the field and the older retired players sitting in the commentary box describing every action of the game . <\s>
<s> Does n't the game give the same amount of pleasure to both on field , young players and off field old guys who are thrilled and nostalgic of their times . <\s>
<s> Can we qantify their enjoyment ? , we cant . <\s>
<s> Each of us enjoy in a different way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The older people have much more experiences and lessons from their life which they can share with their friends and childrens . <\s>
<s> I agree an old man cant race his motorbike or overspeed , the popular source of fun for the younger generations , but doesnt an old man enjoy playing with his grandson or teaching him a game of chess , or riding a bicycle . <\s>
<s> Cant he reflect upon the achievements of his life and feel contented . <\s>
<s> Its a matter of how we take life and cherish its moments . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , Its not about age , enjoyment in life is solely about our approach towards life , For some people life begins at forty . <\s>
<s> I have seen so many old aged convivial gourmets who still enjoy tasting the wine and educating the younger people about the various wines . <\s>
<s> Its just one simple example which depicts that age doesnt restrict enjoyment . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I ultimately beleive that enjoyment in life transcends the boundaries set by factors like age or health . <\s>
<s> Senility could be a period of tremendous fun and enjoyment . <\s>
<s> Young or old joy , is knocking our doors , we need to open the door . <\s>
<s> Since the serial manifacturing of cars , they had become a really important part of human lives , as they decreased the time required for transportation . <\s>
<s> As people 's needs for transportation will not decrease , it is really hard to say that there will be fewer cars in the near future . <\s>
<s> People use cars in their everyday lives and , for people today , it is hard to imagine any period of time without cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There had been other forms of transportation in the past , but ; none has been used as frequently as modern cars . <\s>
<s> One could claim that a newer form of transport may evolve . <\s>
<s> Some people even say that , we may be able to teleport in the near future , however ; this suggestion has yet only lived in science fiction books . <\s>
<s> Therefore , in the near future , as near as twenty years , people are unlikely to see a newer form of invention that will close the era of modern cars . <\s>
<s> Cars ' looks , types of fuel they use or their engine systems may change , but ; after all , they will still be cars . <\s>
<s> Even if cars began not to move on four wheels , but ; instead , started to fly ; as we see in science fiction movies like `` Back To The Future '' , they would still be called `` cars '' . <\s>
<s> That is because , they will still be belonging to an individual and be used just like the way we use them today . <\s>
<s> As stated before , their way of working , that is ; their engine system , ignition type , fuels etc. may change ; however , they will still be `` the personal transportation device '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a result , when we look at the 20th and the beginning of 21st century , it is almost impossible to see cars vanish from the market all of a sudden . <\s>
<s> Lots of people are happy with this as well , as long as oil prices are kept at a reasonable price . <\s>
<s> Maybe , the 22nd century will become free of cars and car addicts would surely be glad that they are not to see those times . <\s>
<s> Let us begin by defining `` suceess '' and `` successful people '' . <\s>
<s> Success by far is something that has different meanings for different people . <\s>
<s> The measure of success , the time period to get there and the importance of it are things which are distinct to every individual . <\s>
<s> The world might view a Bill Gates or a Laxmi Mittal as a successful person but for me my father is the most successful person i know . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So I proceed on the assumption that we are referring to a successful person with reference to the economics of it and not to the essence of it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Successful people seldom think of the consequences of risk as they have seen and endured the climb up the ladder of success and know exactly what it entails to get there . <\s>
<s> The sweat , the toil , the experience in itself gives them the energy to dream further and those dreams accompanied by the passion to get there remove all apprehensions to take any risks . <\s>
<s> They take risks to try new things , things that probably intrigue them or things that they have always dreamed of achieving and did not have the capacity to achieve earlier . <\s>
<s> Having achieved a level of performance in what they already know how to do well they aspire to venture into new avenues and if the same involves taking a calculated risk they would not abstain from it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Risks are essential if one needs to evolve as a professional or as a person-these are not the words of a luminary but views that I personally ascribe to . <\s>
<s> To discover new things , new worlds , new prospects and new ideologies , taking risks is something that should not be seen as a negative attribute but a positive one . <\s>
<s> Apprehensions or fears can bring in a life which will always lack the drive and passion that make business barons like Laxmi Mittal and Ambanis achieve their status . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Coming back to the topic of this essay , I would state that I do agree with the statement that `` Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' to the extent that it is not a restrictive statement . <\s>
<s> Success is something subjective and I strongly believe that any person whether `` successful '' by worldly standards or not would aspire to do new things and will take the risk to get there <\s>
<s> I mainly agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> Advertisements are presented in such a professional way that they are able to make costumers believe they need excactly the product which is shown . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Advertisement is made to show you everything the product can do or how it changes your daily life in a very positive manner . <\s>
<s> There is never shown a negative aspect . <\s>
<s> The key is , that advertisement is mostly placed at television in the late evening when the people are watching a show or a film and do not want to think about what they look at . <\s>
<s> So they do not think about all the negative aspects the product may have , they listen to the music , which is of course perfectly chosen , they see images of great landscapes or happy families so that they are in a very positive mood . <\s>
<s> And that is just what the company wants their consumers to be in , a positive mood , where you are more likely to buy products of every kind , even if you do not need them at all . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , they are tested with a small audience before they are released so that the company who invented the advertisement can change some kind of it if the test audience critizes it a lot , so there is an improved kind of quality controll . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another aspect is , that the firm who produces the food or whatever has to be advertised , does not create the advertisement itself in most cases . <\s>
<s> They engage a company which is a speciallist in advertisements and so they know everything about what their consumers want to see . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> At the end it is important that the statemant includes not every advertisement ever made . <\s>
<s> There are big exceptions from that rule , for example when you see a saucege crashing into a wall it does not animate me to buy a safe car . <\s>
<s> And you must allways remember that they only create an illusion , when you buy the product just because of its advertisement without comparing it depending on real facts with other products , you will not have much fun with your new product . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I have to admit that advertisements are influencing everybody 's shopping behaviour a lot because they are able to present the product in a nearly perfect way . <\s>
<s> The question at hand is that `` will there be fewer cars in use after twenty years than there today '' . <\s>
<s> The automobile technology has been climbing acclivities of advancements over the past few years . <\s>
<s> But at the same time the challenge introduced due to the fast depleting petroleum resources has impeded high hopes of the industry . <\s>
<s> But still i would say that the industry would continue to flourish irrespective of the fore mentioned challenge due to several reasons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The most pressing reason would be the earnest researches in the field of new and renewable sources of energy to substitute of petroleum . <\s>
<s> A few companies have already come up with electrical cars while the researchs on the hydrogen cells are speeding up . <\s>
<s> These energy sources not only answers the challenges of depleting petroleum resources but also picturises an ecofriendly future generation cars . <\s>
<s> This is because the expected emission from electrical or hydrogen cell based cars are much lower than the cars of today . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Although the initial price range of the new generation cars are rated above the cars of today , the running cost is expected to be considerably less . <\s>
<s> For example in the case of an electrical car the running cost is all about chargin the cell which would be much cheaper compared to the oil prices twenty years later . <\s>
<s> So in the long run the next generation cars would be cheaper than the pesent day cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another important factor is that pocessing a car has become an important part of ones social dignity . <\s>
<s> The purpose of buying a car has grown much beyond the sole purpose of transportation . <\s>
<s> The hype on the Formula1 racing and automobile exibitions has has influenced people in all strata of the society . <\s>
<s> Despite the rise in oil prices the number of car buyers has never looked down . <\s>
<s> The media has been quite successful in transforming the once adomant car market into an inelastic senario . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When all the automobile industries have charged up their research sectors and with the existing media hype it is impossible to belive that the auto industry will collapse . <\s>
<s> On the one hand , I think that learning facts can be an advantage for students since they can have a sort of role model to help them understand the facts . <\s>
<s> They can easily learn how to do things by learning what someone before them did . <\s>
<s> They can easily make out the person 's mistakes and see what went wrong and what not to do if they want to succed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But on the other hand , I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is way better for students because if one wants to repeat something , it would be easier for him if he has understood what he wants to do instead of juste copying something he has learned . <\s>
<s> In that way , he can avoid making the same mistakes . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , he will be able to shape his own personality and we know that it is generally upheld that someone with a lot of personality is better treated than someone plain who just follows the flock . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Here in France , the way Philosophy is taught to students is very peculiar . <\s>
<s> Indeed , in France , students are n't only taught the doctrine of the authors but they are also taught to become philosophers . <\s>
<s> I know that can sound ambitious and risky but I think that it 's an exellent way to shape the students ' spirit . <\s>
<s> Instead of just teaching them doctrines that they do n't reaaly care about , they are told what the philosophers said but also what they think about that . <\s>
<s> They do n't have to simply learn by heart some doctrines that they do n't really understand , they are also askek to react to that doctrine and to say wether they agree or not . <\s>
<s> I think that 's great because no matter how intelligent and brilliant these philosophers were , we ca n't reaaly take all they said for garnted . <\s>
<s> As students and even as human beings we have to react towards some doctrine sucha as Nietzch 's . <\s>
<s> We can really learn what he said and believe that he is right just because he was a smart man . <\s>
<s> Indeed , let 's not forget that Hitler was inspired by him and used his work in order to justify Nazism . <\s>
<s> Furthermore , the great philosopher , Aristotle , thought that slavery was natural . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> All in all , what we can say is that as students , we can take all that our teachers tell us for granted . <\s>
<s> We absolutely have to think by ourselves and must not simply lear facts . <\s>
<s> Thinking by ourselves will help us in the future for example when we will have to vote . <\s>
<s> There is an enthusiastically held discussion taking place at the moment at my university in Heidelberg . <\s>
<s> Students and professors are discussing if it would be better to have a more broad knowledge or if it is preferable to specialize during the studies . <\s>
<s> I think that a specialization is better . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One of the reasons why I think it is better to specialize is the professional career . <\s>
<s> People with higher qualification in a certain area usually earn more money than unskilled or semi-skilled workers . <\s>
<s> The higher your qualification , the higher your sallary . <\s>
<s> I study translation and I know that only translators with a specialization in a special area , like engineering , accounting or medecine , have the opportunity to find a job and earn some money . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The second reason why I am in favour of specialization is self-confidence . <\s>
<s> I have made the experience that I am becoming much more self confindent when I have the feeling of being an expert in something . <\s>
<s> Translation is a good example again . <\s>
<s> Only if I have learnt all the necessary vocabulary and all the grammar rules I feel competent and able to do my job appropriately . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another reason to specialize is the life-long learning aspect . <\s>
<s> If I once have a certain kowledge I should continue to learn , and this is true for my whole life . <\s>
<s> If an engineer , for instance , needs to work in a foreign country he can still learn the appropriate language . <\s>
<s> But first of all , he needs to be an engineer . <\s>
<s> He still has enough time to learn additional competences when he needs them . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am absolutely convinced that it is wright to continue with my translation studies before I switch over to learn anything else . <\s>
<s> I am sure that this is the right way in order to earn my own money after university and to feel self-confident in my everyday life . <\s>
<s> In addition , I can still learn things in other scientific fields when I have my university degree . <\s>
<s> But to earn this degree is the most important task for me at the moment . <\s>
<s> It is often assumed that working things the right way , the way we are taught , is a major key to success . <\s>
<s> I believe that this statement is right . <\s>
<s> However I believe real success happens to those who bring in new ideas and take risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It is true that when people are taught to work on something and do it the right way they will be efficient and successful . <\s>
<s> For example , someone who has been taught how to make cookies and how to run a shop could open a cookie shop and be successful at selling cookies . <\s>
<s> I can see no reason at all why this person would not earn his life by selling cookies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , take someone pretty creative and who enjoys taking risks . <\s>
<s> This person would open a cookie shop and sell cinnamon flavoured cookies as well as cherry flavoured cookies , and this way differentiate itself from other cookie shops . <\s>
<s> There are two endings to this story , this new business is a complete failure or a real success . <\s>
<s> This person has taken risks and invested in its new ideas without knowing if these would meet the costumers ' tastes or not . <\s>
<s> And if this creative person succeeds , I am convinced that its business will outline the common cookie shop business . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another success that is engendered by taking risks is the self satisfaction that is brings . <\s>
<s> Being successful for its own idea is far more gratifying than doing things right . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Great successes that qre famous worldwide are always born from an innovative concept , and this in all areas . <\s>
<s> Famous film directors would not be so famous if they did not introduce a new vision of film directing . <\s>
<s> In finance , brokers that earn the most are those who take the most significant and relevant risks . <\s>
<s> Bill Gate would not be worldly known ( and immensely wealthy ) if he had not invested in a revolutionary idea . <\s>
<s> The number of cars has been continuously increasing in the last fifty years . <\s>
<s> This brought to the result that cities are getting more and more crowed every year , especially big cities in which it is becoming almost impossible to go around by car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A great solution to this problem is to improve public transportations and I believe in the last years we have been trying to do so . <\s>
<s> Using buses , subways and any other kind of public transportation will give a chance to our cities to be less crowed by cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Plus in twenty years our public transportation will improve with no doubt , the service will be more efficient giving less chances to be late for the people who use it . <\s>
<s> Thus owning a car wo n't be convinient anymore . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even today people tend to choose to go around without cars because using your own car takes much more time and brings a lot of more stress in your day . <\s>
<s> Simply finding a place to park most of the times takes lot of efford and often it will not be near the place we need to go . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I believe in twenty years prices of transportations will decrease as well . <\s>
<s> Starting from planes , their prices will be cheaper and long trip wo n't be done by cars anymore , too long and unconfortable compared to cheap plain tickets . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We also have to consider the increasing growth of population . <\s>
<s> Cities are already crowded with cars nowadays , if we do n't find a way to reduce them , we really will not be able to live in a city any more . <\s>
<s> Finding a way to make people use other transportations will be necessary and inevitable . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> About searching new ways I completely believe technology is the best answer we can find . <\s>
<s> I 'm positive that in twenty years technology will step forward many times giving us new imputs and solutions to deal with the problem of cars , and all this new improvements will definitely make people own fewer cars then today . <\s>
<s> Who does n't have a car nowadays ? <\s>
<s> Cars have become the easiest way of getting from one point to another , either to make short distances or to travel at the other side of a country . <\s>
<s> Cars are one of the things ( with the cell phone ) that today 's occidental population could n't live without . <\s>
<s> How will it be in the next few years ? <\s>
<s> Will people suddenly stop using them ? <\s>
<s> We will try to give points that show that the number of cars on earth is going to be higher and higher , and that in twenty years , people will still use them as their favorite means of transport . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> We can start by saying that even if the gas prices did n't stop increasing those few last years and people coul n't stop complaining about it , it did n't prevent them from driving no matter what . <\s>
<s> A car is something everybody needs , and they wo n't stop using it even though their own wages had to be spent on gas . <\s>
<s> It 's a little bit like smoking , even if the government keeps rising the prices of cigarettes , people would not stop smoking until public and private areas start prohibiting them to do so . <\s>
<s> People have become car addicted , and it will take a long time to change that . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Besides , driving has become a pretty cheap way to travel compared to the other means of transport such as trains or planes . <\s>
<s> For people who ca n't offer flying , cars appear to be a good way for them of being able to escape from their life , to take a break . <\s>
<s> Cars are seen by many people such as teenagers as a key to reach freedom . <\s>
<s> You can go everywhere with a car as long as it 's rolling . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> How can we prevent people from having their owm freedom even if it turns to be bad for the environment ? <\s>
<s> We ca n't , that 's why cars will always be part of our lives , tyoday , tommorrow , or twenty years from now . <\s>
<s> I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people . <\s>
<s> When people are young they always want to challenge things , and are very energetic . <\s>
<s> However older people have to work , to maintain their lifestyle and has already become calm . <\s>
<s> Therefore I believe young enjoy life more than older people . <\s>
<s> I will explain my reasons in the following essay . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Young people are always trying to do new things so they are very active which makes them enjoy their life . <\s>
<s> Generally young people dont have to think about others and just think about their own life . <\s>
<s> Therefore they can do whatever they want to do . <\s>
<s> For instance , if they want to go on a trip just to disocover something , they can do it easily . <\s>
<s> However if they get older and have a family to support , it will become difficult for them to do so . <\s>
<s> When people are young they have many chances and opportunities to change their future lives . <\s>
<s> Thus they can just do what they want to do . <\s>
<s> And when people do what they want to do , they enjoy their lives to the fullest . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Older people generally already have a job and some have families . <\s>
<s> Therefore it makes them hard for them to have the time to do their hobbies , or to travel . <\s>
<s> And to support their families , they have to make a lot of money so it is not easy to quit their jobs just to challenge their dreams . <\s>
<s> Older people cannot just do what they want to do because it would affect many other things . <\s>
<s> As they in a stricted situation , it is difficult for them to enjoy their lives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do . <\s>
<s> It is very difficult for older people to do what they want to do because it effects other things such as their family . <\s>
<s> However young people dont have to think about those things and can challenge whatever they want to do . <\s>
<s> Therefore I believe young people enjoy life more than older people . <\s>
<s> Manufacturers inform the consumers about their products with the means of advertising . <\s>
<s> The more charming an advertisement is , it leads to an increase in the sales of the product , but there are special occasions , where the advertisement makes product seem much better , or cannot give adequate information about the benefit that product supplies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Most of the advertisements are making the products seem much better that the observer of the information does not realize the consequences of using or buying the product may cause . <\s>
<s> Best examples for these types of advertisements are cosmetic products , such as wrinkle fixing creams , and , alcohol . <\s>
<s> When the aim is to make product seem much better . <\s>
<s> the company does not mention about the condictions of usage or side effects of theproduct may cause . <\s>
<s> Mostly , cosmetic products creates effective changes when they are used for a specified amount of time and in terms of continuous usage . <\s>
<s> However , in the advertisement , with a change of scene , the improvement may be observed in an exagerrated manner . <\s>
<s> Besides , the side effects that the product may cause are not shown or told in the advertisement ; in presenting the drinks containing alcohol , there is just a small caution written as ` Dr'nk Responsively` , however , people may not observe a person on the screne , who has a tremendous headache and feeling discomfortable in the stomach . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , some of the advertisements does not reflect the benefits that the product will bring . <\s>
<s> These types of advertisements lack giving relevant information because of the legal issues , while the government provides several restrictions for obtaining a fair competition between the manufacturers of the similar products . <\s>
<s> In a conferance , it has been told that for a specific brand of shampoo , achieved reduction of loss of quality of hair was in higher quantity that has been indicated in the advertisement , while administrative board of advertising has certain rules for idetification of improvements . <\s>
<s> Also , this understatement of improvements cause loss of reliability on the product , and company loses the profit that may be obtained from improvements . <\s>
<s> So , there is a trade-off for preparing advertisements with respect to the borders that laws specify . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , there are no limitations for misguiding people about the benefits of a product , but there are certain rules that should be obeyed , when preparing an advertisement . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the producers reflecting an overwhelming advertisements are limited not to go further , while benefitial products are proposed with their value , less than the real one . <\s>
<s> I strongly believe that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , the main cause for this being so is that that 's precisely the aim of advertisments . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During the 20th century , the approach on selling products have shifted from believing that having a good product was enough to sell it , to believing that aggresive marketing was a must . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This means that nowadays companies believe that having a good product is not enough , but that you must make the public aware of your product and convince it of how good your product actually is . <\s>
<s> But , why is n't enough to show a good product as it really is ? <\s>
<s> Simply because such an approach would n't make most products stand out in the wide varierty of products now available . <\s>
<s> Let 's look , for example , at washing machine 's soaps : every company , from Ariel to Ala , claim their soap is tremendously better than any other competitor . <\s>
<s> Or car manufacturer 's : every single brand states their cars are the fastest and most secure cars in the market . <\s>
<s> Clearly , all of them ca n't be right . <\s>
<s> Most of them must be making their products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another way of seeing that advertisments make products seem better than what they trully are is thinking about this : When was the last time you heard an advertisment state any disadvantege to their products , any weak points ? <\s>
<s> I do n't think I ever did . <\s>
<s> But clearly , products have weak points and disadvantages . <\s>
<s> Even if all good things advertisments say about their products are true , those products are n't likely to be perfect , so by stating the good things and hiding the not so good ones , they are making their product look better than what it actually are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This can be understand if we keep in mind that advertisments aim at selling products , and so will do everything possible to convince customers of buying them , without attempting to provide an objective view . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , most advertisments make products look better than they really are , and this can be seen in the fact that most of them claim their products to be the best in the market and fail to mention any weak those products may have . <\s>
<s> From my point of view , human life is so complex that the only way to learn valuable aspects is by trying events that we had never tried before . <\s>
<s> For instance , an engineer may be a genius in developing complicated mobile phone services , but these services may not appeal to most of the people . <\s>
<s> So what he or she should do is concentrate on completely different subjects such as people 's needs and habits . <\s>
<s> Probably , he or she has never studied anything related to this , but the only way to obtain success is by trying . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Let 's see another example . <\s>
<s> If we worked for Microsoft and we would simply expect to earn money for the current version of Windows , Other company may create a powerfull operating system that would gradually substitute Windows . <\s>
<s> That 's why we would have to invest an enormous amount of money on a new operating system . <\s>
<s> If we do n't do it well the company will eventually disappear but if we do n't do anything it 's much more likely to disappear . <\s>
<s> Nowadays there is much more competitiveness than what it used to be . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Obviously , these measures are always taken after many hours of debate and requiere the support of many workers . <\s>
<s> But the point is that if we do not convince ourselves that we have to innovate , then other people will innovate for us and they will be successful but not us . <\s>
<s> Ever since I have been introduced to the learning system in our country , I have been always faced with two approaches while learning : The American approach versus the French approach to deliver knowledge . <\s>
<s> Whereas the French system encourages the assimilation of ideas and concepts for a specific topic , the American way tends to deal with the more practical side of that topic . <\s>
<s> But the question is : Which one is the best ? <\s>
<s> Here lies the `` chicken first or egg first problem '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some believes that the best way of teaching a student about a subject is by introducing him/her and explaining to him/her the theory behind that subject . <\s>
<s> This way , the student knowledge about the subject is enlarged and then he/she might be able to predict facts emerging out of it . <\s>
<s> As an example , if I want to teach someone about how an engine is turned on , I would introduce him/her to the mechanical theories and concepts behind it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> While this approach is followed by many , others believe that exposing the students to facts has far more impact than teaching the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> In other words , by being exposed to facts , students will gain the advantage of interaction and most probably will be simulated , leading him/her to understand the ideas and theories behind the subject in a more efficient . <\s>
<s> In other words , if we are to come back to that engine example mentioned above , instead of explaining the theory behind how an egine is to be turned on , the way to run the engine can be presented to the students in a way to experience and being exposed to that subject , thus assimilating much of the theories behind the idea . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I emphasize the importance of learning facts over understanding ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> I can still remember the effect 's power that a fact will leave on students , at least on me when I was back at the university . <\s>
<s> I was more excited and felt more involved than when listening to abstract concepts and ideas . <\s>
<s> I don-t totally agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> My opinion is definitely different from that . <\s>
<s> If we go to take a look at the past years we can only see a costant increase in the use of cars and I think it will constantly keep on growing up . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> There are a lot of reasons supporting my opinion . <\s>
<s> The first is the constant research for alternative energy also to be used in the cars . <\s>
<s> In fact a wider and wider area of the planet is under the threaten of pollution caused mostly by gas emissions in the air . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Even if this bad aspect exixts from a lot of years nobody has still found a solution and the result is an always much more polluted world . <\s>
<s> Another reason why we-ll never stop to use cars is because we are totally dipendent on them . <\s>
<s> We can-t live without them . <\s>
<s> For example if I have to go out for an holiday , not abroad , but in my country , I would take my car and not other transport means like train . <\s>
<s> Why ? <\s>
<s> Because I should stay at its hour schedule and it-s not so seldom that it comes on late . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my personal opinion a modest advice I can give is to improve the Transportation System in the country . <\s>
<s> As a student that has to take the train and the bus more than 5 times a week I noticed a big mess in every means . <\s>
<s> They are not only often on late but there are also strikes that cause a lot of problems to peole who have to go to work and should arrive on time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If we don-t try to solve these problems before , we-ll never stop to use our cars . <\s>
<s> I think we should take a look at some other countries where these aspects function better than here . <\s>
<s> For example I went to Helsinki two years ago and I never waited more than two minutes for a bus , a taxi or for a train . <\s>
<s> Every means was on time and in fact there were much fewer cars in streets ! <\s>
<s> Here in Italy it-s quite impossible go around our city and don-t get trapped in the traffic ! <\s>
<s> It-s terrible and sometimes a lot of people don-t have enough patience to wait and they start to scream or do very dangerours things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But every year nothing is done to improve the situation . <\s>
<s> How long still do we wait ??? <\s>
<s> I strongly agree with the statement that it is important for the students to understand the ideas and basic concepts of the particular course they are learnig . <\s>
<s> Simply learning the course will only get them minimal grades if it is a theoretical subject . <\s>
<s> But the few subjects which require the in-depth basic knowledge would surely not work in favor of such students . <\s>
<s> I can elaborate on this from my personal experience . <\s>
<s> During my graduation course in Mechanical Engineering I came across diversified subjects . <\s>
<s> Few of them were really not of my very interest but I cleared those subjects with the utmost concentration and honesty . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Subjects like engineering drawing , design of machine elements , dynamics of machinery , etc really requires a great in-dept knowledge and strong basic concepts . <\s>
<s> What we learn from the text books is just from theoretical point of view but at the same time to relate it with the actual practical experince is very difficult . <\s>
<s> If the student has all his basic knowledge about the subject clear then he can really relate the book information with the practical field . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If a student is having his basic concepts clear about the subject then he can really continue to learn more about that subject and will be able to grasp on that topic more easily . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Simply learing the subject because it is mentioned in the syllabus is no good . <\s>
<s> This type of attitude will not result any thing positive in his/her favor . <\s>
<s> For any one having a partial or superficial knowledge is dangerous . <\s>
<s> Such students after their graduation when enter into relative company will find very difficult to acclimate themself with the type of work being done . <\s>
<s> Because they do n't actually know how the particular process is caried out or how the particular machine works . <\s>
<s> At that time they will try and learn about that process which they are actually supposed to do in their graduation course . <\s>
<s> At the same time student who has donw with his graduation course with utmost interest and honesty will enjoy working out in the company and will ascend the success ladder must faster than the less interested student . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In all , students should always try and relate the things which they have learned in books with the practical knowledge ; which every one learns during his/her daily life . <\s>
<s> When a person relates his work or tries to explain the concept about a particular topic to another person he not only helps the other person but also bolster his own confidence and knowledge about that subject . <\s>
<s> Person can do this only if he has a good understanding about the subject . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , a good education system should always start with the understanding of ideas and concepts rather than with the learning of the facts . <\s>
<s> This is true from the very beginning of your education to the end of your academic life . <\s>
<s> When you start your studies at the primary school you are just a child , often unable to link the facts the teacher is trying to teach you , in a more complex grid . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The substructures of this grid are ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> Although it might appear easier to learn facts before understading the ideas lying behind them , this way of teaching always leads to a lack of background structures and , therefore , to a lack of understanding : children will learn facts by heart , yet they will be unable to collect them into a coherent structure , hence failing their tests . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> While a way of teaching focused on the understanding of ideas and concepts is the best choice for primary education , it can be really useful even in secondary and tertiary education . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For example , if you study Philosophy at the University , you will be thought nothing but ideas and concepts : is , therefore , studying Philosophy only a waste of time ? <\s>
<s> I definitely do not think so . <\s>
<s> If you think about how many former students of Philosophy you can find working in very different fields , you will eventually agree with me . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Why those former students , who never received an education based on facts , are so successful in the work life ? <\s>
<s> This is because they have a fully developed grid of ideas and concepts that always helps them understand quickly what kind of task they are asked for , even if it has nothing to do with Socrates , Plato or Kant . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , an education based on the understanding of ideas and concepts is a better choice in order to develop a grid of thought that enables you to vary between many different disciplines . <\s>
<s> Some people prefers to have knowledge in many differents subjects , which will stay broad . <\s>
<s> Other people prefers to specialize themselve in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> From my point of view , it is better to start with having a general knowledge in many academic subjects , and later on to spezialize in one specific subject . <\s>
<s> The arguments I have for this opinion are stated below . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I definitely believe that , until you are a student , you should follow different classes during the whole time you are at school . <\s>
<s> The reason is that it is extremely important to have a lot of knowledge in general culture and an overview of the many topics you will have the possibility to study in a more detailed way . <\s>
<s> For example , it is important to have a broad knowledge in biology to first know more about life on earth and second to be able to decide if you want to specify yourself in that domain . <\s>
<s> Otherwise , you might want to specify yourself in biology without even knowing if you like that subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Later on , when you begin to study at the University , I have the opinion that it is a better solution to specialize yourself in one specific subject rather than following many courses on different subjects . <\s>
<s> The reason I have this opinion is that regularly , students know which subject they like . <\s>
<s> Therefore , they should specialize in this specific subject . <\s>
<s> They will get interested while going deep into the details of this subject . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> This specialization will have a positive effect after finishing the University . <\s>
<s> The students who have specialized themselve in a specific subject will surely have good opportunities to find a high-paid job they will enjoy . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude , I think that the best solution is to first have a broad and general knowledge in many academic subjects to create a good overview in the mind . <\s>
<s> Then it makes a lot of sense to specialize yourself in one specific subject you find interesting , to expand your knowledge in that subject while having fun to study it in the same time , and then be able to find a good job in the future . <\s>
<s> Consumer goods is a big sector in today 's markets . <\s>
<s> There has been a lot of competition among numerous firms in the stage of persuading customers to consume products of firms . <\s>
<s> As an effective strategy , most corporations make use of advertising to attract customers ' attention . <\s>
<s> Though attention span of cutomers is limited since many advertising techniques are used ranging from realistic ones to unrealistic ones . <\s>
<s> It is obvious and necessary that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because this is a highly competitive business , and attracting attention of people on regular products is difficult goal to manage . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> It not our issue to argue that population growth in the world or , maybe , globalization caused the markets to be overcrowded . <\s>
<s> There is this fact lying on the floor and causing firms to compete harshly in an environment where the fittest survive . <\s>
<s> Small firms or the firms that are unable to cope with the competitive environment are omitted or forced to leave the arena . <\s>
<s> The firms survived were not necessarily the big ones but the clever ones to adopt strategies to sell their products such as pampering the qualities of a product in the ads . <\s>
<s> This method has proven its efficiency since we observe the products in advertisements lacking realistic representations . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In addition to competitiveness of the industry , it is also hard to come up with modifications that would differentiate the product from the competitor products . <\s>
<s> Not only existing technology of the corporation may not permit such a modification , but also the outstanding budget may restrain the company . <\s>
<s> In those situations , the most cost effective strategy is to use advertising that would put a magnifying glass on customers ' eyes . <\s>
<s> Playing with the colors , size , shape would help the customer to realize the product that is on the market . <\s>
<s> Throughout their monotonous lives people neglect many items that is shown to them . <\s>
<s> By doing so , advertisers are taking advantage of cognitive psychology and even widen the attention span of customers . <\s>
<s> Given the conditions such as lacking technology and inefficient budget , in addition to highly competitive market , it would be fair to use such a hint which would compensate for the conditions . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , most advertisements most of whom managed to survive , make products less realistic which is an efficient and common method followed in advertising sector . <\s>
<s> By doing so ' they keep on with the market and increase the porfolio of their customers which I would advise to every other entity in the market . <\s>
<s> I partially agree with the statement . <\s>
<s> The human race is full of diversity & complexity , especially the human mind `` No two people think alike '' & this is a major cause of conflict between individuals in everyday life . <\s>
<s> Thinking about the proverb : <\s>
<s> `` Successful people dont do different things , they do things differently '' . <\s>
<s> Being able to try new things , without pondering over the risk of failure , is indeed courageous , infact an innovation might seem precarious , but being able to work on it & trying to prove it to others , being able pursue people to accept it , is in itself a painstaking & tedious job . <\s>
<s> It would definitely consume a lot of time , because , being able to convince others , when everyone thinks differently , is in itself a cumbersome task . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Yes , one might be successful in the long run , because no effort goes wasted , but one needs to have a lot of patience & perseverance . <\s>
<s> For Example : trying to introduce a new drug in to the pharmaceutical industry is possible for a very diligent & patient person who is willing to carry out research , animal studies , clinical trials , approval from the FDA , then finally introduce the drug in the market , this can take up to several long years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In the mean time several small industries might manufacture existing drugs after their patents expire , which is quicker , entails less risk , and ofcourse surity of the product sale , low cost . <\s>
<s> Doing only what one already knows is definitely easier . <\s>
<s> Doing things `` Differently '' might involve an enterpreneur who comes up with an extremely lucrative marketing strategy , but about marketing the same products , which were not doing too well initially , but suddenly have started doing great . <\s>
<s> Here the person is very successful by not doing something different , but doing things `` Differently '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Success is not limited to few thoughts & strategies , but is a combination of various constructive thoughts & efforts , put forward by an individual or various individuals , to make things work in a constructive & productive way . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The definition of a successful person might not always be the one who is willing to try new things & take risks , but may also be the one who thinks of doing things he already knows in a more `` Innovative way '' & still be a huge success , for example : Donald Trump , who ventured in to real estate business , which is not something new , but not everyone who ventures in to real estate goes even close to Donald Trump , because `` he does things differently '' . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Ofcourse , the who knows how to take a `` calculated risk '' by making sure he doesnt suffer if the risk doesnt work in his favour , can definitely be successful . <\s>
<s> So i partially agree with the above mentioned statement . <\s>
<s> Adults and young people enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Adults watch their children grow , and watching them succeed every step while growing up , walking through harsh moments and surviving , such as their kid 's first smile , first birthday , first day of school , first sport match victory brings joy and happiness to the adult . <\s>
<s> Young people enjoy life too , mostly by playing and trying out new things . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An adult would have gone through many stages in his life , but that doesnt mean he still cant enjoy his time . <\s>
<s> What interests adults might differ from what interests young people . <\s>
<s> Young people are still growing up and having fun and doing activities and setting goals and ambitions would bring them joy . <\s>
<s> If a teenage boy , joins the school 's soccer team with a goal to win the championship against all other schools , and his goal gets achieved , he 'll be very proud and happy . <\s>
<s> His parents , would also feel the same joy , watching their child win . <\s>
<s> When an adult decides to have children , he would most likely be committed into giving that child all the love and affection he has . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' <\s>
<s> I strongly disagree with that statement . <\s>
<s> Young people would have alot of fun moments that they cherish and later on becomes a happy memory to be remembered , but who would have more memories ? <\s>
<s> An adult or a young boy or girl ? <\s>
<s> Adults know more than young people , and know how to deal with situations in a more serious and safer way . <\s>
<s> While young people have not encountered such a problem , they would feel stressed and scared , and would eventually seek advice from the adults . <\s>
<s> When a boy goes to his dad and asks for advice when he 's in trouble , then his father comforts him and ensures him everything will be alright after telling him what he has to do . <\s>
<s> The father would notice that his child is growing up , and is becoming more mature which fills his heart with joy and happiness . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> An adult with children would want the best for them , and he 'd be willing to do the impossible to ensure that his child has the best care and support he can offer . <\s>
<s> Experience is the main key that brings joy in life , and adults would have more of that than young people . <\s>
<s> Simple things would bring joy to an adult , a simple smile his child gives him is enough to keep him happy . <\s>
<s> While , young people wanna experience new things such as going out with their friends , playing games , travel to new places is what makes them enjoy life the most , and that doesnt occur everyday . <\s>
<s> But , an adult that watches his children grow more and more each day is what makes him enjoy life . <\s>
<s> Although there might be some reasons for agreeing with that statement I prefer to disagree with it . <\s>
<s> In the following I will write about three reasons why I do not agree with the statement . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First of all , I have to say that during my time at university I have met a lot of people who really felt the need of offering their help to their communities . <\s>
<s> I know that students often are not called young people anymore but I think that they are because they are still on their way of finding their own way of life . <\s>
<s> One example of their way of helping was taking part in a project where a house for children whose parents were not able to offer them an approprite way of life was built . <\s>
<s> Everybody who helped building the house did it for free . <\s>
<s> Another example was offering help by speaking to people on the telephone where again people did not get paid . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , when you want to apply at a special organisation for financial help it is always a big advantage to be able to show them that you have helped your community . <\s>
<s> These organisation like to chose young people who show the ability to offer their help without wanting any money and the ability to interact with people in a social way . <\s>
<s> If young people only help their communities in order to get that financial help they probably will get to know how much fun it might be to help others and how good it feels . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally there are many young people who make use of the possibility to spend the year after their final examinations at school with organisations that have the aim to help communities . <\s>
<s> In England that is called a gap year and is a very good thing to do because young people make experiences that are very important for their life . <\s>
<s> Since young people know that or get told about it they take that special year . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a conclusion I have to say that I know more young people who help their communities than young people who do not . <\s>
<s> That experience might depend on the surrounding I live in but even though I am sure that this statemant is not true . <\s>
<s> In today 's society , which is characterized by a hectic way of life , the desire of going everywhere employing fewer and fewer time has dominated the transportation market . <\s>
<s> The result is that in recent years the number of cars used has increased spectacularly . <\s>
<s> But , will this trend continue in the following years ? <\s>
<s> This is a very controversial issue . <\s>
<s> On one hand , the enviromental problems and future supply shortage are pushing governments to face the transportation problems in different ways . <\s>
<s> On the other hand , there are a big and powerful industry which will make hard to abandon the systems based on fossil fuels . <\s>
<s> In my opinion , the current situation is bad enough to compell society to offer alternative solutions to this problem which will result in the decrease of the number of cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin , the amount of fossil fuels available is decreasing very rapidly . <\s>
<s> Therefore , some time in the future will be no oil or gas . <\s>
<s> This is a cogent argument which should compell governments to take some measures to prevent that situation . <\s>
<s> This opens up a bunch of alternative possibilities to provide another means of transportation different from cars . <\s>
<s> The first solutions should focus in reducing the use of fossil fuels . <\s>
<s> This include enhance the use of public transportation , foster the use of bycicles in cities and so on . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Further solutions will take into account the substitution of fossil fuel dependent cars . <\s>
<s> The new technology develop to overcome this problem will result in new types of machines , which can be similar to cars , but will be no longer the traditional cars . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another crucial point , is the enviromental issue . <\s>
<s> During the last years more and more people are aware that the use of cars contribute highly to the pollution . <\s>
<s> In fact , in some big cities , such as Mexico D.F. and Milan , strict measures had to be taken in order to reduce the air pollution . <\s>
<s> Such measures include restriction in the acces to the center , in the days of the week one can take the car , etc . <\s>
<s> In conclussion , all the possible solutions indicates that a reduction in the number of cars circulating need to take place . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Summing up , keeping in mind all the problems mentioned above , it is clear that the current trend regarding the use of car can not be held . <\s>
<s> Enviromental , social and technology arguments indicate that new means of transportation will gradually take the place of today 's cars . <\s>
<s> Therefore , the number of cars in twenty years will be definitely less than the number of cars used today . <\s>
<s> The dominating idea of the 20th century was to have a wide range of knowledge about a lot f subject areas . <\s>
<s> However , within the new century or with the rising of the automation age we confront with complex machinery which needs its own specialists to operate . <\s>
<s> When we think of in this sense we see that for the new century it is better to have specialists rather than people who knows a lot about a wide range of subjects . <\s>
<s> It is the same also in the case of an individual studies . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The reason why I claim this is that the the science of physics have subjected us to many striking discveries such as the particle quark which is smaller than an electron and we have seen the implications of this discovery in the field of technology . <\s>
<s> We had machinery which operates with nano technology which is the discovery of the century . <\s>
<s> This discovery have fund its reflection in a wide range of the areas from health to consrtruction . <\s>
<s> The crucial thing about this technology is that it needs highly qualified professionels who are parts of a team working on the various different sections of the same project . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> These professionals in question spend their time merely on the area of their interest and this enables them to focus on the whole aspects of the phenomenon that they are concerned . <\s>
<s> In this case the effort is flew into one direction and consequently more quick and effective results are taken from the experiments or the researches . <\s>
<s> The notion of specialize in one specific subject enables resarch groups to get better results in the sense that every member of the team has his or her own space to do the necessary search on his or her topic and can arrange time without having any distraction or worry of completing various tasks in order to reach a result . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To sum up , in my opinion for quick development and effective results team work and to specialize in one topic is necessary . <\s>
<s> By dividing the subject among a group or basically by canalizeing oneself into one spacific topic success is more guaranteed . <\s>
<s> In our society , we have a lot of families which have more than two cars , whereas only one car can be driven at each time . <\s>
<s> In addition the oil is more and more expensive and to drive a car might become a luxury . <\s>
<s> That is why we can wonder if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> First I will show why there will have always more and more car in use . <\s>
<s> Second I will explain why I think that there will have less car in use per family . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First I think that in the world , there will have always more and more cars . <\s>
<s> Nowadays there still have a lot of poor countries . <\s>
<s> But some of them will become reacher . <\s>
<s> For instance China and India are countries which have each one billion of inhabitants . <\s>
<s> And as they have a quick growth of their standard of living , that is why in few years many families which have no cars will buy one . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> But if I am sure that there will have more and more cars in the world , I am convinced that there will have less cars own by one family . <\s>
<s> Indeed if the price of oil carry on increasing ( it is quite sure that it will carry on increasing because oil becomes more and more rare and difficult to exploit ) and if ingeneers do not find a new technology to replace oil ( for example electricity or hydrogen ) , it would affect the budget of a family and people would prefer riding a bike or taking bus to go to their work rather than using their car . <\s>
<s> In addition more and more people want to preserve the envronment and that is why there will have more and more people who will take the bus to go to work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude I can say that , even if the price will be probably very high in twenty years , it is quite obvious that the development of countries like China or India will be responsible for the increasing of the number of cars all around the world . <\s>
<s> But it is quite obvious too that , if we do not discover anothers technologies , the number of cars in a family will decrease because of the negative impact , of the price of the oil , on the budget of families . <\s>
<s> I agree with the given statement because in my opinion young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . <\s>
<s> Nowadays young people spend their leisure time with playing video games or watching television . <\s>
<s> They are surfing the internet and are putting on weight . <\s>
<s> Only a few children go outside to play with friends or do team sports . <\s>
<s> Nowadays most of the children are overweighted . <\s>
<s> They do not learn that there are other people with needs , opinions and feelings , too , which have to be respected just like they want their needs , opinions and feelings to be respected . <\s>
<s> Unfortunately many children only care for themselves and they are not interested in the opinions or feelings of other persons . <\s>
<s> They do things only for their own advantage and most of them think that it is absolutely unnessesary to help or care for other people . <\s>
<s> Maybe parents should give their children a pet so that the children can learn under the advice of their parents how to take responsibility for another living creature . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I guess that helping their communities would show them that they are not alone on earth and that it can be very satisfactory to know that you do something because it helps another person . <\s>
<s> In every community are several people that could use some help and there are not enough people who can provide this help . <\s>
<s> Young people could visit old people in retirement homes for example . <\s>
<s> They could take the old people for a walk or talk to them or play card games for example . <\s>
<s> In a retirement home is not enough staff to care for each of the old people like they would like to . <\s>
<s> For the young people it would not be much work . <\s>
<s> They would only have to spend a little time with them . <\s>
<s> It would make the old people happier and this way the young people would do somthing to help their communities . <\s>
<s> I agree the idea that more important thing for students is to understand ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s> The first reason is that if the students can understand and follow the whole ideas or concepts of one thoery , it makes easilier to learn facts . <\s>
<s> For example , imagine that you have to learn the history of the 1960 . <\s>
<s> If you learn a lot of facts related to the 1960 . <\s>
<s> In 1960 , there are enormous events and many detailed things you have to remember . <\s>
<s> At first , you can remember the specific things what you think significant thing , but you forget most of facts you learned the next day . <\s>
<s> However , if you study the whole structure of the history in 1960 and then add the detailed facts and organize well , you can remember facts easily than just learning facts without understanding concepts and even you can understand the flow of the history in 1960 without any extra affort . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , if you understand the entire ideas and concepts , it helps you can solve the questions on your midterm or final exam . <\s>
<s> Thus , it gives the opportunities to understand another historical facts . <\s>
<s> Most of the facts have connection with each other . <\s>
<s> For example , you already studied some historical facts in 1960 . <\s>
<s> There are some facts which have relation with the other historical facts something like some events in 1980 . <\s>
<s> If you know the entire concepts of 1960s history , you can learn additional facts related to another historical times . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The last reason , I agree the idea that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts . <\s>
<s> is it is the true that you ca n't understand , learn and remember all of the facts what you need . <\s>
<s> For instance , I have a test tomorrow and the test is for types of arts . <\s>
<s> It means , I have to memorize lots of types of arts including realitism , romanticism . <\s>
<s> If I did n't know the concepts of the romanticism , but I have to memorize the facts of the romanticism . <\s>
<s> So I start to memorize everything in the art of remanticism including the pictures , history , artists . <\s>
<s> Evenif I spend one week to prepare my test , I ca n't remember everything about romanticism . <\s>
<s> There are a lot of facts in romanticism , and it is impossible to memorize or even understand without understanding the ideas and concepts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The facts is small things in one theory . <\s>
<s> If you want to draw and see the whole picture of one theory , you have to understand ideas and concepts before you learn the facts . <\s>
<s> Understanding ideas and concepts is the most important and basic step to learn facts . <\s>
<s> I would not agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> I believe the cars increase rate will be reduced , however , there will be more cars in twenty years time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , cars have become a necessity in today 's world . <\s>
<s> Society is growing at a super fast speed , and a high efficienty is needed for people to maintain the modern tight life style . <\s>
<s> We have to admit that cars , as the fastest land transportation means , save us a lot of time in our daily life . <\s>
<s> People do not want to use too much time to stay on the road , which is considered as a waste of life . <\s>
<s> Also , the modern city tends to be larger and larger in size , and there is usuarally huge distance between people 's home and their work places . <\s>
<s> This situation also brings the necessity of the usage of cars . <\s>
<s> Let us take Beijing for example . <\s>
<s> Beijing is much larger than 10 years ago , and many people would like to buy houses in the rural places where the housing price is lower , while they have to work in the central city . <\s>
<s> Can you imagine what it woud be like if these people do not have cars ? <\s>
<s> They will spend half of the day on the roads , or even more . <\s>
<s> And in the near future , i cannot see any possibilities that cars number will be reduced . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> However , we cannot ignore what harms the huge number of cars have brought to our environment . <\s>
<s> The green house effect has made the climate warmer and warmer . <\s>
<s> The scientists pointed out that , if the temperature keeps growing at such a speed , our continents will be flooded one day , and by then , we would have no places to live . <\s>
<s> The atmosphere is no longer as clean as before due to the huge amount of wasted gas that cars have produced . <\s>
<s> It is causing a slow negative effect on humanbeing 's health . <\s>
<s> Public awareness should be raised to limit the number of cars , and actually many countries have taken measures already . <\s>
<s> In singapore , the government limits the number of cars by charging a high tax rate , and fewer and fewer people can afford cars . <\s>
<s> Taking this issue into consideration , I strongly believe that the number of cars will not be increasing as fast as now , in twenty years time . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , we can not omit cars , because they are playing so important a role in our daily life . <\s>
<s> However , we have to learn how to use cars properly , without destroying the environment we are living in . <\s>
<s> I think more and more people will be aware of this fact , and in twenty years time , the car will not increase as fast as today . <\s>
<s> It has been said that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . <\s>
<s> Some people agree with the statement because the oil which is essential substance to run a car is running out . <\s>
<s> But some people argue that more cars will be in use in the future than the present . <\s>
<s> It is more appropriate to say the latter because with the rapid developing technology , people can develop a new substance to run cars and the need for car will be increased . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , a new kind of substance to run cars will be invented with the technology . <\s>
<s> Some people might say that the number of cars in use will reduce because the oil is running out fast . <\s>
<s> But with the technology of twentieth century , people can develop a brand new substance to run cars more efficiently . <\s>
<s> For example , in the U.S , there is a research going on to make an engine which runs with hydrogen . <\s>
<s> A solar-powered car is already produced by many countries in the world and trying to make them cost-effective . <\s>
<s> It is going to take a lot of money and time but in a long run , it will save the human kind from the lack of oil . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Second , the need for transportation will increase exponentially . <\s>
<s> The population of the earth is increasing slowly . <\s>
<s> The increase in population will arouse the increase in demands to move to a place . <\s>
<s> For example , more people will travel to other countries and the most preferred method to travel is cars . <\s>
<s> If people need cars , the car factories will produce more cars and the production line cannot be stopped . <\s>
<s> Some people argue that airplanes and buses do the job but people who want to go to a private place always need car . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In a nutshell , the number of cars in use will not be fewer in the future than the present because people are trying to invent a new type of source to run cars and as the population increase , the demands to travel increases as well . <\s>
<s> People nowadays are too familiar with cars that they will not like changes in the transportation . <\s>
<s> Rather than make changes , they will develop a new method to continue the original transportation . <\s>
<s> Since its very early emergence , conception and ethical side of the advirtesement has been harshly criticized both by the intellectuals and common people . <\s>
<s> It is true that we all live in the era of globalization and capitalism of which the advirtesement constitutes ` the bread and butter ' . <\s>
<s> However , there are still significant opinions claiming for existence of certain game rules which will prevent adviretesements to make products seem much better than they really are . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> First , the ever-growing high competition in almost every market leads advertisements to develop such tactics . <\s>
<s> Given the high density of competitors supplying , to some degree , similar products in the market , embodying some fictional qualities to one of them is a lot cheaper than improving it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> For instance , taking a bigger , tastier or more delightful picture of an Arby 's or Burger King hamburger ( most of these pictures are competely fictional ) is rather easy and useful to take a better competitive position in the fast food market . <\s>
<s> It probably leads us to go and buy one of these burgers and this is the point when the responsibility of advirtesements ends . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To solve this problem of false representation of the products in market , it is necessary to have some sort of governmental interventions and regulations . <\s>
<s> For the sake of both consumers ' and competitor firms ' rights , ministry of economic affairs in any given country should have the right and duty of controlling the advirtesement market accordingly . <\s>
<s> As long as we do not have such instruments , fictional products are going to stay \ on our billboards . <\s>
<s> You can not know everything , that is a fact . <\s>
<s> But should we try to get a widely spread knowledge of many different topics rather than be a specialist in only one certain subject . <\s>
<s> In the end it depends on which solution is the best match with your personality . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> I am a medical student and I spend really a lot of time studiing but there are so much things to know about medicine that I can only learn a small part with my limited brain capacities . <\s>
<s> Hence , I try to be at least a specialist in a certain area with determined outlines because a doktor who knews a little bit of evertything but nothing exactly is absolutely redundant . <\s>
<s> So in order to get a job I am inevitably forced to concentrate on a few certain topics . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> By contrast , I think that beyond the job , it is very important to have a widely spread knowledge of lots of different things . <\s>
<s> An urbane person should know many different things about other cultures , histories and literature , because in that time we are living in so much information and knowledge is offered to everyone . <\s>
<s> Specializing would be insular in my opinion . <\s>
<s> As far as the knowledge beyond the job is concerned it does not make sense to try to know everything about one topic , because if you have a broad knowledge you have many topics to talk about with other people . <\s>
<s> For instance , I will try to teach my children things about world history as well as different languages so that they know a little bit of everything and can deepen their knowledge of these subjects they are most interested in single handed . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , I propose to specialize whenever it is neccessary , for the job for example as I already mentioned . <\s>
<s> Beyond the job I prefer a broad knowledge of many different things , but that is a matter of personality ... <\s>
<s> The issue of that it is true young people enjoy life more than older people do is controversial because on the one hand young people generally are more likely to be healthy and have energy , and on the other hands older people in certain conditions have more time and money to dedicate to their hobbies and their relatives . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As far as I am concerned , I believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do , and I will demonstrate why . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> During the last decades , in modern countries , life expectancy has increased and generally reaches 75-80 years . <\s>
<s> As a consequence , whether we do not consider very olde people who are more than 75 years old , people benefit from 15-20 years after the retire to enjoy life . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In this laps of time , which is more or less long depending on the country and many others criteria as the social and professional backgrounds , old people have the opportunity to do whatever they want to because they have the means . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Indeed , when you are young , even if you feel healthy and handsome , you generally do not have have or earn money to totally enjoy life , excepting very rare and dramatic cases . <\s>
<s> Older people do , therefore , they well and truly can do what they want to in our modern and expensive societies , where every litte thing has a price . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Furthermore , older people , when retired , have more time , more friends , their own family . <\s>
<s> In addition to this , they have more experience and thus better appreciate what they do . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Nevertheless , I am actually not trying to demonstrate that older people and forcefully and merely more happy . <\s>
<s> To enjoy one 's life is very close to experiment happiness but is not sinonymous with . <\s>
<s> To illustrate we can say that everybody does not need to enjoy his life to be happy . <\s>
<s> As a consequence , I would say that I think older people have more opportunities to be happy because they benefit form both time and money , but conversely it does not mean young people are unhappy . <\s>
<s> They just have more things to do , going to work , studying , starting their carreer , and related to this a less confortable situtation . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To conclude I would say that in developed countries old people generally have more opportunities to emjoy they life . <\s>
<s> Nonetheless it does not mean that youger people are not happy . <\s>
<s> It would be very difficult to say that the cars ' usage will decrease in the years to come so early . <\s>
<s> Looking at the present scenario , the rate at which the car production and buying is increasing , it can surely be said that their is increased usage of cars . <\s>
<s> But , however , I doubt to this and agree that there will be certainly a decrease in the usage of cars in twenty years and there are many reasons and notions for this concern . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> If we see at the awareness of the present population , especially the younger generation , they are more concerned about the environment today than any time before . <\s>
<s> their had been a tremendous increase in the pollution levels today that many people have volunteered to not to use cars . <\s>
<s> this however doesent mean that they are not using their cars at all but they have decreased their dependence upon them , in turn , their usage has decreased . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Moreover the public transport system today are playing a major role in a our daily life . <\s>
<s> The public transport systems like the buses , metros have really improved over many years . <\s>
<s> They have become much more efficient have also paced the lives of people commuting by them . <\s>
<s> At present the almost all major cities , which form the large portion of people using cars , in world have these transport facilities . <\s>
<s> There had been improvements in connectivity among different places which have atrracted people to use them instead of commuting by cars to far off places . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> A bitter reality that will result in the less usage of cars in coming years is the slow exhaustion of the non-renewable resources like petroleum , without which these manmade instruments will come to halt . <\s>
<s> It has been projected that over the years to come the petroleum supplies will be highly effected in the wake of many oil wells drying up . <\s>
<s> Its not only that the exhaustion of the resources is going to effect the usage of cars but its the economic problems associated with it . <\s>
<s> With the increase in the buying of cars alongwith the exhaustion of resources the petroleum prices are going up day by day , and a day will come when it would be impossible for common man to affford it . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> When considering all these issues regarding the factors affecting the cars ' usage it can be said that over the years it is surely to come down . <\s>
<s> Afterall this would be to the benefit of our society which has over the years forgotten and ignored the nature 's way of living . <\s>
<s> I agree with the statement that the student must understand the ideas and the concepts rather than the students to know or learn the facts because learning the facts will not help him to know about something practically . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> The best example for this is about the flights , you can only drive the flight only when you know the ideas to start the plane and the concepts to take off the flight where as learning facts are only useful to tell to others how the flight use to work . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So this means that ideas and concepts will always help in many ways like when the pilot is in trouble so then you would atleast know that how to land the flight as if you know the concepts of it how to land the flight down on the runway . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Another example is for example if you want to create a hardware device , you can only start when you have a basic idea on it , without that it is impossible to create a hradware device . <\s>
<s> Later you need the concepts to develop its features and the perations it needs . <\s>
<s> Learning facts is also needed here to make the device complete without any problems which the people who had worked on the other devices before . <\s>
<s> This makes the work more easier than getting into the trouble . <\s>
<s> But here we give impotance mainly to the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts this facts would only help us to complete the device quickly . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So students have to understand the ideas and the concepts which helps them in future when they want to research anything or they want to develop any product which is already existing . <\s>
<s> As they get succeeded they think or get ideas of doing more researches and developments . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> So ideas and concepts are more important the learni <\s>
<s> In my opinion , in education , in order to fully understand and deeply explore an issue , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> To begin with , learning facts , although important , is not sufficent for a student to develop a complete understanding of the subject . <\s>
<s> It is not possible to evaluate the facts without grasping the underlying idea . <\s>
<s> The knowledge of the facts without knowing what caused them and why is hard to be considered whole . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , without understanding the ideas and the concepts , the student will fail to apply the knowledge he or she has gained to changing facts . <\s>
<s> As long as the main idea is understood , the student will not struggle even if he or she faces a problem with different facts . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Lastly , the facts learned as a student can be easily forgotten following the end of the education . <\s>
<s> However , if one understands the key ideas and concepts , these will guide him or her to recall the information he/she gained during education . <\s>
<s> Exploring ideas and concepts will enable one to develop a strong notion of the subject studied , which is what makes one a successful professional . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In conclusion , as a lawyer who always has to be guided by main ideas and concepts in the face of unique facts of each event , I believe that , for a student , understading ideas and concepts is the most important part of the education . <\s>
<s> It is important to know a lot about economics and social sciences to predict in an appropriate way if the amount of used cars will decrease in the next twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Is there any lack or shortage of cars in our society ? <\s>
<s> It seems that every family and also every lonely living person has at least one car . <\s>
<s> Additional cars are not required for the private use . <\s>
<s> Because the population in my native country ( Germany ) is not growing any more , it is likely to agree to the statement so far that the number of used cars will probably not increase . <\s>
<s> It could stay constant . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Other questions concern the alternatives of driving a car . <\s>
<s> Travelling by train is still very expensive in Germany - the high prizes for petrol are not worse . <\s>
<s> Our train system still has to solve many problems ( too many trains are critically late , sometimes they are overboarded ) so that the possibility to use a train instead of a car ist not very attractive to many persons . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> One completely different aspect is the availability of petrol in the future and how fast an adequate substitute can be found and introduced . <\s>
<s> Maybe in twenty years , it could be the privelege of a few very rich people to drive a car , because the little accessible rest of petrol will have . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> How much cars are needed for the industry ? <\s>
<s> And what is the tendancy how the indostrial need for cars will develope during the next twenty years ? <\s>
<s> Here I have to display my lack of knowledge . <\s>
<s> Many articles , chemical components and other things have to be transported from one place to the other . <\s>
<s> The disire that the economy of a nation should grow for it 's own ` heath ' does n't suggest that cars could be less needed for oconomic purposes in twenty years . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> As a summary , it is visible that there are many different tendancys and developments which make it almost impossible to predict the amount of used cars in the year 2026 . <\s>
<s> I completely agree to the statement and I strongly believe that in order to succeed one should be willing to take chances/risks in life and try unexplored avenues . <\s>
<s> I 'd like to support my statement by mentioning following points and examples : <\s>
<s> Firstly , as we all know that we have to live once and as some people say that life is not a rehearsal , I think we have been given just one opportunity to explore different avenues of life . <\s>
<s> Indeed life would become very monotonous and boring if risks/chances are not taken and novel things are not tried . <\s>
<s> Having said that it should be taken into consideration that the chance taken should not harm oneself or others . <\s>
<s> For instance , if we think of the big names of business world like Bill gates and Sushil Mittal , they could not have achieved their current status , if they would n't have taken risks in their lives . <\s>
<s> These people were not well acquainted with computers and steel , respectively when they started but because of their willingness to explore and take chance they undoubteldy succeed and reached to the highest level . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Secondly , I believe that if risks/chances are not taken in most of the areas , it would definitely affect the rate at which we invent newer technologies today . <\s>
<s> Most of the advances are based on assumptions that one would succeed while attempting a particular task . <\s>
<s> For example , momentous discoveries like computer , internet , telescope , etc. would not have been possible without taking the risk and considering the possiblity of failures . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Thirdly , I feel that one should be concious of that fact while taking risks/chances that success is not always a surity becasue we always do not get what we aim for . <\s>
<s> So it 's not essentially true that people who took chances earlier are only successful ones , but there are people who were unable to achieve what they desired despite of taking risks . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Finally , I conclude that though there is no harm in working on only doing something that a person knows well , but i think that would make life very stagnant and our advancement will be badly hampered . <\s>
<s> So a person should always be willing to lookout for opportunites and take calculated risks in his life and sooner or later he would definitely taste success . <\s>
<s> Most products , regardless of their brand names , depend on advertisement as a main means of promotion . <\s>
<s> The question is : Are these products as good as they seem ? <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Some of those products have been in markets , and people have been consuming them for long now . <\s>
<s> These products have been able to maintain their quality and thus their name has survived until these days . <\s>
<s> We still even repeat their brand names , which proves that quality has outdid any role of advertisement <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> On the other hand , some new products have emerged , and manufacturers have tried their best to draw a resemblance between different products . <\s>
<s> Nowadays , if you are watching a commercial on TV , you can hardly notice the difference between products . <\s>
<s> They look the same , the way the product is introduced would also sound familiar to you . <\s>
<s> For example , in their commercials , they depend on showing the best of this product by getting it featured by a good looking model ! <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> Once the audience view the commercial , he / she would temptingly go and try out the product . <\s>
<s> But the problem that we are facing nowadays is that some products are not as good as they seem . <\s>
<s> TV , newspapers , computer , and other means have facilitated some ways to make all of these products look just perfect ! <\s>
<s> So people would go , buy or try some of these products , and later get disappointed by the results or the outcome . <\s>
<s>  <\s>
<s> In my own opinion , I think that there should be certain committees to be held responsible for the quality of any product , especially when it comes to advertisement . <\s>
<s> They should make sure that the quality of products would look as real as it seems ! <\s>
<s> Technology has a major role in making these products look better , but definitely it should not determine our judgment , insult our intelligence , or deceive our eyes ! <\s>
